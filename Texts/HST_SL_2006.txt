2006 was a transformational year for Host Hotels & Resorts. We significantly expanded our portfolio by acquiring nearly $4.7 billion of properties, including $1.3 billion by our joint venture in Europe.We are now invested in eight countries in over 50 major markets around the world that are represented by 12 premium brands. At the same time, we delivered outstanding operating performance that resulted in our stockholders realizing substantial increases in share value and growth in dividends.We continue to execute on our long-term strategic plan by aggressively managing our existing portfolio, practicing a disciplined approach to capital allocation and improving our balance sheet.We remain
focused on continually increasing the value of our portfolio and maintaining our position as the nation’s premier real estate lodging company. Some of our more significant milestones in 2006 include:
E Our operating results improved significantly across the board. In 2006, we had a strong increase in RevPAR of 8.5%, which when combined with an increase in food and beverage revenues of 6.6% and property-level cost control efforts, resulted in a sub- stantial increase in our operating margins;
E We acquired and integrated an outstanding port- folio of hotels from Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. for $3.1 billion, significantly enhanc- ing our relationship with one of the leading operat- ing and brand companies in the lodging industry;
E We established a European joint venture that has invested nearly €1 billion ($1.3 billion) thus far to acquire seven premium assets in key European mar- kets in Spain, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom;
E We purchased the 732-room Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, a spectacular asset in a high growth market, for $393 million;
E We executed on the most aggressive capital expen- diture program in our history by investing $530 mil- lion in 2006, including $255 million in repositioning and return on investment projects that we believe have created tremendous value and will improve the operating performance of our portfolio for many years;
E We executed on opportunities to maximize the value of our portfolio by taking advantage of the inherent real estate value of our properties. This included the sale of the Swissôtel The Drake,

NewYork and the Fort Lauderdale Marriott Marina in 2006 and, more recently, the sale of the Marriott Mountain Shadows Resort in Arizona in early 2007. Combined, these transactions resulted in pro- ceeds of approximately $620 million with a gain of approximately $365 million;
E We took advantage of market conditions to recycle capital out of assets that do not fit our core profile, including the sale of five properties in 2006 and an additional six properties during the first quarter of 2007, for proceeds of over $485 million with a gain of approximately $185 million;
E We opportunistically accessed the capital markets to refinance debt and raise new capital, which has resulted in significantly improved interest coverage and leverage ratios and the strongest balance sheet in our history;
E Effective March 19, 2007, we joined the Standard & Poor’s 500 index; and
E As a result of these efforts, we realized significant growth in earnings per share, FFO per diluted share and EBITDA that resulted in tremendous value to our stockholders in the form of an increase in our stock price of over 34% and an increase in our annual div- idend of over 85%.
Our accomplishments demonstrate a focused and disci- plined approach to running our business that has made us the nation’s premier owner of lodging real estate. Our focus on luxury and upper upscale hotels in urban and resort/convention locations has, over the long term, pro- vided excellent returns to our stockholders through appreciation in our stock price and growth in earnings and dividends. We expect to continue to benefit from strong industry fundamentals in 2007, which, when
matched with our aggressive asset management should result in meaningful growth in revenues and operating margins.We will continue to pursue our extensive cap- ital expenditure program, which we believe will enhance the already strong competitive market position of our properties and help provide solid returns to our stock- holders.We also believe we have the opportunity to be the partner of choice for real estate investment globally by sponsoring investment vehicles to invest in high- quality lodging assets in high-growth markets through- out the world.We are off to a great start on this strategy with our European joint venture, and will be conduct- ing research and development this year on markets in other parts of the world, particularly in Asia.
The continuing transformation of our company is the result of dedication to our strategic vision and careful stewardship of our assets. Achieving best-in-class perform- ance is a goal, not a destination. Our future growth and continued success will be guided by the same disciplined approach to capital allocation and intelligent portfolio management that has made us a respected leader in the lodging industry.We believe the future of Host Hotels & Resorts is bright.The potential of our unmatched portfolio and strong capital structure should result in continued outstanding performance and exceptional returns to our stockholders.
