Letter to Shareholders
We had another great year in fiscal 2015. The continued strong performance of our used, wholesale and CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) operations, along with the growth of our store base and our ongoing share repurchase program, all contributed to our record earnings per share. Over the last five years, we nearly doubled our top line, increasing total revenues to $14.3 billion in fiscal 2015. Since opening our first store in 1993, we’ve retailed more than 5 million used cars and 3 million wholesale cars – a testament to our brand strength.
In fiscal 2015, we sold more than 967,000 vehicles, including over 591,000 retail vehicles and 376,000 wholesale vehicles at our auctions, an increase of 10% compared with fiscal 2014. CAF income increased by 9% in fiscal 2015, to $367 million, and our auto loan portfolio grew to more than $8 billion by year end. CarMax net earnings rose 21% to $597 million, or $2.73 per diluted share. We opened 13 stores in fiscal 2015, ending the year with a total of 144 stores. We anticipate a continuation of our robust opening schedule, with 13 to 16 stores planned in each of the next three years.
The CarMax Difference. The value proposition that differentiates CarMax starts with the quality of our vehicles and the world class experience we offer our customers. Our goal is to provide a seamless experience whether a customer starts on our website or in one of our stores. While we continue to refine the new store design that we adopted in recent years, incorporating greater utilization of technology and touch screen search capabilities, all our future stores are opening with this design. We have also begun to remodel some of our older stores.
By the end of fiscal 2015, we had opened six small format stores, located in smaller markets. Based on our favorable overall experience with these stores, we are incorporating them into our store opening schedule going forward. They also represent an ideal environment in which to test and develop more efficient ways of buying and selling vehicles. In these stores, our focus on teamwork is particularly essential, as associates handle multiple aspects of a customer’s transaction.
Our online inventory continues to expand as we build out our national footprint, and our website visits continue to increase, evidence of the importance of our site to customers. During fiscal 2015, visits grew to an average of approximately 14 million per month, increasing more than 16% from the previous year. By the end of the year, visits to our mobile site represented 32% of total visits, while visits utilizing our mobile apps grew to nearly 17% of our online traffic. We are also in the process of a larger website redesign, including a responsive design capability that will improve the customer viewing experience regardless of the device used to access the site. Customers can not only use carmax.com to research the extensive makes and models we stock system-wide, they can hold a vehicle for up to seven days, set an appointment with a sales associate and request a vehicle transfer from another store. In fiscal 2015, approximately 31% of used vehicles sold were transferred at customer request.
Associate Development. For the eleventh consecutive year, we were gratified to be named by Fortune magazine as one of its “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Our associates take pride in maintaining the strong CarMax culture of innovation, respect and integrity – and are dedicated to cultivating that culture as we continue to expand across the country. By investing in the well-being of our associates, which is our greatest competitive

differentiator, we are investing in the success of the company. CarMax was also named to Training magazine’s Top 125 for the eighth consecutive year, an honor awarded to companies with the best leadership development, outstanding training initiatives and demonstrable results of training programs. CarMax regularly adds new training and reviews existing material to guarantee that the curriculum meets the needs of associates and the business. Over the past year, training enhancements included the rollout of a world class on-boarding program for new associates, as well as new change management training tailored specifically for all levels of the organization. Also, many top instructor-led classes became available as on-demand, bite-sized online modules, now accessible to all associates at any time to fit their work schedule.
Delivering Value to Shareholders. While the expansion of our business remains one of our top priorities, we have set a current pace of store openings that we believe optimizes our opportunity for geographic expansion while still driving continued operational efficiencies. In October 2012, CarMax’s Board of Directors approved the company’s first share repurchase program. Since that time, the Board has authorized share repurchases of up to $3.8 billion. As of the end of fiscal 2015, we had repurchased more than 30 million shares at a total cost of $1.4 billion. This program reflects both our confidence in our ability to fund our growth plan and our ongoing commitment to increase shareholder value.
CarMax Cares. Fiscal 2015 was another record year of giving for The CarMax Foundation. The Foundation was created in 2003 to enrich the communities where our associates live and work, and it has become an integral part of the CarMax culture. Annual grants during fiscal 2015 totaled $5.2 million, and the Foundation ended the year just short of $25 million in total giving since inception. Once again this fiscal year, 100% of our locations organized at least one volunteer team builder, and we established a new record of 800 volunteer events.
In addition to connecting our stores with local volunteer opportunities, The Foundation has developed a Board Service program to provide training and connect associates across the country with opportunities to serve in a leadership capacity with nonprofits. Ontario, California CarMax store Location General Manager Chris Petersen is an example of an executive in our organization who supports the Boys and Girls Club of Greater San Diego as a member of its Board of Directors. His was one of 66 board service grants The Foundation made to nonprofits where CarMax associates serve in leadership roles.
Fiscal 2015 was our second year of partnership with nationally recognized non-profit KaBOOM! Last year we committed to a three-year, $4.1 million partnership with KaBOOM!, and we have already built 18 of the 30 playgrounds we committed to as part of this partnership. Our partnership with KaBOOM! is bringing play to more than 100,000 children. It supports both KaBOOM!’s goal of ensuring that all kids get the balanced and active play they need to become healthy and successful adults and the national focus on Children’s Healthy Living that was chosen by CarMax associates.
In Memoriam. During fiscal 2015, the CarMax family was deeply saddened by the passing of our founder, Rick Sharp. In the early 1990s, Rick was instrumental in the formation of CarMax and he served as Chairman of our Board of Directors until 2007. His commitment to integrity and passion for giving back to the community continue to be our guiding principles. He left a profound and lasting impact on all of us at CarMax, and we will miss him.
In Appreciation. Again this year I would like to close by thanking all those who support our company, starting with our more than 22,000 associates. Their engagement and commitment to continuous improvement are what drives our profitable growth and maintains our strong competitive position. Let me thank each of them for everything they do every day. I would also like to express the appreciation of all of us at CarMax to our customers, communities and shareholders – thank you for your continued loyalty and trust.
