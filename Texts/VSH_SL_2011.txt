2011 was, for Vishay, a year of challenges.
For the Company as
well as me personally, the year was overshadowed by the loss
of our Founder and Executive Chairman, Dr. Felix Zandman.
Both Marc Zandman, our Executive Chairman, and I are
committed to carrying on Dr. Zandman’s vision.
In 2011, we also demonstrated our increased earnings potential
made possible by the fundamental restructuring that took
place in 2008 and 2009. We demonstrated our ability to react
quickly to a business downturn with tight management of
manufacturing capacities, inventories, and fixed costs. And last
but not least, we continued in 2011 to be an excellent generator
of “free cash.” (“Free cash” is the amount of cash generated
from operations in excess of capital expenditures and net of
proceeds from the sale of assets.) Vishay has consistently
generated in excess of $100 million “free cash” in each of the
past six years and more than $200 million “free cash” in each of
the last three years.
Last year we presented a growth plan that will lead to increased
EPS and cash available for enhancing stockholder value.
Despite the industry downturn in the second half of 2011, we
remain committed to pursuing our growth plan of intensified
organic growth supplemented by opportunistic acquisitions.
Whatever current market conditions may be, Vishay is confident that, with its
broad product portfolio focus on “free cash” flow,
and growth plan, the
Company is well positioned
to enhance stockholder
value and achieve long-term
success.
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank
Vishay’s employees,
customers, vendors,
strategic business partners,
and stockholders for their support during a very challenging year.
I look forward to your continued support in 2012 and beyond
