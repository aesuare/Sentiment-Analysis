We are pleased to report that Hillenbrand Industries made significant progress during fiscal 2001 on achieving both our strategic and financial objectives. We believe that on both of these fronts our performance was excellent. The Company entered 2002 with significant momentum and we believe we are well positioned to achieve even higher levels of performance in the years to come. Unfortunately, our strong record of achievement in 2001 pales in the face of the horrific terrorist attacks of September 11. Hillenbrand Industries is a company built around the idea of making a difference for people at the most difficult times of their lives. All Hillenbrand associates acknowledge with a sense of profound sadness the losses sustained by so many people on that fateful day. At the same time, however, we feel a great sense of pride in the courage shown by countless people ­ our men and women in the military, rescue and aid workers, health care and funeral service professionals, bereaved families and many others ­ who have personally confronted and found ways to overcome tragedy. Their spirit and strength are an inspiration to us all. The events of September 11 had a dramatic impact on all financial markets, especially the credit markets. The impact subjected our Forethought Financial Services, Inc. (Forethought) unit's predominantly bond-based investment portfolio to significant pressure, especially the high-yield portion of its portfolio. Nonetheless, we are pleased with our overall progress in implementing our strategies to realize the full potential of our Company and its operating units. Highlights of Fiscal 2001

within and a number of talented executives new to our Company. We created an Executive Management Team that, for the first time, clearly gives chief executive officers of our operating companies a greater measure of accountability for overall corporate financial performance. We managed through significant impairments within the Forethought bond portfolio. As a result, numerous securities were sold at a loss and others suffered from permanent impairments. We have doubled our efforts to ensure we are prudent stewards of these financial assets. Our individual businesses are now managed to maximize the returns of the whole Company, with each operating unit assigned and performing a specific role in our value creation plan. An over-arching theme of our strategy has been simplification of all business processes to reduce cycle times, increase quality, and clarify those activities that are important.

Exceeding Expectations Our approach to value creation can be summed up in a list of the five strategic pathways that Hillenbrand Industries has adopted. They are: 1. Profitable revenue growth 2. Improved asset management 3. Lower cost structure 4. Strategic portfolio management 5. Leadership excellence Expressed in financial terms, we expect these five strategic pathways to lead annually to 15% growth in shareholder value and earnings per share, and a revenue increase of 10% or more. If we consistently achieve these goals, we believe our performance will rank among the top 10% of all companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. In 2001, we delivered on our financial commitments to our shareholders and exceeded the investment community's performance expectations for Hillenbrand Industries. Our consolidated net income rose for fiscal 2001 to $170 million, or $2.71 per share. Earnings per share before special items was $2.89, 17% higher than earnings per share for fiscal 2000, before special items.

· Despite difficult economic conditions, especially post-September 11, we were able to deliver solid overall results in 2001 ­ record earnings per share and net income, before special items. We also achieved record consolidated revenue. · We clearly articulated and launched programs for accelerated growth in sales, profits and shareholder value. A new generation of leadership was put in place at · the Corporate office and within all of our operating companies, including executives promoted from

Consolidated cash flow from operations rose during the year to $445 million, 50.8% over 2000. Consolidated revenue was up 0.5% to a record $2.107 billion. We are very proud of these results and of the 10,200 Hillenbrand associates who made them happen. A full report on the Company's financial performance for the year begins on page 31. While these results are encouraging, we believe they are really only the beginning of the shareholder value creation we expect our strategy to yield over the years to come. Throughout its existence, Hillenbrand Industries prospered as the overseer of individual businesses that, for the most part, pursued opportunities largely in isolation from one another. In this way, all three of our operating companies built and sustained strong leadership positions in their primary markets. That method of independent operation, appropriate then, is less appropriate in today's environment. After careful review, senior management and the Board of Directors concluded that a strategy that links the operating companies into an overall corporate strategy is the optimal method to achieve strong growth in shareholder value. Our strategies emphasize profitable growth and cash flow, unceasing product innovation and quality improvement, and a strong focus on our most valued customers, profitable products and opportunities to establish long-term relationships. A Drive for Simplicity At the same time, we are engaged in a rigorous initiative to eliminate functional redundancies and operating inefficiencies throughout the Company. This is ver y much in keeping with our drive for simplicity in all of our processes. We are moving to common financial, legal, human resource, and information technology systems and processes among all our companies. Batesville Casket Company and Hill-Rom Company are consolidating their supply chains, concentrating on partners that embrace value-adding collaborative relationships that improve quality. And both companies are examining opportunities to simplify and prudently rationalize their product lines to continue to balance cost and customer needs. At Forethought, separate U.S. sales and marketing organizations were consolidated into one organization, thereby eliminating redundant

resources, streamlining internal processes, facilitating knowledge transfer, and lowering costs. Please note that for fiscal 2002 we have converted to a fiscal year ending September 30. This replaces our old fiscal year that included 52 weeks in some years and 53 in others, and better aligns Company reporting with our customers' business cycles and with industry peer groups. Growth With an extremely strong balance sheet and the demonstrated skills of our management team, Hillenbrand Industries is positioned to undertake an aggressive business development initiative within health care as we identify opportunities that meet our core criteria for growth, quality, customer relationships and innovation. Our acquisition criteria are simple. We seek companies that have excellent profitability and growth potential and possess additional acquisition or business development adjacencies. We will seek both new platform and bolt-on acquisition opportunities. To meet our goals of increasing revenue by 10% annually, we must add approximately $120 million to revenues each year. While we have outstanding businesses, our organic growth rate in revenues will likely be close to 5% annually. We believe our plan to expand within health care should allow us to achieve our targeted double-digit rates of growth. We are also fueling growth by increasing our investment in research and development, new product development and stronger customer relationships. These have been, and will continue to be, a hallmark of Hillenbrand Industries. We are targeting an increase in research and development spending of approximately 23% in 2002 over 2001 which signals our strong commitment to innovation. Change In 2001, change was under way at our most senior leadership levels. Two of our long-time directors, George M. Hillenbrand II and Lawrence R. Burtschy,

retired from the board during 2001. Both served the Company with distinction, Mr. Hillenbrand since 1986 and Mr. Burtschy since 1970. Their experience, many contributions and wise counsel will be greatly missed. As part of our general drive to achieve world-class corporate governance, our intent is to increase the number of outside members of our Board of Directors. We want to bring to the board a broader range of skills and business experiences to provide additional guidance as we enter new businesses and markets. We also have in place a new management team that collectively brings a strong performance orientation to our Company along with extensive international and business development experience. Strategic Response In the remainder of this annual report, we describe how our companies have responded to our five point plan for value creation. We hope you will agree that our Company is in an exciting period of transition and is positioned for accelerated growth in shareholder value. We believe the outlook for fiscal 2002 is excellent. We believe that we are well positioned in each of our businesses, with strategies to collectively achieve outstanding financial results while satisfying the needs of customers and all other stakeholders. Hillenbrand Industries today is an exceptionally strong company. We enjoy a strong balance sheet, dedicated and skilled associates, and products that are best-in-class and leaders in their markets. As a unified team, we are ready to demonstrate the very significant potential for profitable growth that resides within this Company. We thank you for your support and enthusiasm for the transformation we have undertaken during this past year. Hillenbrand Industries, its heart, spirit and best traditions intact, is now poised for what we firmly believe will be a remarkable period of growth and prosperity.
