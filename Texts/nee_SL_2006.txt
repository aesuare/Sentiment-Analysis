                To Our Shareholders
FPL Group performed extremely well in 2006, posting record adjusted earnings driven by continued outstanding results at FPL Energy and a solid year financially at Florida Power & Light Company.
In last year’s letter, I articulated three priorities for 2006.
The first was achieving our 2006 business objectives, which we said would culminate in adjusted earnings per share growth of between 9 and 12 percent, or $2.80 to $2.90 per share, expectations we later revised upward to $2.90 to $2.95. As we reported in January, we exceeded even those revised expectations, growing our adjusted earnings per share 16 percent to $3.04 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude the mark-to-market effect of non- qualifying hedges and merger-related costs. (See inside front cover for reconciliation of net income to adjusted earnings and earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share.)
Florida Power & Light (FPL), our regulated electric utility, fared well financially for the year, and FPL Energy, our competitive energy business, delivered exceptional growth in adjusted earnings.
The other two priorities related to completing our intended merger with Constellation Energy and beginning operations as a combined company. Though we were disappointed the merger was terminated jointly due to continued uncertainty over regulatory and judicial matters in Maryland and the potential for a protracted and open- ended merger review process, we have excellent prospects at FPL Group as a standalone company. We have a strong financial position, sound strategies and growth prospects, and great people.
FPL GROUP CONTINUES TO PERFORM EXTRAORDINARILY WELL
Our results in 2006 speak for themselves.
• FPLGroupprovideda36percenttotalshareholderreturn for the year, outperforming two key peer indices – the S&P Electric Utilities (23 percent total return) and the Dow Jones U.S. Electricity Index (17 percent) – as well as the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (16 percent). Our 36 percent total return was the second best of all major utilities. FPL Group also has substantially outperformed each of these three indices over the last five years. (See “Performance Graph” on page AR-5.)
• Netincome,usinggenerallyacceptedaccountingprinciples (GAAP), reached almost $1.3 billion, or $3.23 per share in 2006, compared with $901 million or $2.34 per share in 2005.
Business Review and
2006 Performance
FLORIDA POWER & LIGHT COMPANY
FPL, one of the fastest growing and top performing electric utili- ties in the nation, achieved a variety of important results and met a number of key milestones last year.
• FPL’snetincomeincreasedto$802million,or$2.02per share, compared to $748 million, or $1.94 per share in 2005. Lower-than-anticipated electricity usage stemming primarily from higher underlying commodity prices, the initial implementation of our Storm Secure® initiative to make our electric system more resilient to hurricanes, rising operating costs and a storm cost disallowance by the Florida Public Service Commission all contributed to a challenging year. Despite the challenges, FPL delivered solid results and is well positioned going forward.
• FPLserves4.4millioncustomeraccounts.In2006,theaverage number of FPL customer accounts increased by 88,000 or 2 percent, consistent with the growth we have witnessed over the last three years.
• OurongoingoutstandingoperationalperformanceplacesFPL among the best utilities in the electric industry. The amount of time our fossil power plants are available to generate electric- ity is among the highest in the nation, and the reliability of our power delivery system is also among the best.
• Wecontinuedtoinvestheavily–about$1.7billionin2006– to expand and enhance our generating facilities and related infrastructure to ensure continued reliable service and meet the growing power needs of present and future customers.
• Earlyin2006,wekickedoffanindustry-leadingprogram called Storm Secure to improve the ability of our power grid to withstand hurricanes. In the first year of this multi-year effort, we inspected more than 95,000 poles, cleared nearly 11,000 circuit miles of vegetation and focused time and resources on helping local governments that choose to place their existing overhead power lines underground. We also hardened four major infrastructure projects critical to the health and safety of the public, and we put into place plans to harden an additional 28 acute-care projects and 34 community projects in 2007.
• We made progress constructing a 1,144-megawatt combined- cycle natural gas-fired power plant at our Turkey Point site in Miami-Dade County, expected to go into service by mid-2007. In December, we received state approval to build another natural gas-fired, combined-cycle generating plant in western Palm Beach County. The first of the two units of the 2,440-megawatt facility is expected to begin producing electricity in 2009.
• Maintainingadiversemixoffuelstogeneratepowerisakey component of providing reliable electric service and keeping
rates stable. Natural gas is now used to efficiently generate about half of all power that FPL supplies, and though it will continue to be an important part of our fuel mix, it’s critical that our fuel choices going forward include fuels other than natural gas. In December, we filed a site certification application with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for a

                state-of-the-art, ultra-supercritical pulverized coal power plant, which will be comprised of two 980-megawatt generating units in Glades County. This year, we’ll pursue necessary approvals with the Florida Public Service Commission, and
if our plans are approved, we’ll proceed with licensing and then with construction, which is expected to take five years. In 2006, we announced our intent to file a license application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in the near future to create the option for adding nuclear power generation to our system. This would complement the four nuclear units we now have in operation in Florida, which account for nearly
20 percent of FPL’s power production today. Adding a new nuclear power plant will be a long and expensive process, but we believe nuclear power has a key role to play in our energy mix. In 2006, we were able to meet a small portion of our electricity needs through the purchase of power from renewable sources, but generating electricity using renewable fuels is not currently reliable or affordable on a large scale in Florida. We are, however, optimistic that renewable fuels will play a bigger role in Florida’s future, especially given recent and ongoing public policy developments.
• Duetohighfuelcosts,a1,000-kilowatthourresidentialbillfor FPL customers increased 19 percent, beginning in January 2006, and thanks to a variety of energy management programs and other efforts, we’re helping customers cope better and keep their bills lower than they otherwise might be. FPL ranks #1 among electric utilities nationwide in energy conservation programs, according to the latest U.S. Department of Energy report (using 2005 data). In just over two decades, our efforts have curtailed enough demand so that we’ve been able to avoid building 11 medium-size power plants. Moreover, in 2006, we provided additional energy management opportunities for both residential and business customers, and we expect that the additional savings from these programs through 2014 will enable us to forego the building of nearly four more medium-size power plants.
• Inlate2006,weannouncedthatwewouldlowercustomer rates by nearly 5 percent, effective in January 2007, primarily due to lower fuel costs than earlier forecast as well as more fuel-efficient operations at FPL power plants.
FPL ENERGY
FPL Energy, our competitive energy business and a leading clean energy provider with natural gas, wind, solar, hydroelectric and nuclear power plants in operation in 24 states, had a remarkable year in 2006. As the industry leader in wind and solar generation, FPL Energy recorded a 64 percent increase in year-over-year adjusted earnings in 2006. Over the past five years, FPL Energy has grown adjusted earnings at a compounded annual rate of about 35 percent. Net income on a GAAP basis at FPL Energy
was $610 million, or $1.54 per share in 2006, compared to $203 million, or $0.53 per share in 2005. (See “FPL Energy Reconciliation of GAAP To Adjusted Earnings” on page AR-5.)
New project additions, primarily wind and nuclear, along with a strong performance from our merchant power plant portfolio, contributed significantly to the exceptional 2006 results.
Operational performance was outstanding, with the fossil and nuclear plants collectively having their best year ever for reliability. FPL Energy’s 2006 results also reflect a gain of approximately $63 million after tax from a court judgment relating to an Indonesian project that was suspended in 1998.
• We completed another successful year in our world-leading wind development program, with new projects added in Texas, Minnesota and North Dakota, as well as the purchase of existing assets in Texas, California and Minnesota. In all, we added more than 800 megawatts to our wind portfolio, which now totals 4,016 net megawatts of owned capacity.
• Asforournuclearpowerplantfleet,weexpandedourportfolio and our strategic position by completing the acquisition of
a 70 percent interest in the Duane Arnold Energy Center in Iowa, which added 424 megawatts to FPL Energy’s net nuclear plant output. We completed a power uprate at our Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, bringing its net capacity to 1,098 megawatts. In December, we announced an agreement to acquire the two-unit 1,033-megawatt Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant from a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy.
• Alsocontributingtosuccessesin2006were:growthinour asset optimization and trading business, including full energy and capacity requirements services, and our retail operations.
2007 and Beyond
GOING FORWARD, WE HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS, SOUND STRATEGIES AND STRONG TANGIBLE GROWTH PROSPECTS
We are focused intensely on achieving our 2007 business objectives, which will culminate in anticipated adjusted earnings per share growth for FPL Group of approximately 10 to 13 percent, translating into adjusted earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.45. All adjusted earnings expectations are as of the date of this letter, reflect continued customer growth at FPL and assume normal weather at both FPL and FPL Energy. In addition, they exclude the effects of adopting new accounting standards, as well as the mark-to-market effect of non-qualifying hedges, neither of which can be determined at this time. The adjusted earnings contribution from FPL is expected to be in the range of $2.10 to $2.15, from FPL Energy of $1.45 to $1.55, and a negative impact from Corporate and Other of $0.20 to $0.25 per share.
IN SUPPORT OF THIS PRIORITY, WE HAVE A BUSY YEAR UNDER WAY
• FloridaPower&Light–We’llcontinuetoimplementour Storm Secure plan and our aggressive maintenance program to continue to enhance system reliability and resilience to hurricanes. To further ensure reliable electric service and to meet ongoing growth in demand for electricity in our service territory, we’ll be bringing into service this year the new natural gas-fired power plant in Miami-Dade County, and we have begun construction on our new natural gas-fired power

I discussed earlier in this letter. As we make these and other future additions to our generation portfolio, we’ll remain mindful of the need to help customers manage their bills, and we are committed to being sensitive to our environment.
• FPLEnergy–Withthefederalproductiontaxcredit(PTC) for wind energy extended through 2008, equipment secured and a strong pipeline of wind projects, we expect to add at least 1,500 megawatts of new wind projects to our portfolio by the end of 2008. Additional earnings growth will come from the rollover of existing power sales contracts to new values more closely approximating current market conditions. And we expect to complete the acquisition of the 1,033-megawatt Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant later this year. Importantly, the underlying earnings power of FPL Energy remains strong. Beyond the healthy pipeline of new wind projects, higher power prices and the addition of Point Beach, FPL Energy’s strong growth prospects include possible asset acquisition opportunities; fossil, solar and transmission development; and the continued expansion of our retail and wholesale power marketing businesses.
• Ourentirecompanyiscommittedtosustainingtheposition we’ve earned as a leader in environmental management and, especially, to demonstrating industry leadership in further reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In January 2007, we joined a diverse group of U.S. businesses and leading environmental organizations – the U.S. Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) – in calling on the federal government to quickly enact mandatory policies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions for
our country. In February, we endorsed the Joint Statement
of the Global Roundtable on Climate Change. The statement lays out a proactive framework for global action to mitigate climate change risks and impacts while also meeting the need for energy, economic growth and sustainable development around the world.
STRENGTH IN TEAMWORK
I want to thank each member of our board of directors for their advice and counsel throughout 2006. We have a diverse and well-rounded team of directors, each of whom provides a unique perspective on the key decisions we’re making in our ever- changing industry. Of note, I’d like to offer my special thanks to Frank Zarb and Jesse Arnelle, both of whom retired in 2006, for their dedicated service and many important contributions. In February 2007, Toni Jennings, a former lieutenant governor of Florida and long-time state legislator and business executive, was elected as the newest member of our board, and we are looking forward to drawing upon her business expertise and experience, as well as her vast knowledge about Florida. We further strengthened our senior leadership team in 2006 with several key promotions. Jim Robo, formerly president of FPL Energy, was named president and chief operating officer of the corporation; Mitch Davidson was named to succeed him at FPL Energy, and Mark Maisto was named president of commodities and retail markets. With Jim’s strong leadership, operational expertise and innovative
thinking, we will continue to advance our successful strategy and also find new ways to capitalize on the synergies of our businesses for added benefits to our customers and shareholders. Mitch and Mark both have generated outstanding results in their prior roles at our company, and I believe they will lead their respective units to new levels of profitable growth. Again this year, I’m proud to salute our entire team of more than 13,000 men and women for their outstanding efforts in safely providing reliable power to our customers and for their concern for the environment and for the communities of which we’re a part. This past year, their efforts were recognized by a number of important industry observers.
• Fortune magazine, in its “America’s Most Admired Companies®” edition dated March 19, 2007, named us #1 among Electric and Gas Utilities.
• Ourleadershipinaddressingclimatechangewasrecognized for the third straight time as “best in class” by the Carbon Disclosure Project, a coalition of global investors with more than $31 trillion in assets.
• FPL,forthethirdconsecutiveyear,receivedthe“ServiceOneTM Award” for top-rated customer service among utilities in the U.S., Canada and Africa. Specifically, FPL ranked “best in class” in the use of customer self-service options through the Internet and the automated phone system.
• EarlierthisyearattheWorldEconomicForuminDavos, Switzerland, FPL Group was named one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World. Some 1,800 companies were evaluated on environmental, social and governance criteria, and we were one of just 19 U.S. companies and only two U.S. utility companies to make the list.
As always, I appreciate the support of you, our shareholders, as we continue our ongoing pursuit of increasing shareholder value.
