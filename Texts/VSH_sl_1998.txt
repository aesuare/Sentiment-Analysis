  A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN
To Our Stockholders, Employees, Customers and Vendors:
 Nineteen ninety-eight has been an exciting and challenging year for Vishay. The Company started the
year with a major step into the discrete semiconductor components arena with the March 2, 1998 acquisition of the semiconductor business unit of TEMIC TELEFUNKEN microelectronics GmbH of Heilbronn, Germany, and 80.4 per- cent of Siliconix Incorporated (NAS- DAQ: SILI), a TEMIC subsidiary locat- ed in Santa Clara, California.
Vishay paid $550 million to TEMIC’s parent company Daimler-Benz for the integrated circuits (IC) business and the discrete semiconductor business. Sales of the semiconductor business unit of TEMIC for calendar 1997 were approxi- mately $850,000,000. Following the closing of that transaction on March 2, 1998, Vishay sold most of the IC business, which had annual sales of $300,000,000, to Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) and others for approximately $140,000,000. Vishay kept for itself all of the discrete semicon- ductor product lines and three integrated circuit (IC) lines; power ICs, IrDC trans- ceiver ICs and analog switch ICs.
  Vishay began its penetration of the semiconductor components business with its July 1997 acquisition of 65 percent of Lite-On Power Semiconduc- tor Corporation (LPSC) of Taiwan, for a purchase price of $130,000,000 and stock appreciation rights. LPSC is a joint venture between Vishay (65%) and shareholders of the Lite-On Group of Taiwan (35%).
We are very pleased with the 1998 performance of the Siliconix and Telefunken operations. Approximately $474,000,000 of Vishay’s sales in 1998 were due to the TEMIC acquisition, which was included in Vishay’s results for ten months of 1998. The recovery in demand in Siliconix’s major markets, telecommunications and portable com- puters, which began late last year is con- tinuing, and the market environment is expected to be better in 1999 than in 1998. Our new power MOSFET and power ICs introductions are doing very well with sales and profits up strongly. The IrDC components (wireless com- munications) are also experiencing increased sales and profits; they are used in all Nokia, Ericsson and other portable phones. We are encouraged by
the success of our Siliconix and Telefunken acquisition and we believe that as a result, we are now positioned as a leader in discrete semiconductor component technologies. This, in turn, should benefit our passive components business since passives and discrete semiconductors are sold for the same applications.
Apart from our Siliconix and Telefunken business, 1998 has been a difficult year for us and our industry. Looking back, you can say that Vishay’s high specialty products and cost reduc- tion across all product lines helped the operations of the Company close a diffi- cult year on a positive note. We main- tain gross margins at the level of more than 24%, which we believe in an envi- ronment where selling prices have erod- ed at unusually high rates, was quite an achievement. However, we believe that because of our continuing cost cutting and job realignment, we are able to remain the most profitable among our peers in the commodity passive compo- nent field. Contributing to our prof- itability is the fact that over 50% of our sales are in specialty and high-tech products which have higher margins
   2

  than commodity products and a much slower rate of price erosion.
In light of the past year’s financial crisis in Asia and our recent acquisitions of Siliconix, Telefunken and Lite-On Power Semiconductor, we have reassessed the extent of our investment in Asia. We have also opened our first capacitor facility in Shanghai, but we are proceeding more cautiously than we had originally planned.
Vishay had 21,500 employees as of December 31, 1998. 16,100 of them are outside the U.S., often in lower labor cost countries.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS. While the results for 1998 reflected a very difficult year for the commodity part of our busi- ness, we were pleased that we remained among the most profitable companies in relation to our peers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, sales were $1,572,745,000 compared with $1,125,219,000 in the previous year. Net earnings before special charges for the year ended December 31, 1998 were $63,547,000 or $0.94 per share. After special charges of $55,335,000 (essen- tially noncash) or $0.82 per share, net
  earnings for the year were $8,212,000 or $0.12 per share. Net earnings for the previous year were $53,302,000 or $0.79 per share (after special charges of $27,692,000 or $0.41 per share).
Sales of the passive components busi- ness were $1,027,902,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998 and net earnings were $0.86 per share (before special charges). Sales of the semiconductor components business were $544,843,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 1998, resulting in net earnings of $0.08 per share (before special charges).
Earnings per share amounts for all periods reflect a 5% stock dividend paid June 11, 1998.
During the year, Vishay recorded noncash charges of (i) $13,300,000, which represented an allocation of the purchase price for in-process research and development expense related to the acquisition of TEMIC Telefunken micro- electronics GmbH and (ii) impairment losses of approximately $23,057,000 related to joint ventures in China and Japan. The Company believes that the decision not to proceed with the joint venture in China will result in a more
streamlined organization in Asia and should provide benefits to the Company in the future. Also a $5,944,000 charge was taken for workforce reductions in Europe. In addition, the Company also recorded a loss of $6,269,000 relating to a forward exchange contract entered into to set the purchase price in connection with the TEMIC acquisition. Because of the non-tax deductibility of most of these charges and a $10,000,000 non- cash charge against deferred tax assets, the tax effect of these charges was lower than normal.
Gross profits for the year ended December 31, 1998 were 24.4% of sales as compared to 23.7% in the prior year. Siliconix and Telefunken combined reported gross margins of 30.1% for the ten months ended December 31, 1998. The passive components business gross margin profit margins were 22.5% for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to 24.0% for the prior year. Profitability for the passive components business was negatively affected by price erosion and the depressed Asian market.
Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1998 were 14.9% of sales as com-
    3

     pared to 12.2% in the prior year. The increased expenses were primarily due to the acquisition of Siliconix and Telefunken for which selling, general and administrative expenses were 19.6% for the ten months ended December 31, 1998. Without the Siliconix and Telefunken acquisition, selling, gener- al and administrative expenses were 12.9% of sales.
The Company is generating substan- tial cash and its financial condition is strong with a current ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company’s cash flow from opera- tions was $169,450,000. Purchases of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 1998 were $151,682,000 as compared to $78,074,000 in the prior year.
LOOKING AHEAD. During 1998, we believe Vishay became a stronger com- pany, and throughout 1999 we will con- tinue to build on that strength and our historical position as a leader in the U.S. and European electronics markets. We are focused on being a total solution provider – a complete manufacturer of passive electronic components and a
  major producer of discrete semiconduc- tors and selected integrated circuits. Vishay’s components are vital to the operation of electronic products found in a broad range of industries world- wide.
