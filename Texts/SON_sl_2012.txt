provider of consumer, industrial and protective packaging and services. We successfully integrated the largest acquisition in our Company’s history following the November 2011 purchase of Tegrant Holding Corp., which made Sonoco the leading provider of custom- engineered protective packaging solutions in North
America. The acquisition helped us achieve record sales in 2012, along with record gross profits, while base EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) grew by 2.4%.
In addition, free
cash flow (cash from operations minus net capital expenditures and dividends) grew to $101.2 million, compared with a negative $31.9 million last year.
Unfortunately, our performance in 2012 was not what we expected when we began the year. We did not fully anticipate the negative impact that rising commodity costs would have on consumers’ spending for packaged food or the extent to which the European recession and slowing emerging economies would reduce demand in our industrial-focused businesses. In addition, several temporary operating issues served to increase costs and constrain improvement in productivity. As a result, base earnings declined 3.5% to $2.21 per diluted share in 2012, which was still the fifth highest in the Company’s history.
Delivering on the Promise
In today’s challenging and competitive market environ- ment, Delivering on the Promise involves much more than asking our customers about the next bid for the next product. Our future success depends on developing innovative ways to respond to customers’ broader needs.
For instance, we must continually provide shelf impact for our customers’ products through value-creating packaging development. Furthermore, Sonoco is the only packaging company that can provide its customers with a complete line of retail merchandising solutions, including point-of-purchase displays, packaging fulfillment and supply chain management along with product protection
and security. Finally,
we can even help our
customers through
our recycling ser-
vices. Delivering on the Promise means satisfying our customers in ways we believe our competition simply can’t match.
Our work with the LEGO Group is a great example of how our unique service model works. Sonoco was first asked to provide packaging fulfillment services for LEGO’s products in Europe and then in North America. But the more we got to know LEGO’s business and challenges, the more we indentified opportunities to improve its products’ appearance on store shelves.
We suggested a new packaging idea in the form of
a colorful, reclosable flexible stand-up pouch. Only Sonoco could deliver every aspect of the new package, from design, to artwork management, to color separations and cylinder engraving, to precision rotogravure printing and finally packaging fulfillment.

As a result, our total solutions packaging won the 2012 “Best of the Best” Golden Cylinder Award from the Gravure Association of America.
But Delivering on the Promise is more than satisfying the needs of our customers. It means awarding our shareholders with billions of dollars in cash dividends paid over 350 consecutive quarters, dating back more than 87 years. We’re also Delivering on the Promise by contributing to the needs of the communities where we live and operate. Sonoco was ranked for the second year in a row as the top global packaging company for sustainability and corporate responsibility on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. We keep our promise to our employees as well by focusing on improving their health and safety and by providing opportunities for them to succeed.
2012 results
Sales for 2012 increased to a record $4.79 billion, a
$287 million or 6.4% increase from 2011. The Tegrant acquisition, which added $462 million in sales in 2012 and improved industrial volumes, was solely responsible for the increase in sales as it more than offset the negative impact of exchange rates and lower selling prices, stemming from declining

Display and Packaging segments, but was down in the Consumer Packaging segment. Total domestic sales were $3.2 billion, up 12%, while international sales declined 3% to $1.6 billion.
In 2012, net income attributable to Sonoco was $196.0 million ($1.91 per diluted share), compared with $217.5 million ($2.13 per diluted share) in 2011. Net income in 2012 was negatively impacted by $31 million, or $.30 in after-tax restructuring charges and tax-related items, net of gains from property sales and excess insurance recoveries.
2012 base earnings were $226.9 million ($2.21 per diluted share), compared with $233.6 million ($2.29 per diluted share) in 2011. The decline in 2012 was a result of lower volume and a negative mix of business together with higher labor, pension and other costs, partially offset by a positive price/cost relationship, productivity gains and the addition of Tegrant.

                to our shareholders
 At year-end 2012, total debt was approximately $1.37 billion, an $86.4 million increase from the Company’s year-end 2011 total debt of $1.29 billion. Cash and cash equivalents as of the end of 2012 was $373 million, compared with $176 million at
funds, using $135 million to pay off a term loan issued in November 2011 as part of the financing of the Tegrant acquisition and the remainder to pay down commercial paper. The remaining $27 million is expected to be moved during 2013 and will be used to repay debt. We expect to use free cash flow generated in 2013 to further reduce debt by about $120 million, which should move our debt-to-total-capital ratio to about 38%, compared with 48% at the end of 2012.
Focused on strategic imperatives
While we remain cautious about the pace and sustain- ability of global economies’ recoveries, we are focused on selectively pursuing opportunities to grow our businesses, optimizing operations and developing cost- management initiatives to drive sustainable cash flow.
Our first strategic imperative is to maximize sustainable cash flow from our portfolio of businesses, providing us the capital needed to invest in growth, either organically or through acquisitions, and returning value to shareholders by paying cash dividends and repurchasing shares.
For our businesses serving growing markets, such as those in targeted consumer product markets, we expect to improve cash flow by profitably growing the top line. However, we realize that some of our businesses, partic- ularly those serving more mature industrial markets, may grow more slowly. As a result, we expect these busi- nesses to grow margins and cash flow by focusing on improving productivity and managing working capital. Ultimately, we expect to categorize our portfolio of busi- nesses into grow or optimize groups, thus better manag- ing and rewarding their performance.
Our second imperative is to focus resources and investments on businesses serving faster growing markets. This includes certain Consumer Packaging businesses, such as flexible packaging and rigid plastics, along with our Protective Solutions businesses, serving
  the end of 2011. In December 2012, the Company recorded a transaction to repatriate $260 million of accumulated offshore cash, recog-nizing nearly $12 million of related tax expense. In January 2013, the Company received $233 million of those

                 Sonoco has paid 350 consecutive common stock dividends over more than 87 years to shareholders. In 2012, the Company increased the dividend for the 30th consecutive year and paid approximately $120 million in cash directly to our shareholders in quarterly dividends.
consumer products, automotive components and temperature-assured life science markets. In addition, we expect to continue growing in select emerging markets. For instance, we are currently expanding our composite can and tubes and cores operations into Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and Brazil. We expect these growth businesses to be able to generate at least 4% unit growth year over year. If we see an improvement in the global economy, we would expect an even higher growth rate.
Finally, we expect to optimize our portfolio of busi- nesses and invest disproportionally in our more strategic businesses. We have set a goal of improving Sonoco’s over- all RONAE (return on net assets employed) from a cur- rent return of 8.5% to 11–12% over the next several years.
Sonoco’s legacy continues
with new leadership in 2013
2012 marked the 175th anniversary of the birth of our founder, Major James Lide Coker. His proud legacy has been handed down from generation to generation and continues today through our belief that People Build Businesses.
After having the honor of serving as your Chairman and Chief Executive Officer over the past 12 years, I will be retiring as Chief Executive Officer, effective March 31, 2013. On December 3, 2012, I was pleased to announce that Jack Sanders, president and chief operating officer, would succeed me as CEO and had joined our Board of Directors. While I am retiring as an active employee,

I will remain as executive chairman of the board. In that role, I’ll continue to work with our Board on policy issues and provide my opinion to Jack when asked.
Sonoco doesn’t change CEOs very often. Jack will be only the eighth CEO in our 113-year history dating back to Major Coker. He is ready to lead Sonoco and continue our legacy of growth. Jack has played an integral role in building the Company over his 25-year career with us while leading nearly every one of our
Industrial, Consumer and Protective
Solutions businesses. He has been
successful in building new
businesses, acquiring businesses
and, when necessary, turning
around businesses.
One of the more important
roles of a CEO is to develop the
talent that will lead the Company
in the future. I’m extremely proud of
the team that I have led during my tenure
as CEO and am excited about the new leadership
team that is taking us forward in 2013 and beyond. On page 22, you’ll see Sonoco’s new leadership team. They are successful, seasoned leaders with strong operating experiences developed both inside and outside the Company.
In closing, I believe we have successfully transformed Sonoco into a global packaging leader positioned for long-term success. We remain focused on creating long- term shareholder value and providing average annual double-digit total returns over time. I join our more than 19,900 employees in thanking you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your investment.
