Dear Shareholders,

It is a privilege to lead this company into what I believe will be some of the most exciting years in CIT's distinguished history. Indeed, the company has never been in a stronger position as we look toward the future.

By all measures, 2004 was a very successful year for CIT: Earnings were up 33%; new business volume rose 16%; our managed assets grew by 8%; the total return on our stock was 29%; we cut our credit losses in half; and our return on tangible equity surpassed 14% by year's end.

With seven consecutive quarters of increased operating earnings, CIT has successfully created the momentum that will help take the company to a new level of performance for our clients and shareholders. We must work together in new ways -- increasing collaboration across all units with the energy and innovation of a sales culture -- to seize the opportunity before us as we compete in the global marketplace.

In 2004, CIT took several significant steps in building the framework for achieving profitable and sustainable growth in the years to come. We introduced bold initiatives that will further our capital discipline, promote an environment conducive to growth, and enhance profitability. We are confident in our strategy and poised to move the enterprise forward.

Our goals for 2005 are clear: superior returns for our investors, increased operational efficiency at every level, intensified strategic planning and a dynamic culture that is market-focused and customer-driven.

Executing our strategy to deliver the full potential of CIT requires everyone's participation. We look forward to working in partnership with all of our stakeholders to achieve these goals. By harnessing the full power of "One CIT," we can take this company to unprecedented heights.

Jeffrey M. Peek Chairman & CEO
