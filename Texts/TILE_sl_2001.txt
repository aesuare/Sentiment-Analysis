D E A R F E L LOW S H A R E H O L D E R S :

How do you prepare for a year like 2001? By anyone's measure, 2001 was unnerving for our nation and its people. It's hardly necessary to say that the events of September 11 worsened economic conditions already signaled by corporate consolidations and declining corporate spending--and created an extraordinarily challenging environment for almost every U.S. business. But as unexpected as the events of last year were,Interface was far from unprepared. We entered 2001 already determined to operate more efficiently and more productively. In fact, in response to tough market conditions, we'd taken significant steps in 2000 to become a leaner, more responsive and more customer-focused organization. We continued that discipline with added intensity in 2001--without sacrificing our commitment to new product development or compromising the principles of sustainability that guide our business decisions. We more than survived the year. In many ways, we've been strengthened by it.In both the short term and over the long run, we expect Interface and its shareholders to benefit significantly from the steps we took during 2001 .N ow, we have begun a new year with clear momentum to further increase our operating leverage and expand the power of our already valuable brands. Executing on these steps will position Interface to grow quickly--and sustainably--when the economy begins moving forward again.

$1,284 million in the previous year. During 2001,our net loss was $36.3 million, or $(0.72) per diluted share, compared with net income of $17.3 million,or $0.34 per diluted share,

in 2000. After excluding certain nonrecurring restructuring charges,our net income was $6.9 million,or $0.14 per diluted share, compared with net income of $31.8 million, or $0.63 per diluted share,in 2000. Inside those numbers, however, were some encouraging signs for each of our businesses. In a very tough year for the commercial interiors market, our global modular carpet business continued to show healthy revenue and profit levels. Our domestic broadloom business improved its profitability despite lower sales. Sales in our fabrics business stabilized after the second quarter, indicating a possible bottom in the commercial interiors market.The trend toward increasing use of underfloor air distribution in new office construction should increase sales of our primary access flooring products. And our services business was break-even, despite a significant decline in revenues. While a weak economy and poor business conditions may explain the past year's performance at Interface, we don't intend for them to be ongoing excuses. We're operating in a different kind of economy than we were one year ago,and, as an organization, we'd better be operating as a different kind of company. And, in fact, we are.

By the numbers, 2001 was a disappointment, particularly on the heels of our turnaround performance in 2000. Interface's sales in 2001 totaled $1,104 million, compared with sales of

that Interface is concentrating on to address the dynamics of our current environment: 1. Capture new segments. Historically, Interface's bread and butter has been the corporate office market. While we're recalibrating our operations to better monitor and match demand in this $8 billion global market segment, we're also determined to extend Interface products and brands into less cyclical market segments that we've not yet fully tapped. Specifically, in fabrics, we are concentrating on government institutions, hospitality space,window treatments and residential seating. In floorcoverings, we are focusing on retail space, government institutions, hospitality space, and education and h e a l t h c a re fa c i l i t i e s . These segments re p resent a logical, manageable set of opportunities for Inte r fa ce that, taken together, are larger than the corporate market segment. To convert all of these segment opportunities into bottom-line reality, we are introducing specific, targeted product offerings and deploying specialized sales teams to focus on these areas and quickly gain market share. These segmentation initiatives, coupled with a rebound in the corporate segment,should make our earnings prospects very exciting. As we diversify, we are particularly enthusiastic about the potential of our modular carpet-- a product that we believe is continuing to grab market share in the floorcoverings arena. We plan to leverage our dominant

position in modular, our innovative product designs, our mass customization capabilities and our global reputation to attract new customers and drive sales across all market segments. An overview of these segment opportunities begins on page 18. 2. Produce to demand. Balancing our manufacturing capacity, production and inventory against current and anticipated demand is an essential action that we've focused on during the past 18 months at Interface. Over that time, and without compromising our ability to quickly ramp up production to meet an economic recovery, we've closed nine of our manufacturing facilities. Evidence of our success is the fact that inventory was cut $30 million during 2001. In October, we announced a restructuring of several Interface operations,with the goal of realizing annual cost savings of $25 million when completed by mid-2002. Included in the restructuring are the closure and disposition of our Firth broadloom facility in England, a move that will eliminate $12 million in annual losses associated with that business and generate cash proceeds in the range of $20 million. These proceeds will offset redundancy costs associated with the closures and consolidations. The restructuring also calls for a consolidation of our access flooring facilities at our Grand Rapids, Michigan location, further rationalization of our U.S. broadloom operations, consolidation of several of our service locations, and an overall

reduction in our workforce. Since the beginning of 2000, we've reduced our head-count by about 16 percent. None of these actions is taken lightly, especially when they so deeply affect people's lives and livelihoods. But in the reality of our current environment, these are necessary steps if Interface is to remain competitive and generate acceptable returns. 3. Minimize our expenditures. Across every Inte r fa ce business, we have been carefully managing our costs and capital investments to help protect our shareholders' investment in these tough economic times, and to position Interface for dramatic earnings growth in the inevitable upturn. Our capital expenditure program has now been restricted primarily to those projects that can demonstrate a payback of one year or less.Based on our current annualized run rate, we've reduced our SG&A expenses by about $80 million from their peak in 1998, and we're focused on making further re d u c t i o n s .B u t minimizing expenses isn't about diminishing our future. We've invested heavily in our operating infrastructure over the past few years,and in making these recent cuts, we've made it a priority not to compromise that investment. We haven't shortchanged innovation,quality or service --or anything else that would impair our ability to grow our company in better times. 4. Tighten the supply chain . A distinct area of concentration in cost management is Interface's supply chain. We've challenged each of our businesses to become the best-in-class provider in their markets,and we've retained a leading supply chain consulting firm to help us drive this transformation.While this process is in its early stages, we believe comprehensive supply chain management has the potential to generate tens of millions of dollars in savings over the long term by further reducing working capital and operating costs. 5. Reduce our debt. Interface's global manufacturing capabilities, mass customization techniques and operating

efficiencies give us a strong platform for reducing working capital and generating free cash flow. This structure gives us the power to repay our existing debt more rapidly and strengthen our financial standing. In the current recessionary environment, Interface is still a positive cash flow business. Even if the recession in manufacturing and corporate spending persists, we are on track to generate substantial free cash in 2002, with which we plan to pay down our debt. Our target is to reduce our debt level by $40 million in 2002. This focus on debt reduction is the primary reason the Board of Directors voted in the fourth quarter of 2001 to reduce Interface's quarterly cash dividend, a decision the Board will re-evaluate each quarter. Reducing our debt level also will position us to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they arise. 6. Focus on customers. Our customer relationships are at the heart of everything we do at Interface. With more than 50 percent of the U.S. contract panel fabrics market, about 35 percent of the global modular carpet market and the most prestigious brands in broadloom carpet, we're clearly a favored vendor across our businesses. We also clearly have much to lose if we don't continue to delight our customers.Increasingly, our customers are demanding products that demonstrate an unprecedented commitment to innovation and sustainability, and services that are delivered with unparalleled quality. Interface has responded with web-based initiatives that make it easier than ever to specify our products, and with an ongoing investment in R&D to ensure that our products remain ahead of the industry on the environmental curve. And we've reaffirmed the commitment of our Re:Source Americas service providers to deliver a customer experience equal to our product quality. Through our global presence, we are concentrating our unique service capabilities to offer multinational customers one-stop, global shopping for their commercial interiors needs.

As we're doing a better job of diversifying and integrating our core products and services, we're also transforming the way we as managers run our businesses. Interface is a collection of 51 acquisitions made over the past two decades. Over those years, the Interface management style has been that of a holding company-- decentralized entities, managed independently, under a corporate umbrella. To help us better realize the potential opportunities and synergies of our diverse businesses, we're crossing divisional boundaries and focusing on operating as a team of executive s ,a ccountable to each other, with a broad, unified agenda. At the same time, we're being careful to embrace and encourage the unique entrepreneurial spirit within each of our businesses. For diversity of knowledge and critical decision making, this integrated management model is essential. And I am pleased with our progress to date. Before I conclude, I want to express my personal and professional thanks to Ray Anderson. In my view the stakeholders of Interface owe an enormous debt to Ray, whose position as president and chief executive officer I assumed last July. As founder of our company and chairman of our board, Ray continues to instill his vision and principles in this company, and his mark on Interface is indelible. One of Ray's most notable contributions to our company is our commitment to sustainable business practices--in the materials we use, in the manufacture of our products and in the customer relationships we nurture. We remain convinced of two things: a company that takes no more from nature than it contributes is not only environmentally superior, but economically superior; and sustainability is an increasingly decisive factor in what our customers buy, and from whom they buy. While sustainability has become a

marketing cause in our industry, Interface upholds it as a corporate cause --a commitment that extends beyond lip service and recycling claims to encompass every step in our business processes, from energy consumption to product reclamation. And we intend to draw that distinction more clearly than ever for our customers and their clients.

All this cost-cutting and restructuring might give the impression that our circumstances are dire and our outlook bleak. That's hardly the case. We believe we're not losing share in any of our markets; if anything, we think we're gaining it. We're not sitting on the sidelines waiting for the economy to turn; we're investing in a pipeline of differentiated new products now to capture new segments. We haven't cut our marketplace muscle; we've better defined and redistributed it. Our balance sheet is solid and getting stronger. Although 2001 was a trying year for Inte r fa ce -- a n unprecedented downturn in our core markets and an extreme test of our will to win --we expect what we've accomplished during the past 12 months to benefit our company for years to come.Already, we believe we're seeing the commercial interiors market emerge from its trough.If this upswing takes hold, and our operating leverage is as robust as we predict, we will not only have put the worst behind us, but created a lean, focused company for which the best is yet to come. As we all leave behind a year that is both forgettable and unforgettable,I want to thank you,our shareholders,for your continued support and confidence; our customers, for their loyalty and inspiration; and our employees for their passion and commitment. 2001 is over. And we're confident that Interface has responded effectively. I very much look forward to reporting great progress next year.

Sincerely,
