Chairman's Letter

211 Mt. Airy Road Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920 Donald K. Peterson Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer December 21, 2005 Dear Shareholder: Fiscal 2005 marked Avaya's fifth year as an independent, publicly traded company. During this relatively brief period of time, the pace and scope of change--in the global economy, in our markets and within our company--have been the most significant I have seen in my 35 year career. We began this new phase of our corporate history five years ago amidst a steep decline in the financial markets and in technology spending. The uncertainty resulting from these declines was exacerbated by acts of terrorism at home and conflicts abroad. From the beginning, we were determined to chart a course for our company that would enable us to succeed and win in the marketplace. It was grounded in a few simple principles. Leverage our expertise to lead our customers through a technology transition that would change the face of enterprise telephony. Invest in our company's R&D capabilities to ensure best-in-class technology. Differentiate ourselves by offering end-to-end services. Complement our capabilities and increase our footprint with strategic, focused acquisitions. Instill and maintain financial discipline and accountability. Reduce debt. At the end of the day, our plan was--and is--focused on building value for shareholders by generating higher levels of operating income, operating cash flow and earnings per share on a consistent, sustainable basis. The results of our efforts are clear. Today, we are a global leader in IP telephony. In fact, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we announced that we shipped our 7 millionth IP telephony line. We have a marketleading portfolio of product and services solutions. We have expanded our global reach in the key geographic regions of Europe and Asia-Pacific. As of the date of this letter, we have virtually no debt on our balance sheet. And we are a faster, leaner and more efficient company. Our progress has not always been as fast as we would have liked, and our results have not always measured up to our expectations. For example, as we've described, during the first half of our 2005 fiscal year we faced challenges, particularly in the U.S. But despite these difficulties, we achieved sequential increases in revenues and profitability in the second half of the year. I invite you to review the materials contained in the attached 2005 Annual Report for a complete discussion of our fiscal 2005 results. We are proud of our track record, of the strong market position we have built, and of the improvements we have made in how we do business. But we also know that there is more that we can do. And as we move into our 2006 fiscal year, this is precisely our focus: we are working hard to realize our potential and capitalize on the opportunities that our markets offer to us. Technology Transition: Toward Intelligent Communications As I have discussed with you in the past, we believe that the enterprise telephony market does offer significant potential. That's primarily because we are now at the beginning of a significant technology transition--a transition by enterprises from traditional TDM telephony systems to IP-based systems. This transition affords us a unique opportunity: to grow our business by helping current and potential customers navigate what can be a complex migration. One of the most important factors driving this transition to date has been the potential for customers to reduce costs, because they can run one converged network for both their data and telephone systems.

savings, however, are only the beginning. We believe the greater value of IP telephony lies in integrating communication applications and business applications. The adoption of IP telephony is increasingly about business transformation and redefining business process to improve the customer experience, enhance productivity and drive revenue growth. We call this "Intelligent Communications"--enabling workers, customers and even business processes to be linked to the right person at the right time by the right medium (voice, text and video) over any network. This gives businesses and workers increased agility through greater speed, responsiveness to customers and control over communications. The convergence between fixed and mobile networks is one of the most exciting aspects of the trend toward Intelligent Communications. We believe it has the potential to change everyone's view of what mobile communication is and what it can do for businesses. The goal of fixed-mobile convergence is to provide employees across the enterprise with access to their voice applications, regardless of their location, and to enable them to move transparently from one work mode to another. This convergence seamlessly extends the functionality of IP telephony systems and applications to a range of mobile devices. Looked at another way, mobility becomes another application of the enterprise IP telephony system. Strongly Positioned in Key Markets As enterprises large and small continue to migrate toward IP telephony, we are more strongly positioned than ever to assist with and benefit from this transition. The steps we have taken over the past few years, and particularly in fiscal 2005, now provide us with the size and scale to compete in all major global markets. We have increased our global presence as a leading provider of IP telephony, contact centers, mobility solutions and services to enterprises of all sizes. In Europe, which is the world's largest enterprise telephony market (Source: Canalys, Worldwide Converged Telephony Market Q3 2005 report, December 2005), we increased our market share through our acquisition of Tenovis Germany GmbH early in our 2005 fiscal year. The acquisition of a majority ownership interest in Avaya Global Connect Ltd. (formerly Tata Telecom Ltd.) late in fiscal 2004 enabled us to enhance our presence and capabilities in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region. As a result of these actions, we have significantly broadened and diversified our revenue base. In fiscal 2004, international revenues were 24% of our total revenues and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) only represented 13% of our total revenues. In fiscal 2005, with a much larger revenue base, international revenues were 41% of our total revenues, with EMEA contributing 29% of our total revenues. For fiscal 2005, we had $1.4 billion in annual revenues in EMEA alone. The U.S., of course, continues to be our largest geographic market, and it is here where the transition to IP telephony is most advanced. And it is here where we continue to be one of the leaders in IP telephony lines shipped. Leveraging our Competitive Advantages The foundation for our strong market position--and for our ability to drive future growth and success-- lies in how we have leveraged our enterprise focus, voice expertise, large installed customer base and end-toend services to strategically differentiate our company and our offerings. First and foremost, we offer customers an evolutionary approach to IP telephony, which enables them to upgrade to IP on their own terms and at their own pace. This is an important consideration, as it enables enterprises to protect the investments they have already made in their existing telephony systems, and it helps to ensure customers receive an appropriate return on new investments as those systems are upgraded. And it's an important part of our value proposition, as reflected in the work we have done over the past year to provide systems interoperability for the European customers gained through the acquisition of Tenovis. We also offer a broad portfolio of solutions--systems, applications, appliances and services--that address the differing needs of all enterprises, from the largest to the smallest. During the year we continued to develop and introduce offerings that extend and complement our portfolio, such as new editions of our IP Office product for small branch offices and companies, and new versions of our communications management software. To enable greater mobility for smaller enterprises, we introduced a new offering in Europe for

the small and medium business market that combines our IP technology expertise with the DECT (digital enhanced cordless telecommunications) technology that Tenovis brought us. In addition to our internal R&D efforts, we also enhanced our portfolio through our acquisitions of Spectel plc and Nimcat Networks Incorporated. Spectel is a leader in audio and web conferencing solutions, and Nimcat is a leading developer of embedded, peer-to-peer IP communications systems. One of the most exciting ways in which we differentiate our offerings in the marketplace is through the partnerships we have formed with other industry leaders. For example, we're working with Nokia Corporation and Motorola Inc. to extend the functionality of the enterprise telephony system to users of mobile devices. And through a partnership with Sprint Nextel Corporation, we're working to deliver hosted IP wire line and wireless services for the North American marketplace that allow us to jointly develop, market and support new differentiated IP telephony services to business customers as a full suite portfolio. Further Enhancing our Financial Strength During fiscal 2005, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet. We eliminated virtually all of our debt, roughly $850 million, including nearly all of the debt outstanding at the end of 2004 plus the $265 million in debt we assumed with the Tenovis acquisition. Our cash position at the end of fiscal 2005 totaled $750 million. With our strong financial position and solid operating cash flow, we took an important step in fiscal 2005 to build value for shareholders by initiating a stock repurchase program. Our board of directors authorized a two-year plan under which we may repurchase up to $500 million of our shares. At the end of fiscal 2005, we had repurchased a total of 11.5 million shares for a total of $107 million under this plan. Moving Forward Over the last few years, we've transformed Avaya to capitalize on the opportunities we see in the global enterprise telephony market as firms start the transition to IP systems and applications. We've upgraded and enhanced our product and service portfolio. We've expanded our presence in the market through our strategic acquisitions and partnerships. We've improved our operations and demonstrated our commitment to maintaining our financial discipline. We've strengthened our balance sheet and improved profitability. In short, we're a stronger, more competitive company today--a company that is positioned to drive and benefit from the transition to IP telephony in all of the markets in which we operate. This transition is moving along at a healthy pace, and we believe that it will broaden in key markets, such as Europe. As we move into fiscal 2006, we're very excited about the opportunities ahead. Everyone at Avaya has contributed to our success, and I want to thank our employees, our management team and our Board of Directors for their hard work. I would also like to thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support of our efforts. Sincerely, Donald K. Peterson Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
