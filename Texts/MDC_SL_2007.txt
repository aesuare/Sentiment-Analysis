POISED FOR OPPORTUNITY

Over a period spanning four decades, we have developed the flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions. We have prospered by turning challenges into opportunities. At the heart of our business model is the strategic objective to hold our land supply to a conservative level, while limiting our investment in unsold homes. This direction has enabled us to achieve and maintain a strong balance sheet with significant levels of cash, low debt and substantial equity, which provides us the ability to seek out opportunities in the current economic environment.
CLEAR VISION, SOLID RESULTS

"Our vision and strategy are the keys to our success. They keep us focused during challenging times and position us to be even stronger when the industry improves." Larry A. Mizel
Chairman & CEO

We know that a strong balance sheet is critical to our longterm success in operating within homebuilding's cyclical nature. At the start of the year, we already considered our financial standing to be among the best in the industry, as evidenced by our "investment-grade" rating--a distinction we have held from all three major rating agencies for more than four years. And yet we continued to make improvements to our financial position in 2007 by many measures, including the following:   reducing our inventories by $1.3 billion;   decreasing the number of lots we own by 40% and the number of lots we have under option by 55%;   generating more than $590 million in cash flow from operations and ending the year with $1 billion in cash; and   increasing our total cash and available borrowing capacity by 30% to more than $2.2 billion.
