  Fellow Shareholders,
We have the ability every single day at Hill-Rom to influ- ence millions of lives. Each year offers us an opportunity to make a lasting difference in the world of healthcare and continue our company’s legacy of caring, commit- ment and innovation.
I am proud of what we accomplished at Hill-Rom during the past year. We delivered on our key objectives. Hill-Rom embraced innovation in our products and processes.
We strengthened our overall operational performance and enhanced our financial condition, which will enable us to invest in future opportunities for profitable, sustain- able growth. Our teams accomplished all of this during some of the most challenging global economic conditions in decades.
Our focus on creating value throughout our business is something that customers and shareholders can rely
on year after year. The stories that follow in this annual report highlight not only our accomplishments in 2011 but also our confidence in our continued success in 2012 and beyond.
Leadership
During 2011, we further solidified the leadership team
at Hill-Rom, including the strengthening of our manage- ment infrastructure for our regional operations in Europe, Latin America, Middle East and Asia Pacific. Over the
past two years, we assembled a group of executives with the right experience and chemistry to help drive our company forward and achieve our strategic and financial objectives. The team includes both Hill-Rom veterans and executives from other top global medical device and healthcare companies. They bring not only many years of global healthcare experience, but also a demonstrated track record of success in producing profitable growth.
Financial Results
Despite global macroeconomic conditions and pressures on reimbursement, our businesses performed well. Our 29% increase in adjusted earnings per share and full year revenue growth of 8% for 2011 are achievements of which we are very proud.
We focused the entire organization on driving revenue growth, expanding our margins, leveraging our cost structure, increasing our focus on innovation, and driving sustainable improvements in our operating cash flow.
We made tremendous progress on all of these fronts. Our North America Acute Care business led the way in financial performance for our company, with record sales posted in several areas. The International and Post-Acute businesses had challenges due to difficult market condi- tions, but posted solid results for the year.

  “As we keep our eyes and our efforts squarely focused on the difference we can make, we could not be more excited about where we are going and the accomplishments yet to come.”
We generated strong operating cash flow in 2011, posting a 59% increase over 2010 to more than $222 million. Dur- ing the year, we increased our annual quarterly dividend 9% and we repurchased $110 million of our stock. We move into 2012 with a strong financial position.
Operating Performance
During the year, we continued to improve the operating performance of our company. Our full year adjusted operating margin grew to 13.5%, a 100-basis points improvement compared to 2010.
We are working across the organization to optimize our structure and processes in order to simplify our company and drive improvements across our businesses. One example of this was the consolidation of our North America sales and service organizations where we are leveraging our strengths in the marketplace. We are seeing, and more importantly our customers are seeing, the benefits of better coordination.
John J. Greisch
President & CEO, Hill-Rom
Continuous improvement initiatives were implemented throughout the company, producing process efficiencies and better outcomes in sourcing, manufacturing, inven- tory control, sales operations and planning, order to cash and other key systems.
We realized the benefits of investments we made in 2010 to our manufacturing infrastructure. Our manufacturing facility in Monterrey, Mexico, has again achieved out- standing results in 2011 for productivity and safety standards, while delivering a 37% increase in output compared to 2010.
The Hill-Rom team is focused on maximizing the power of our brand, leveraging our channel strength and driving performance improvement across our company. That momentum and focus have positioned us well for con- tinued growth in 2012.

in the story about Sarah Houlahan in the pages that follow. It also can be a reduction in ventilator associated pneumonia at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Orange County, California. Or, it can mean a desperately needed delivery of refurbished Hill-Rom products by our Hospital Beds
