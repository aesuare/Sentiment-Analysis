 THE HANOVER INSURANCE GROUP | 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
 From the CEO
  Fred Eppinger
To Our Shareholders,
2015 was a year marked by strong financial and operational achievements for our company, as we continued
to leverage the investments we have made across our organization. In the face of significant and prolonged market and competitive pressure,
we maintained our strategic focus and sustained progress on all fronts. As a result, our company is stronger and better positioned today than ever to consistently deliver solid results and create value for our shareholders
and all of our other stakeholders.
CREATING VALUE
Over the years, we have developed a distinctive value proposition, building a broad and innovative product portfolio, deep partnerships with leading independent agents, and teams with expertise and authority deployed in local markets to provide our partners and their customers with the high
quality, responsive insurance solutions they expect and deserve.
The effectiveness and consistent execution of our strategy is evident in our results. During 2015, we delivered solid earnings growth for the third consecutive year, generating record earnings per share, while maintaining our trademark, disciplined underwriting practices.

   With our earnings capacity continuing to grow, a strong operating ROE of 11 percent, and our company in excellent financial condition, we increased our capital flexibility and book value. We once again delivered excess capital to our shareholders, increasing dividends for the 11th consecutive year, and returning more than $100 million through share repurchases. Our success
was recognized by the market, as our total shareholder return ranked as one of the best among insurers over the last one-, two-, three-, and 10-year periods. Our performance also was acknowledged by Standard & Poor’s, as the rating agency upgraded our financial strength rating to “A.”
CAPITALIZING ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES
Competitive pressure continued to mount during 2015, as excess industry capacity created additional pricing pressure in many sectors and acted as a catalyst for further structural change and consolidation among carriers and agencies. In this environment, we con- tinued to identify and take advantage of promising growth opportunities,
achieved solid growth through quality new business and sound pricing actions, while simultaneously improving retention. In Commercial Lines, we solidified our market position, growing six percent, which exceeded the industry average. In Personal Lines, we generated positive growth and momentum as well, after three years of carefully planned exposure management initiatives. Internationally, through Chaucer, we focused on writing business in industry segments where the return on capital was the most attractive, and wrote less business in segments characterized by significant pricing pressure. We also successfully exited the U.K. motor business to concentrate Chaucer’s focus and resources on enhancing its leading

of our overall Commercial Lines growth. We also achieved growth by expanding our most profitable businesses, including growth in targeted industry classes in middle market and reaching more than $700 million in our small commercial segment, which positions us among the top small commercial writers in the United States. We had similar success in Chaucer casualty and marine, as well as domestic marine, healthcare, and specialty industrial, among others — all very profitable businesses, which help us grow underwriting margins and build earnings resiliency.
In addition, we invested heavily in
product innovation and continued
our efforts to enhance our mix of

We continued the roll-out of our distinctive, account-oriented Hanover Platinum Experience offering in Personal Lines, which is now available in 16 of our 17 markets. And, at Chaucer, we further invested in political risk, cargo, and other classes to build
upon select specialty classes with complementary products, underwriting expertise, and broader geographies. With these new specialized products, we attracted business that values our capacity, technical expertise, and service quality.
