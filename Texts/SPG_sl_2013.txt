  FROM THE CHAIRMAN & CEO
Dear Fellow Stockholders,
First and foremost, if I may, let me start by thanking my colleagues for delivering a record-breaking year to you, our stockholders. From our maintenance and management staff
to our leasing and development personnel at headquarters
and all in between, everyone did their part in delivering these impressive results. The quality of the people at Simon Property Group (“SPG”) and, of course, our properties combined to generate record-setting results. Our funds from operations (“FFO”) increased from a strong 2012 by 10.9% to $8.85 per share. Since the great recession, the growth per share of FFO has totaled 76%. We increased our dividend for 2013 by 13.4% to a total of $4.65 per common share, an increase of 79% since the great recession, and with the recent increase in the first quarter of 2014 to $1.25 per share we are now on track to pay $5.00 per share this year. Our FFO per share of $8.85 is also a record for the REIT industry. Once again, I am so proud of how the company has delivered financial and operational results coming out of the great recession, as well as over our 20-year history as a public company which we quietly celebrated at the the end of last year.
 
 Now if I can, let’s briefly look back over the last 20 years. Our company has achieved growth and scale that few could have imagined possible: our FFO has grown from $150 million in 1993 to $3.2 billion in 2013, total consolidated revenues have increased more than twelve times from $424 million to
$5.2 billion, and the market value of our portfolio increased from $3 billion to $85 billion. In addition to adding quality real estate to our portfolio, we’ve added new markets and new product types, while always sticking with what we know best: retail real estate. Across 20 years of history, our commitment to business growth that generates shareholder value has remained our top priority. From our IPO in December of 1993 through year-end 2013, ownership of common stock of Simon Property Group (SPG) provided a total return to stockholders of 1,915%. If I may quote Adam Sandler as
Mr. Longfellow Deeds, “that’s not too shabby.”
Our core strengths of capital allocation, balance sheet management, and operating expertise continue to fuel our growth, making it possible to deliver our impressive financial results. We continually set the bar higher as property owners and as stewards of capital. This is not new for us, and we will always be looking for additional opportunities to deliver results.
We measure our success through growth of our operating income, and I am pleased to report that we continued
this positive trend for our twentieth year. Our share of net operating income (NOI) in 2013 increased 10% to more than $4.8 billion. By comparison, our share of NOI in 1993 was $296 million. It would be easy to rest on our laurels and take a breath and not find new and exciting ways to improve
our product and ultimately our cash flow, but our culture won’t allow that nor will our people. So that was the last 20 years, and now we are focusing on the future.
Active management, smart acquisitions, and continued investment in our properties will continue. And let me reiterate what I said in my 2008 shareholder letter paraphrasing Mark Twain, “The death of the mall is greatly exaggerated.” The proof as they say is in the pudding. I respectfully ask you to review our results and hopefully you will come to the same conclusion. As I look back on 2013, there was little debate
on this for the first six months of the year as our retailers continued to post sales increases. However, as the year went on and the weaker than expected holiday shopping season transpired, it became the topic du jour. Of course, I was disappointed in overall retail sales, but I don’t attribute it to
a paradigm shift away from quality retail real estate. Instead,
I believe we had a perfect storm (literally and figuratively) that led to anemic sales for our retailers (not SPG), including a short holiday selling season compared to 2012, a shift
to durable goods that was cyclical in nature, an increase in income taxes, and general economic and political uncertainty. However temporary this slowdown in the fourth quarter and the early part of 2014 is, we will react as if it is not and will continue to improve our customer experience while driving traffic to our shopping centers.
Before we turn to 2013 highlights, let’s focus on our stock performance for 2013. Clearly we were disappointed the stock was relatively flat given the S&P 500 had such a strong year. This is a rarity for us. In fact, we have outperformed the S&P 500 12 times in the last 14 years. Also, given the strength of our earnings it is not something we would have anticipated. However, it happens and we won’t waiver from our strategy that has produced industry-leading results year after year. We can attribute last year’s stock price performance (or lack thereof) to sector rotation and investor concern over the impact of potentially rising interest rates that overlooked our strong fundamentals. Fortunately, your stock has increased this year to date.
Now let’s turn to 2013 highlights.
2013 FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
We reached new heights in 2013 for consolidated revenue and FFO:
• Consolidated revenue increased 5.9% to $5.170 billion.
• Net income was $1.316 billion.
• FFO increased to $3.206 billion, or $8.85 per diluted share, a year over year increase of 10.9%.
Our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets once again delivered strong financial and operational results:
• Comparable property NOI growth was 5.2%.
• Total sales on a rolling 12 month basis increased by 2.5% to $582 per square foot.
• Occupancy improved by 80 basis points to 96.1%.
• The releasing spread for the rolling 12 months was
$8.94 per square foot — rent for spaces leased in 2013 was 16.8% higher than prior rent paid for the same spaces.

  2013 ANNUAL REPORT

2013 NEW INVESTMENTS
We have a strong investment track record of making smart, accretive, value-enhancing acquisitions to diversify and increase the quality of our portfolio, which takes advantage of our scale, and allows us to enter new markets. In 2013 we invested approximately $1.05 billion in strategic acquisitions and joint ventures, enhancing our domestic footprint and extending our international asset base on an accretive basis.
McArthurGlen
In June 2013, we announced a joint venture with the McArthurGlen Group, the leader in upscale European designer outlets, for an investment of approximately
$500 million. We are excited about this partnership and its contribution to the global footprint of our Premium Outlet portfolio. Europe, now combined with North America and Asia, gives us an unparalleled global platform for our retailers and consumers in the outlet sector. We are also pleased
to expand our interests within the European market, which we believe has positive long-term growth prospects for high-quality retail real estate and where we have entered
at a cyclical trough. With all elements of the joint venture transaction closed in October, we now have an ownership interest in six assets, including five existing designer outlet properties located in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as well as one property under construction in Vancouver, Canada expected to open in spring 2015.
We have also become an equal partner in McArthurGlen’s property management and development company, which benefits from an established pipeline of future expansion and new development opportunities.
Other positive changes to our property portfolio in 2013 include the acquisition of Woodburn Premium Outlets, a productive 390,000 square foot center located near Portland, Oregon, that is a strong addition to our Premium Outlets business. We also disposed of our interests in 14 non-core retail assets during the year, showing our commitment to active management of our property portfolio in order to recycle capital and prioritize management’s focus.
Klépierre
Our 2012 investment in Klépierre continues to grow in value with the company’s progress in redirecting its strategy and its continued solid performance. As Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I am pleased that operating efficiency has improved and the repositioning of their property portfolio through divestment of office properties and smaller retail centers
has accelerated. While retail sales in its key markets were flat through 2013, the business has stabilized and Klépierre is positioned for growth.
The market has responded positively to Klépierre’s new strategic direction, as well as its execution since we made our investment. We bought our Klépierre stake at €28.00 per share and the stock closed at €33.68 on December 31. Including dividends and currency impact, we have realized a 37% return on our investment in the first 21 months of ownership.
2013 OPENINGS
New Development
In 2013, we opened a record number of five new Premium Outlets in North America and Asia, a positive reflection of the growth opportunity, capacity and reach of the Premium Outlets platform.
In Japan, Shisui Premium Outlets opened to visitors in April. The first phase of this project, located near Tokyo’s Narita International Airport, has 120 stores in 235,000 square feet and features a mix of international and Japanese brands, as well as restaurants with an expansion of 131,000 square feet about to commence. Our third center in Korea, Busan Premium Outlets, opened in August. The property features 180 stores and 360,000 square feet of retail space and is located just north of Busan, the country’s second largest city, on the Korean Peninsula.
In North America, Phoenix Premium Outlets, located in Chandler, Arizona adjacent to the Wild Horse Pass Hotel
& Casino, opened its first phase in April with 90 stores in 356,000 square feet. Toronto Premium Outlets, Canada’s first Premium Outlet Center, opened in August with 90 stores in 358,000 square feet. Also in August, we opened St. Louis Premium Outlets, with 90 stores in 351,000 square feet serving the greater St. Louis area.
A busy but very satisfying year for us on the new development front and happily all are performing above our expectations.
Redevelopment
We continue to invest in many of our top properties to meet consumer demand for more popular brands, dining and entertainment experiences.
Malls: Notable mall projects include a complete redevelopment for the New York metropolitan area and Northern New Jersey area with The Shops at Nanuet, a 750,000 square foot open-air, state-of-the-art main street center providing customers with shopping, entertainment, dining and fitness opportunities.
The Shops demonstrate our ability to redevelop a troubled shopping center into a vibrant and exciting destination on an accretive basis. We also opened a variety of dining establishments as part of the redevelopment of Walt Whitman Shops, which opened in November and included the addition of 74,000 square feet of exterior-facing shops.

    DADELAND MALL, MIAMI, FL
Significant redevelopment projects were started in 2013 at
a number of our top properties. An expansion at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York will accommodate the addition of Neiman Marcus and a number of other luxury retailers and upscale restaurants; the redevelopment of Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance, California, will add Nordstrom and provide a more upscale environment for this well-located property, starting with a collection of patio cafes opened early in 2014. At Houston Galleria, Saks will relocate with a new flagship format to open in 2016, with other luxury retailer additions to follow. We expect these initiatives and other similar projects to further enhance the productivity and appeal of our centers in major markets and tourist destinations.
Premium Outlets: Multiple expansions were completed within the Premium Outlets global portfolio. In Korea, a 96,000 square foot expansion of Paju Premium Outlets opened in May. In Seattle, more than 100,000 square feet of additional retail space were completed in June. Late in 2013, the expansion of Orlando Premium Outlets-Vineland Ave was completed, adding 105,000 square feet of retail space.
The second phase of Johor Premium Outlets in Malaysia was also completed, adding 40 new stores and 90,000 square feet to meet demand for this popular center near Singapore, attracting visitors from around the region. An expansion of Desert Hills Premium Outlets was in progress throughout 2013, and is opening on April 24th of this year. We also began a multi-year redevelopment of the iconic Woodbury Common Premium Outlets that expands the available retail space, provides a new upgraded dining pavilion, adds more parking and reorganizes the center into five unique districts
TORONTO PREMIUM OUTLETS, ONTARIO, CANADA
that correspond to popular New York tourist destinations such as the Adirondacks and the Hamptons. Expansion is also underway at Las Vegas Premium Outlets-North, a leading tourist destination for luxury outlet shopping. Very busy indeed.
The Mills: We continued to enhance The Mills portfolio through redevelopment projects and expansions, such as the addition of Macy’s to Gurnee Mills in Gurnee (Chicago), Illinois and the expansion of Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise (Miami), Florida, including an addition of 36,000 square feet to The Colonnade — the luxury outdoor component of the leading shopping center in Florida.
At the end of 2013, we had redevelopment and expansion projects underway at 25 properties in the U.S., Asia and Mexico at a cost of approximately $1.1 billion and expect this rate of activity to continue for the next few years. As this pipeline is brought on it will continue to fuel our growth.
2013 BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITY
Balance sheet management is a fundamental strength of our company. We continue to have the strongest balance sheet in the industry and access to capital that allows us to pursue our growth strategy. We have the highest investment grade ratings among U.S. retail real estate companies, and we remain one of only two U.S. REITs with “A” ratings from Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s.
We successfully executed our first euro-denominated debt offering of €750 million of seven-year senior unsecured notes at 2.375%. Not only did this open another source of capital
to us, but it also provides a natural hedge to our European

investment. We were also active in the secured debt markets throughout the year, and closed or locked rates on 30 new mortgages totaling approximately $5.0 billion, of which our share is $3.0 billion. The weighted average interest rate on these new loans is 3.31%, and the weighted average term is 7.5 years.
We have reduced the weighted average interest rate of our debt from 5.46% at the end of 2009 to 4.78% at the end of 2013. Over this same period of time, the weighted average years
to maturity was extended from 4.2 years to 5.5 years. Our refinancing plans will continue to be aggressive, and we are confident in our ability to continue to lower our cost of capital.
2014 FOCUS
As we continue to set the bar higher as property owners and stewards of capital, we remain laser-focused on optimizing results across our global portfolio. In 2014, this will include our planned spin-off of the strip center business and smaller
enclosed malls into an independent, publicly-traded REIT. Washington Prime Group (“WPG”) will be led by Mark Ordan as CEO who has a terrific track record of creating shareholder value. We believe this will create a retail real estate company poised to capitalize on its unique growth opportunities while allowing SPG to focus on its global portfolio of larger malls, Premium Outlets and Mills. The spin-off will focus on many of the principles that made SPG what it is today including cash flow growth and increasing returns on equity. As a future shareholder and director of WPG, I expect the company to prosper. Rick Sokolov, as Chairman of WPG, and I will ensure a smooth and successful transition. Within the SPG portfolio, we will continue to invest in new development, redevelopment and expansion projects that meet our return expectations and will generate future growth.
New Development
In 2014, we expect three new properties to be completed in North America: Charlotte Premium Outlets in Charlotte, North Carolina, Twin Cities Premium Outlets in Eagan (Minneapolis- St. Paul), Minnesota and Montreal Premium Outlets in Mirabel (Montreal), Quebec, Canada. All three of these properties are addressing unmet consumer demand for top brands at value pricing in dynamic, growing markets. We will also continue to pursue selective new development opportunities within our Premium Outlet pipeline in the U.S. and abroad.
Redevelopment and Expansion
Our commitment to investing to enhance our top properties remains unabated. Our redevelopment pipeline remains robust across all of our property platforms, and competition for capital at SPG is decided in favor of meeting our expected return hurdles and strategic advancements of our properties.

2013 ANNUAL REPORT

Branding
In the second half of last year, we started a rebranding project that will go live during the second quarter of 2014. Our aim is to create a truly world class brand for Simon that evokes the high quality of our retail real estate. We believe a strong brand will enhance our competitive advantage and create opportunities to engage directly with our consumers. The new brand approach will create a unified presence across all of our platforms that promotes fashion, discovery and community — key elements defining who we are as a company. This report provides a glimpse of our new look and feel. We will launch with a coordinated multimedia campaign across major fashion publications and through our corporate website and digital marketing mediums.
Focus on the Consumer
Visiting the mall is becoming more than just a shopping experience. Malls are increasingly a destination for family
and friends, for entertainment and for community, and we
are pushing ourselves on how we deliver this comprehensive experience to meet the evolving needs of our customers. You see it in the significant upgrades to our dining experiences including the addition of healthy choices. It is reflected in the growth of quality children’s play areas, new areas of soft seating, charging stations, Wi-Fi, and other must-have conveniences. We are increasing our emphasis on the level of service and engagement with our consumers, and providing new ways
to make their shopping more enjoyable, convenient, and efficient — whatever their needs may be. Continual product improvement is a vital attribute for all successful companies. We are no different. This will always be a priority for us.
All Things Digital
Contrary to a belief held by some, malls are not becoming obsolete. If anything, they are becoming more fully integrated into our communities by serving the multiple needs of our consumers whether they are shopping, dining, exercising,
or going to be entertained. While online buying presents a competitive option to our retailers’ stores, that very same technology is complementary to our business with more and more retailers incorporating it as an integral part of their in-store customer experience. We are also actively supporting our centers through multiple forms of digital engagement with the consumer, ranging from providing directions through the Simon Malls smartphone app, to frequent social media interactions, to special offers direct to consumers through our online retailer showcase, to investments in emerging technologies and services such as Deliv, a same-day delivery service that leverages the mall’s proximity to its customer base, or Jifiti, an application that makes gifting easier. Our experimentation in this area will continue, and will result in a better experience through the creation of “the mall of the future.”
DIVIDENDS
Our policy in 2013 and in the future is to pay dividends to our stockholders equal to taxable income. Given our expected growth in taxable income, we expect to continue to grow our dividends. As I mentioned before, common stock dividends paid in 2013 were $4.65 per share, an increase of 13.4% from 2012, and we expect to distribute at least $5.00 per share
in 2014, not including dividends expected to be paid by our spin-off company, WPG.
OUR STRATEGY
Early on, we developed a long-term strategy which continues to serve us and our stockholders well:
• Focus on the ownership of high-quality retail real estate
• Increase our presence in major metropolitan markets
• Own assets along the price spectrum of retail real estate
• Lead the industry in successful and profitable acquisitions
• Lead the industry in promoting the “Mall as a Marketing Medium” and connecting with our community and consumer
• Export our “know how” internationally
We remain committed to this strategy as the best path to achieving continued business success and consistently strong financial performance, but we are flexible if the environment requires change.
I look forward to another excellent year in 2014. With the hard work of my colleagues at Simon Property Group we anticipate continuing to deliver the kind of results you, our stockholders, have come to expect from us. I also want to thank our Board for their service, duty and loyalty, and our stockholders for your continued support. Please take the time to visit any of our properties (and shop!) and, as always, I welcome your comments and feedback.
