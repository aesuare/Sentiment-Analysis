Dear Shareholder

 gainst a backdrop of U.S. government gridlock, persistently high unemployment rates at home, political and economic crises around the globe, and dramatic volatility in the capital markets, we produced solid improvement in nearly all key metrics in FY 2011. Although U.S. housing starts remained down 60% from historical norms, we took important steps forward in FY 2011. We reported net income of $39.8 million, or $0.24 per share diluted, for FY 2011, compared to a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.02 per share diluted, for FY 2010. FY 2011's fourth quarter was our second consecutive quarter of pre-tax profitability and our sixth consecutive quarter of pre-tax, preimpairment profitability. Our pre-impairment home building gross margin improved nearly 250 basis points in FY 2011 compared to FY 2010, and it improved in each of the FY 2011's four quarters compared to the prior year's same periods. While FY 2011's revenues were down 1% compared to FY 2010, the value of our FY 2011 contracts and backlog were up 9% and 15%, respectively. For FY 2011, we reported a pre-tax loss of $29.4 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $117.2 million for FY 2010. FY 2011's inventory and joint venture write-downs totaled $92.7 million, compared to $115.3 million of inventory and write-downs in FY 2010, and charges related to early retirement of debt in FY 2011 totaled $3.8 million, compared to $1.2 million in FY 2010. Excluding inventory and joint venture writedowns and early debt retirement charges, FY 2011's pre-tax income was $67.2 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $0.7 million in FY 2010. FY 2011 included a net tax benefit of $69.2 million, compared to a net tax benefit of $113.8 million in FY 2010. FY 2011 home building revenues of $1.48 billion and 2,611 units declined 1% in both dollars and units, and FY 2011 net signed contracts of $1.60 billion and 2,784 units increased 9% in dollars and 7% in units, compared to FY 2010. FY 2011's contract cancellation rate* was 6.1%, which was consistent with our pre-downturn historical averages. We ended FY 2011 with a backlog of $981.1 million and 1,667 units, an increase of 15% in dollars and 12% in units compared to FY 2010's year-end backlog. Our solid liquidity provides significant financial flexibility as we position ourselves for a recovery. We ended FY 2011 with a net debt-to-capital ratio** of 15.0% and

$1.14 billion of cash and marketable securities. At FYE 2011, we also had $785 million available under our $885 million 12-bank credit facility, which matures in October 2014. As of this writing, in FY 2012's first quarter, we have deployed approximately $235 million more in cash: $143.7 million for the purchase of the builder CamWest Development LLC in Seattle and the remainder for land acquisitions and other corporate purposes. Our strong balance sheet enables us to invest in growing our business for the future. During FY 2011, we spent approximately $281 million on land for our core traditional and urban new home business, purchasing approximately 3,400 home sites and optioning another 5,800: This resulted in a net increase to 37,500 lots owned or optioned at FYE 2011 versus 34,900 at FYE 2010. Nearly 60% of our lots are concentrated in the land-constrained metro Washington, D.C., to Boston corridor, which enjoys lower unemployment and greater affluence than many other regions. In mid-November, two weeks after our FY 2011 ended, we announced our entry into the Seattle market with the acquisition of CamWest, one of the premier home building companies in the Pacific Northwest. We are impressed with the vitality of the Seattle market, its high barriers to entry, robust employment base, and concentration of affluence. This purchase involved the acquisition of 1,245 home sites with another 254 home sites under option. It will immediately increase our selling community total by 15 as we begin FY 2012 and will add to community growth in the future.

The urban metro New York City market remains a bright light for us. In FY 2011, we opened three new buildings under ourToll Brothers City Living® brand. We launched 1450 Washington, the fourth building in our successful Hudson Tea project at the northern tip of Hoboken, NJ. In Manhattan, we opened The Touraine at 65th Street and Lexington Avenue on the Upper East Side, a small boutique building with an average projected sales price of $5 million per unit. On the Brooklyn waterfront, we introduced 205 Water in the DUMBO neighborhood. Before opening for sale, The Touraine and 205 Water each had lists of over 3,000 prospects who had expressed interest. In total in the urban metro New York City market, we have completed 13 buildings of approximately 2,550 units, approximately 2,430 of which have been sold; we are in construction on three buildings of 245 units with eight more buildings of approximately 1,600 units in planning. We ended FY 2011 with 215 selling communities, compared to 195 at FYE 2010. During FY 2012, with the addition of Seattle, we project growing our community count by between 9% and 19% and reaching FYE 2012 with between 235 and 255 selling communities. Based on our FYE 2011 backlog and our current community count, we presently estimate that we will deliver between 2,400 and 3,200 homes in FY 2012 at an average price of between $550,000 and $575,000 per home. We believe that earnings growth can come from increasing our community count, but that significant margin improvement will only be achieved once we see the return of some urgency to the market, which should lead to increased sales prices and paces. Gibraltar Capital and Asset Management, LLC ("Gibraltar"), our wholly owned subsidiary formed to purchase distressed loans and assets, completed four transactions in FY 2011. The transactions involved the purchase of interest in 121 non-performing loans, the combined outstanding balance of which was approximately $272 million. With Gibraltar's specialized skills in the valuation and management of distressed real estate development assets, we have now completed transactions totaling approximately

$2.0 billion of non-performing loans and real estate assets in partnerships and on our own. We currently have approximately $100 million invested in Gibraltar and continue to seek opportunities to leverage Gibraltar's strengths with Toll Brothers' expertise, relationships, well-known brand name, nationwide presence, and capital.  We believe that strengthening the housing market is key to an economic recovery. It will reduce unemployment, which will improve consumer confidence and bring on more demand. Unemployment nationally among college graduates is well below 5%. We, therefore, believe that our customers have the ability to buy. They are aware of the tremendous affordability of homes and the record low interest rates. However, a lack of confidence in the direction of the economy is perhaps the biggest impediment to unleashing what we believe is significant pent-up demand. The most recent National Association of Realtors® Housing Affordability Index is at an all-time high dating back to 1971, which indicates that we could have an acceleration in demand with just a modest increase in confidence. As we look to the future, we believe we are well positioned. Our national brand name as "America's Luxury Home Builder," the breadth of products we offer, and the geographic diversity of the markets in which we operate afford us significant opportunities for growth. Our financial strength, which ranks us among the top two credit-rated U.S. home building companies, provides us with a competitive advantage in accessing capital and closing deals with sellers. And our solid land position and limited competition in the upscale market should give us a head start as markets recover. We thank our suppliers, contractors, banks, and bondholders for their commitment to our Company; our shareholders for their tremendous support; our customers for their trust in us; and our employees for their expertise, diligence, and devotion to providing our home buyers with the superior service, quality, and value that are the foundation of our reputation.
