Kent Kresa Chairman of the Board Dean A. Scarborough President and Chief Executive Officer

DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
WE ARE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT 2006 WAS ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR FOR AVERY DENNISON. WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING OUR VISION OF BEING RECOGNIZED AS THE BEST COATING AND CONVERTING COMPANY IN THE WORLD BY HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS GROW THEIR BUSINESSES. We continued to expand our presence in emerging markets, where high demand for our products drove significant growth. We began to regain some market share in our North American pressure-sensitive materials business in the second half of the year, although soft market demand negatively impacted our revenue growth. Sales of our high-margin printable media products in the Office and Consumer Products segment grew in 2006, as a direct result of increased marketing and product renovation programs. This is a solid improvement from the slow decline we experienced in the previous year. Our Retail Information Services (RIS) business also delivered solid top-line growth from new products such as heat transfer, as well as solid expansion in Asia. We undertook a major business realignment in 2006 that spanned all geographies and businesses with the goal of simplifying processes and improving efficiencies. We met our objectives, achieving close to $100 million of annualized savings, while reshaping our organizations to be more responsive to customers. We were pleased with the conclusion of the investigations by the Department of Justice and the European Commission into competitive practices in the label stock industry. Both of these investigations were closed with no action.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

­ Reported sales from continuing operations grew 2 percent to $5.6 billion in 2006 ­ Net income from continuing operations grew 21 percent to $352.5 million in 2006

AVERY DENNISON 2006

MOVING FORWARD

Last year set the foundation for our Company to focus more on top-line growth, as well as executing our margin improvement programs. WE UNDERTOOK A MAJOR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT IN 2006 THAT SPANNED ALL GEOGRAPHIES AND BUSINESSES WITH THE GOAL OF SIMPLIFYING PROCESSES AND IMPROVING EFFICIENCIES. We continue to invest aggressively in emerging markets. The developing economies of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe represent approximately 25 percent of our sales, which have grown in the midteens. In 2007, we will open several new facilities in China and India. Growth is accelerating in India, where we will add facilities for both Retail Information Services and Pressure-sensitive Materials. Every Avery Dennison business will have a footprint in India by the end of the year. In addition, we recently opened the Philip M. Neal Asia Pacific Research Center in China. This stateof-the-art facility is focused on helping our customers grow even faster in this region.

We added to our RFID capability with the purchase of an important technology to produce customized RFID products in smaller volumes. RFID sales began to increase in the fourth quarter of 2006. We will continue our investment program, expanding our geographic reach and our new products capability in this promising new market. Our channel access and manufacturing platforms are strong advantages in this market. Retail Information Services is poised to deliver solid growth. RIS has benefited from strategic competitive advantages, including fulfillment and consistency of brand image and data for retailers and branded apparel manufacturers. We will add new facilities in Asia and introduce several new products for interior labeling. WE CONTINUE TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY IN EMERGING MARKETS... EVERY AVERY DENNISON BUSINESS WILL HAVE A FOOTPRINT IN INDIA BY THE END OF THE YEAR.

We are investing in a new clear-on-clear coating line in our Pressure-sensitive Materials business to support the rapidly growing demand for clear filmbased beer labels. Our share gain program is set to deliver moderate top-line growth in pressure-sensitive materials during 2007. Our service and new product platforms are enhanced by scale as we leverage our market-leading share position. Our Specialty Tape business is introducing many new product platforms, ranging from new elastic side panels for disposable diapers to new materials that adhere to low-surface-energy substrates and products that minimize noise and vibrations. These platforms were developed under our successful Horizons growth program -- most of these innovations produced in our Avery Research Center.

CONTINUED MARGIN EXPANSION

We will continue to create a number of programs to reach our long-term goal of an 11 percent operating margin. Our Enterprise Lean Sigma initiative is at the core of our efforts, as employees continually find ways to simplify and streamline processes, while improving quality and service for our customers. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we announced another round of productivity measures to deliver $11 million to $13 million in savings in 2008. OUR SERVICE AND NEW PRODUCT PLATFORMS ARE ENHANCED BY SCALE AS WE LEVERAGE OUR MARKET-LEADING SHARE POSITION.
LOOKING AHEAD WITH CONFIDENCE

As a $5.6 billion global company, Avery Dennison is an industry leader with clear competitive advantages in developed and emerging markets. Our strengths include: global scale; a strong share position for our core roll materials business; a strong Avery brand and consumer awareness in the office supply category; and an advantageous position in the Retail Information Services business. Our service and delivery platforms,

coupled with our size and worldwide reach, make us the fastest provider of innovative products in our relevant markets. We have an experienced team of leaders who are guided by our vision, values and operating principles. With more than half of our top senior management team born outside the U.S., we know how to operate in the 49 countries in which we do business. Knowing how to operate locally, while leveraging our worldwide values and resources, is a key advantage for us in markets outside the U.S. The year 2007 marks the 100th birthday of the Company's founder, R. Stanton Avery. From the inception of Avery Dennison in 1935, Stan emphasized the importance of providing innovative products and services, and operating our business in an honest and forthright manner. Those of us who had the privilege of working with Stan know how much emphasis he placed on being a good corporate citizen and an excellent employer. Avery Dennison has implemented a number of programs to help employees understand the importance of the values and vision that guide all of us in this Company.

To our shareholders, we appreciate your support of the Company over the past year. To our employees, we offer our deepest thanks for your hard work in demonstrating the Avery Dennison difference through a year of change, renewal and progress. Sincerely,

DEAN A. SCARBOROUGH President and Chief Executive Officer
