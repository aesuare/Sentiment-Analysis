  “We consistently work to deliver more value for our stakeholders through innovation, capacity additions, market expansion, portfolio management and margin improvement.“
Patrick Prevost
Dear fellow shareholders,
In 2014, Cabot continued its legacy of delivering innovation, and we made significant progress in meeting our ongoing commitments to our customers, employees and investors. Our global team focused on advancing our business performance, engaging with our customers to deliver powerful solutions and creating value for our shareholders. Cabot is made up of talented and engaged people who provide exceptional product development, innovation and customer service. Our people, along with our trusted brand and products, differentiate us in the market.
During the past year, we continued to see uncertain global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. These conditions brought about some challenges that
we are accustomed to overcoming. Our global leadership in specialty chemicals and performance materials demands that we perform well under any market conditions. Our commitment to you has always been to operate our business in a way that allows us to deliver value in the short-term, while preparing for long-term growth. We consistently work to deliver more value for our stakeholders through innovation, capacity additions, market expansion, portfolio management and margin improvement.
PROMOTING RESPONSIBILITY Our strong commitment to safety, health and environmental performance was again visible in 2014. As one of our Cabot values, we take responsibility seriously and interpret it broadly. We hold ourselves accountable in this area because nothing is more important than the safety and health of our employees, visitors, partners, customers and communities.
By acting responsibly and promoting safety and environmental excellence throughout our organization, we have maintained our leadership position among global chemical manufacturing companies with a world-class total recordable incident rate (TRIR) of .51 across our operations. While this rate is higher than a year ago, we are still maintaining strong performance across the company. More than two-thirds of our facilities went longer than one year without experiencing a recordable injury. We also reduced our injury severity rate for the fifth straight year, improving by 30% in total. Regarding our environmental performance, we further reduced our environmental non-conformances (ENCs) within legacy Cabot businesses (a total of 12, down from 16 in 2013), as well as Purification Solutions (a 35% decrease from 2013).

Cabot Corporation 2014 Annual Report
We are committed to developing methods and implementing processes to more efficiently use natural resources and reduce our impact on the environment. We made significant progress toward our corporate goals. Specifically, we achieved more than 40% of our target to reduce energy intensity by 10% by 2020 with a base–year reference of 2005.
We remain focused on minimizing our environmental footprint while maximizing our positive impact—helping to solve some of the world’s toughest challenges in the infrastructure, transportation, environment and consumer industries.
Our teams are working hard to implement processes and deliver products that contribute to sustainability.
DELIVERING ON OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS Once again, we clearly demonstrated what it means to be a leader in our industry. Thanks to outstanding operational execution by our teams, we generated $3.43 in adjusted earnings per share (EPS), which is 17% more than the previous year.
In addition, we achieved $593 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted EBITDA)—which is a record for the company, and the fifth consecutive year we have increased our adjusted EBITDA levels. Our strong performance was the result of record-setting earnings by our Reinforcement Materials and Performance Materials segments, as well as the royalties we generated in our Elastomer Composites business.
In addition to our robust earnings and EBITDA performance, we generated strong cash flows that were used to return cash to our shareholders and reduce our debt level. We increased our dividend by 10%, completed $11 million of share repurchases, and reduced our debt by $226 million. These actions were made possible through the $315 million of cash we generated from our operations, a strong focus on working capital, and the final cash payment
of $215 million that we collected from the sale of our tantalum business. Our team’s focus on net working capital throughout the past 12 months was also an important contributing factor.

INVESTING IN THE FUTURE Expanding our global operational capabilities is a strategic imperative for us. Strong contributors to our record-setting performance in Reinforcement Materials were the result of the successful commercialization of our new plant in Xingtai, China and the acquisition of our joint venture partner’s share of our carbon black plant in Mexico. In addition, strategic portfolio oversight led to the divestiture of our Security Materials business this year for $20 million. Finally, we began the transition of our Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) business service center from Leuven, Belgium to Riga, Latvia to improve our efficiency and effectiveness.
Our Purification Solutions business made solid progress in 2014 as we prepare for the future. We have made headway in stabilizing the operations of the business as a result of our investment in manufacturing excellence. We completed the development of a new lignite mine to assure that we will have a dependable and long-term supply of high-quality raw materials to serve the anticipated growth in demand from coal-fired utilities in North America. Coupled with numerous North American power utility contract wins, I am confident that we will continue to see positive momentum in 2015.
ADVANCING INNOVATION Innovation is essential to advancing our industry leadership, and we developed a number of new high-performance products across our portfolio in 2014. For this to happen, we have to constantly improve our understanding of our customers’ needs, their industries and the global trends that impact them. This knowledge, combined with our global expertise, enables us to not only develop, but deliver powerful solutions that help our customers be successful in their markets.
In 2014, we prioritized our research and development projects based on their adjacencies to our current product lines and process capabilities. This focused approach enabled faster delivery of new products to the market.

  Cabot Corporation 2014 Annual Report
As such, we launched a number of new products, including fumed silica for adhesives, carbon additives for batteries, reinforcing materials for tire tread applications, specialty carbons and fumed silica additives for toners, as well as activated carbon for both sugar decolorization and oil and gas applications. This pipeline of new products is a testament to our innovation and technology capabilities and is essential to our strategy of leadership in our various businesses.
Our research and development team is also collaborating with industry and academia to find new ways to apply our technical capabilities in areas such as graphene and 3D printing, both
of which will go a long way toward enabling innovation in the markets we serve. Specifically, we have made progress in graphene production technology and applications. We have also integrated our graphene applications knowledge with other core carbon technologies such as surface modification. A number of leading companies have engaged in development programs with us to evaluate how our graphene materials can solve critical challenges in energy storage, polymer composites and specialty elastomers. We are very pleased with our progress and enthusiastic about the benefits these new materials can bring.
Innovation is the lifeblood of Cabot and has been for nearly 140 years. We are excited to apply our technical skills in ways that benefit our customers and improve the world around us.
A YEAR OF VALUE Overall, when I look back on this past year, I am proud of our team’s accomplishments and thank them for their contributions to our success. Our investments
and achievements in 2014 position us well for the coming year and have set us up for an even brighter future. Cabot is an undisputable leader in the markets it serves. Our focus on continuing to improve our competitive position is what results in creating value for all of our stakeholders.
I would specifically like to thank our shareholders for their continued support as we engage in the challenges of the coming year. Our constant pursuit of superior performance is what drives all of us every day.
Regards,
Patrick Prevost
