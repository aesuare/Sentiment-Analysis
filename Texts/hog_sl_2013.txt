2013 Annual Review

CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS

2013 was a big year for Harley-Davidson.
From the introduction of our game-changing Project RUSHMORE motorcycles and reveal of the Harley-Davidson StreetTM 750 and 500, to our continued global expansion, the launch of flexible surge production, our 110th ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, the rollout of our new eCommerce site and  more, the year was full of milestones and momentum. Our entire team has been relentless at driving improvements throughout the organization that enable us­as a customer-led company­to design, build and deliver motorcycles with unprecedented speed, efficiency, safety and quality. Together with our dealers, we continued to broaden our customer base globally and inspire both longtime and new riders to experience our brand. KEITH WANDELL,

Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, HarleyDavidson, Inc., shares his thoughts on 2013's company milestones.

In 2013, these efforts again translated into growth in sales, financial performance and shareholder value. · Net income climbed 17.6 percent on consolidated revenue  growth of 5.7 percent. · Earnings per share increased 20.6 percent compared to 2012. · The global network of Harley-Davidson dealers sold 260,839 new Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a 4.4 percent increase, with continued improvement internationally and among both core and outreach  customers in the U.S.

NEW HARLEY-DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLES

CUSTOMER-LED MOTORCYCLES With the biggest launch of new motorcycle models in Harley-Davidson's history, 2013 was a breakout year for new products. The PROJECT RUSHMORE motorcycles are the first to come through our new, world-class product development pipeline and introduce major innovation and design improvements. They were developed with a level of consumer input that brought the voice of the customer to product design in an unparalleled  way for us.  The eight models in the RUSHMORE lineup were enthusiastically embraced right out of the gate by riders in the U.S. and internationally, and by core and outreach customers. In the first 45 days at retail, the RUSHMORE motorcycles sparked the largest year-over-year new model year sales increase in two decades.

CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

On the heels of Rushmore, we revealed the Street 750 and Street 500 to great enthusiasm. In developing these motorcycles, we interviewed more than 3,000 consumers and dealers in more than 10 countries to understand what they're looking for in a Harley-Davidson motorcycle. The Street 750 and Street 500 turn those insights into motorcycles designed for the lifestyle and riding needs of a growing generation of urban young adults globally. Harley-Davidson Street hits the showroom floor this spring and summer in select markets.  As we look down the road, there's a lot more to come­incredible new motorcycles that are in our product development pipeline.

FLEXIBLE, RESPONSIVE MANUFACTURING Flexible manufacturing hit the ground running at Harley-Davidson in 2013. With the nearly seamless launch of surge production at our York, Pa. plant early in the year, we were able to ramp up production heading into spring and build motorcycles closer to seasonal sales patterns. We've gained tremendous flexibility to adjust more quickly to other market dynamics as well, better matching the production of our 30 models­in all their variations­to shifts in customer and geographic demand. And early this year we launched seasonal surge production at our Kansas City plant­another milestone as we continue to deliver the improvements in manufacturing flexibility that will increasingly enable us to get the right motorcycles to the right customers at the right time.

GROWING OUR REACH Together with our dealers, we continued to broaden our reach to new customers, even as we strengthened the bonds with longtime riders in 2013. We grew sales internationally, grew sales in the U.S., and within the U.S. grew sales both to core and outreach customers. Nearly 6 in 10 sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles globally were to customers outside our traditional U.S. base of Caucasian men ages 35-plus. In the U.S., retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles to U.S. outreach customers--who we define as young adults 18-34, women, African Americans and Hispanics--grew at more than twice the rate of sales growth to core customers in 2013.

CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

Last April, we reported that, for the fifth straight year, Harley-Davidson was the U.S. market share leader in new motorcycle sales to each of our outreach segments, across all sizes of on-street motorcycles. We expect to make it six years in a row when the new data comes out in April 2014. 
In Brazil, our largest Latin America market, we captured the market share lead in the 601cc and above category for the first time in 2013. Overall, retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles in Latin America were up more than 13 percent. In the 16-country Europe market, we grew our market share year over year and held the number two position in the highly competitive 601cc and up segment, despite a continued challenging economy in which Harley-Davidson new motorcycle sales volume decreased 3 percent. In EMEA outside the 16-country Europe market, retail new Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales grew 11.4 percent year over year. We had our highest level of new motorcycle sales ever in our Asia-Pacific markets, selling 26,890 motorcycles, up 9.8 percent from 2012 . We had particularly strong growth rates in emerging markets, including India and China, and again were the market share leader in the 601cc-plus category in both Japan and Australia.

GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES Our dealers already provide what we believe is the best customer experience in the power sports industry and we're working closely with the dealers to ensure this remains a competitive advantage for Harley-Davidson. Our goal is to be the best, period, regardless of industry, when it comes to providing a trusted, personal and social experience for customers at every touchpoint. We've put the tools, training and technology in place, in close partnership with our dealers, to constantly drive the evolution of that customer experience. In 2013, more than 5,000 dealership personnel in 255 stores took part in intensive, in-store learning on best practices for providing great customer experiences. In 2014, we will complete this training for the balance of the global dealer network.

When it comes to providing great customer experiences, Harley-Davidson Financial Services has been a longtime strategic advantage for Harley-Davidson in the U.S. and now, increasingly abroad. HDFS helps enable sales of HarleyDavidson motorcycles while providing an attractive return to the company and our shareholders. Outside North America, HDFS launched 12 new finance and insurance programs in 2013, and at year-end offered 68 finance and insurance programs in 26 countries in support of Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales for Latin America, Asia Pacific, and EMEA. In 2014, HDFS expects to continue to expand its program offerings and training to continue to improve the F&I experience our dealers provide to riders.
