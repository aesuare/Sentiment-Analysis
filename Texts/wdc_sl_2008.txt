FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
Fiscal 2008 was an outstanding year for Western Digital, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy and of our enhanced business model.
Customer satisfaction with WD’s broad product line, high quality and reliability, service excellence and overall value proposition continues to drive our business growth. Underpinning our value proposition is a business model based on a relentless focus on highly efficient operations, resulting in what we believe is the hard drive industry’s most competitive total cost structure.
In fiscal 2008 we delivered outstanding financial results, outpaced the growing global hard drive industry, established technology leadership in the 2.5-inch notebook and 3.5-inch desktop PC markets, and completed and integrated the largest acquisition
in company history. As a result, we entered fiscal 2009 well positioned to continue our profitable growth.
Our fiscal 2008 performance was noteworthy, including strong year-over-year growth by many key measures:
• Shipments of hard drives increased 38 percent, to 133 million, driven by significant growth in new markets.
• Revenue grew 48 percent, to $8.1 billion.
• Operating income increased 142 percent, to $1.0 billion, delivering on our stated goal of profitable growth.
• Earnings per share grew 54 percent, to $3.84, driving a significant increase in shareholder value.
• We increased our total capital and research and development spending by 71 percent, to $1.1 billion.
• We completed our $1 billion acquisition of Komag, a leading media supplier, resulting in WD being an even more vertically integrated player that can better scale into fast-growing markets. Our new media operation is already generating solid technology and cost contributions to the overall business.
• We finished the year with $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of over $400 million.

This is a great time to be in the growing global hard drive industry. Storage demand and applications for hard drives continue to proliferate in computing and consumer markets as both workplace and lifestyle changes generate massive volumes of data to be secured conveniently and cost effectively on hard drives.
• In fiscal 2008 the HDD market generated revenues in excess of $35 billion with 540 million hard drives shipped, while forecasted demand for fiscal 2009 exceeds 620 million units.
• On a unit basis, the overall hard drive market is looking at a five-year CAGR of approximately 13 percent, while those markets served by WD are forecast to grow in excess of 16 percent annually.
• The industry’s fastest growth opportunities continue to be in the notebook PC and branded product markets, areas of continued emphasis for WD.
While maintaining our focus on the high-volume desktop PC market, we remain committed to our multi-year diversification effort. As a result, hard drive revenues from non-desktop markets expanded to 56 percent of revenue in fiscal 2008, compared with 43 percent in fiscal 2007 and 29 percent in fiscal 2006. More specifically:
        $9,000 $8,000 $7,000 $6,000 $5,000 $4,000 $3,000 $2,000 $1,000

While maintaining our focus in the high-volume desktop market, we have made major strides in diversifying the business, by establishing our footprint in newer, faster-growth markets. As a result, we saw our hard drive revenue from non-desktop markets expand to 56% in fiscal 2008.

We tripled our 2.5-inch drive shipments, year-over-year, to 37 million units and with continued new product execution, we are well positioned for continued growth and market expansion in this space.
We increased sales of our branded products by 60 percent year-over-year to $1.4 billion and we continued to add new products and product features to the line up, to strengthen our leadership position in the external storage space and expand our available market.
PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE FROM BRANDED PRODUCTS*
In Enterprise SATA, a fast growing portion of the enterprise storage market, we continued to innovate with the introduction of our 3.5-inch WD RE2-GP SATA drives with GreenPowerTM technology and the WD VelociRaptorTM drive family, the industry’s first 300 gigabyte (GB) 10,000 RPM, 2.5-inch drive.
In CE, the introduction of our power-saving GreenPowerTM technology to our WD AV hard drives, combined with improved costs and our demonstrated field quality performance, led to enhanced value for our customers and improved contribution to WD’s business.

WD ended fiscal 2008 with $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of over $400 million from the prior year.
We have made and continue to make significant investments in
the technologies and infrastructure that will enhance our ability
to keep on diversifying the business and compete as a full-line industry leader. We will do so with the product portfolio required
to capitalize on the growth trends across all markets and with the capacity and cost structure to do so efficiently and profitably. There were several tangible examples of return on these investments in fiscal 2008:
• We achieved the industry-leading technology position in both 2.5-inch notebook and 3.5-inch desktop PC markets;
• Utilizing our GreenPowerTM technology, we launched a family of hard drives specifically designed to consume substantially less power than standard drives;
• We began shipping our new line of WD Scorpio® BlackTM
7200 RPM 2.5-inch SATA hard drives in capacities up to
320 GB for high-performance notebook computers, expanding our available market in the 2.5-inch sector; and
• We completed the rollout of the popular My PassportTM series of portable hard drives with a refreshed design in multiple colors and we began shipping many other new and next-generation branded products, addressing higher capacity points, Mac® users, solutions for data backup, and the growing recording capacity needs of digital video recorder (DVR) users.
We have also added to our design and development capabilities with significant expansion of our technical workforce in Lake Forest, San Jose, and Asia, the addition of a new design center
in Longmont, Colorado, and the acquisition of the hard drive controller intellectual property rights, design tools and design team from STMicroelectronics. This in-house hard drive controller capability will enhance the efficiencies of our development process with close engagement from industry system-on-chip and channel suppliers. Our previously announced plan to upgrade and expand our Fremont wafer facility is on track and we have already produced the first wafers from our new 8-inch pilot line, ahead of schedule.
We are pleased with WD’s continued profitable growth and we remain focused on a strategy to build a company that will thrive
in the very attractive storage industry in the years to come. We
are confident in our ability to continue competing successfully
and we look forward to applying WD’s operational excellence, disciplined business model and the WD team values of passion, action, productivity, perseverance, innovation, and integrity in order to drive continued profitable growth for WD and to create value for our shareholders.
