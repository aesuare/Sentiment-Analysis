 TO OUR UNITHOLDERS
Fellow Partners:
During 2013, we returned more than $200 million in cash distributions to our unitholders, an increase of 52% from 2012. Although our full-year financial performance was impacted by a combination of planned maintenance at several large refineries, environmental compliance costs and a return to more normalized fuels refining margins, we made significant progress in further establishing Calumet as a leader in the specialty products and fuels manufacturing industries.
Our growth strategy, which emphasizes balanced investment in both complementary acquisitions and organic growth, was on display throughout the year, as we completed the purchase of a fuels refinery and a global specialty products manufacturer, and announced the single-largest capital investment campaign in the history of the Partnership. Collectively, these and related actions brought us several steps closer toward becoming a vertically integrated downstream energy company that remains well positioned for profitable growth in the years to come.
Vertical integration is central to the long-term success of the Calumet business model. Through this model, we seek to secure the lowest possible cost for feedstocks used in our business, while maximizing our realized gross profit margin per barrel sold. In application, this model has led us to own and operate refineries located in
close proximity to major producing oil fields; by staying close to the producers, we improve our surety of supply while reducing our feedstock transportation costs. Similarly, on the sales side of the equation, we seek to optimize the direct sales of our products to customers globally, while seeking to limit potentially costly third-party marketing relationships that erode profit margins. By staying close to our customers, we can anticipate their needs with leading-edge formulations while remaining competitive on price.
By maximizing efficiencies throughout the supply chain, from the point of production through the point of sale, we facilitate collaboration among our feedstock sourcing, manufacturing and sales teams. This allows us to remain operationally nimble and use our scale and size to our advantage.
2013 in Review
During January, we acquired a 14,500 bpd fuels refinery in San Antonio, Texas, in keeping with our strategy to own and operate inland refineries with direct access to cost-advantaged sources of crude oil, such as that in the Eagle Ford shale formation, where the refinery sources all of its feedstock. This refinery, which produces principally gasoline and diesel fuel, is the third fuels refinery we have purchased in as many years. Consistent regional demand for light fuel products, coupled with access to a discounted supply of local crude oil, positions this refinery for profitable growth in the years ahead.
During March, we broke ground on a 20,000 bpd diesel fuel refinery in North Dakota with our joint venture partner, MDU Resources. When this refinery comes on-stream during the fourth quarter 2014, it will become a key producer and marketer of refined products in a region where cost-advantaged crude oil is plentiful and diesel fuel is in short supply. Equally important is the

fact that, like many of our refineries, it will source its crude oil from the prolific Bakken Shale formation, which straddles the border between North Dakota and Montana.
During June, we announced $500-550 million in high-return organic growth projects slated for completion between 2013 and 2016. Collectively, these projects have the potential to nearly double our full-year Adjusted EBITDA from 2013 levels.
Finally, in December, we acquired the Bel-Ray Company, a manufacturer and global marketer of high-performance synthetic lubricants and greases. We believe this very high-margin business, together with our Royal Purple and TruFuel branded products, have the potential to contribute meaningfully to the growth of our specialty products segment during the next three years.
At various points throughout the past year, we completed major turnarounds at our Superior, Montana and San Antonio refineries. With this maintenance behind us, each of these refineries should not require extended, multi-week plant outages until 2018. Understandably, our heavy turnaround schedule impacted distributable cash flow for the full year 2013. Fortunately, we anticipate no major planned outages at any of our major fuels refineries during 2014.
An unexpected headwind that impacted our full-year results involved higher-than-anticipated compliance costs related to the Renewable Fuels Standard (“RFS”). Under RFS, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) provides annual requirements for the total volume of renewable transportation fuels, including ethanol and advanced biofuels, which are mandated to be blended into the domestic gasoline pool. If a refiner does not meet its required annual Renewable Volume Obligation (“RVO”), the refiner can purchase blending credits in the open market to cover its obligation, referred to as RINs (“Renewable Identification Numbers”).
Beginning in July 2013, we witnessed a rapid escalation in RIN prices that contributed to a significant increase in RFS compliance costs versus the prior-year period. Despite the recent decline in RIN prices from record levels achieved during mid-2013, the Partnership continues to anticipate that expenses related to RFS compliance have the potential to remain a significant expense for Calumet and others in the refining industry. Calumet opposes the mandated use of alternative fuels and is working cooperatively with industry trade groups and our elected representatives to develop a new standard that is forward-thinking, environmentally conscious and takes into account the best interests of the U.S. consumer.
For the full year 2013, we paid total cash distributions of $2.74 per unit to our unitholders, versus $2.42 per unit in 2012. As a fixed-distribution master limited partnership, we support a mandate that seeks to maximize a steady stream of growing quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders. Since our initial public offering in 2006, Calumet has paid 32 consecutive quarters of cash distributions, with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 9%.
Given the substantial projected expenditures in the slate of organic growth projects during the next three years, we will continue to exercise disciplined capital management, while seeking to maintain acceptable leverage to support the growth of the Partnership. In keeping with our commitment to the fixed-distribution master limited partnership model, we realize the importance of mitigating commodity price risk through the use of derivative instruments.

we had entered into derivative instruments to hedge approximately half of our anticipated fuels production for the full year 2014.
With up to $385 million in total capital expenditures planned for 2014, we continue to operate the business in a manner that supports prudent balance sheet management. Exiting the year, Calumet had nearly $600 million in liquidity through cash on hand and availability under our revolver. We believe the capital markets remain available to us as we seek to grow the business, although we remain committed to lowering our cost of capital through subsequent financing events.
To that end, during November, we raised $350 million through a senior unsecured notes offering. The proceeds of this offering, net of more than $100 million we used to pay down higher coupon senior notes, have been allocated toward our investment in organic growth and acquisitions. The 7.625% coupon on the eight-year, $350 million tranche was almost 200 basis points better than what we were able to secure on our debut bond issue in 2011.
Safety-Focused Culture
Calumet has benefited from its continued investments in worker and process safety, where the Partnership continues to measure its performance on a systematic basis. Calumet is engaged in a multi-year corporate process safety initiative in which the Partnership reports plant-level safety metrics to the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) to benchmark its performance versus its
industry peers. Clearly, our
investments in worker and
process safety have yielded
positive results: Calumet
has nine locations that have
operated more than six years
without a lost-time injury, with
the Missouri manufacturing
facility approaching 16 years
without a lost-time injury. Moreover, during 2013 Calumet’s Princeton refinery exceeded 1.25 million hours worked without a lost-time injury – a testament to the continued training, preparation and diligence of our managers and operators.
Outlook for the Future
Looking ahead, our focus remains on several key areas: (1) Continue to maintain operational safety and plant reliability; (2) Focus on completing organic growth projects on schedule and on budget; (3) Continue to secure cost-advantaged crude oil and feedstocks for our refining system; (4) Continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and potential partnerships who facilitate vertical integration in both domestic and international markets; (5) Maintain conservative balance sheet management; and (6) Continue to manage the business in a way that supports a consistent, robust cash distribution.
Since we started Calumet nearly a quarter of a century ago, our Company has benefited from the loyalty and support of the communities in which our employees and many of our unitholders live and work. Even as we expand into new products, markets and geographies – and as we become recognized as a Fortune 500 company – we remain deeply thankful for the many individuals who have contributed to our past successes and promising future. We look forward to partnering with you in the years to come.
