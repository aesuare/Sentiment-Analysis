TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,
 2014 was a strong year for our company, marked by progress across
our organization. Along with solid financial performance, we realized the impact of our improving market position, as we advanced our strategic
priorities and our journey to build a world class property and
casualty company.
Over the last few years, we have focused our efforts on creating
a different kind of property and casualty company and one that consistently performs at a high level through the cycle. Our strategy is enabled by a unique value proposition for independent agents
and brokers, a broad and distinctive product set, a national operating model with strong, distributed underwriting expertise, and extensive market insight into business opportunities.
In 2014, all of the components of our strategy came together to accelerate our momentum, as we delivered on our financial goals, and set the stage for continued success.

2014 TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RE TURN
Delivering Strong and Improving Financial Results
In 2014, we generated net income of $282 million and operating income of $233 million for the year, resulting in a competitive operating return on shareholders’ equity of 9%. Our underlying performance was strong, as we increased operating income before taxes, excluding catastrophes2, by 18% year-over-year, to $629 million, underscoring the growing earnings power inherent in our organization.
We continued to improve our position in the market, growing premiums by approximately 6%, with solid momentum in each business. This level of growth is even more impressive given our work to reduce volatility and improve our business mix in the U.S., including actions to non-renew more than $400 million of premium associated with catastrophe concentrations and lower performing business over the last three years.
We generated solid and improving underwriting results in 2014. In line with our expectations, we delivered a 92% combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses3. This represents approximately
a two-point improvement over 2013, and a four-point improvement since 2012, placing us among the best in the industry.
Strong underwriting profits and improved earnings’ resiliency helped enhance our balance sheet and financial strength indicators during 2014. We closed the year with all financial measures at or better than targeted levels and with a book value of $64.85 per share, up 9% compared to 2013, and up 7% when net unrealized investment gains are excluded. In addition, our robust underlying earnings power was reflected in our board’s decision to increase the quarterly shareholder dividend by 11% this past December. In total, we paid $67 million
in shareholder dividends, which, along with our strong stock price appreciation, placed us among the top companies in the property and casualty industry for total shareholder return in 2014.
2 Pre-tax operating income, excluding catastrophes, is a non-GAAP measure. It is calculated by adding the impact of catastrophe losses of $223.0 million back into the pre-tax operating income of $406.2 million as indicated on page 48 of the enclosed Annual Report on the Form 10-K.
3 Combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, is a non-GAAP measure. The combined ratio (which includes catastrophe losses) is the closest GAAP measure. The reconciliation can be found on page 46 of the enclosed Annual Report on the Form 10-K.

 Improving Our Distinctive Market Position
In 2014, we continued to make progress on all of our strategic priorities:
• Strengthening our position with partner agents through a unique value proposition
• Building a broad and distinctive product portfolio
• Continuing to build and strengthen our national underwriting platform
Strengthening our position with partner agents through a unique value proposition
Our strategy is enabled by a differentiated distribution approach
that is made up of a selective network of partners with whom we have ’10
The Hanover Insurance Group
            established very strong relationships. Our value proposition of more exclusivity, and access to a broad and distinctive portfolio and a network of local underwriting expertise, put us in a position of strength with some of the best independent agents in the market.
In 2014, we made broad-based market share gains with our focus agents, growing 8-10% on average. Importantly, the number of products and coverages we wrote with them expanded significantly, as we gained a larger share of our partners’ customers with specialty- oriented needs. We also made important strides in penetrating their most desirable small commercial business. As these agents and brokers grow, organically or through acquisitions of other agents, we gain even greater access to business opportunities. Finally, we advanced even further the depth and quality of our planning process with our 2,200 agents.
Consistent and targeted interactions with our distributors give us insight into future opportunities, which are critical for partnership momentum.
Building a broad and distinctive product portfolio
We made great progress during the year in expanding our distinctive product portfolio. We continued to develop our Specialty businesses and our many tailored solutions for small and middle market customers, as well as our new Hanover Platinum account offering in Personal Lines.
Hanover Platinum bundles personal lines coverages and services for value-oriented customers. It is built on the success of our total account business philosophy that has been in place for many years. Account business represents 78% of our total policies in force, which is among

the highest in the industry. This approach allows us to gain access to customers who value higher levels of protection and service options. We believe Hanover Platinum is the best offering of its kind in the independent agent marketplace.
In Commercial Lines, we continued to implement innovative eldercare and medical facilities coverages to take advantage of opportunities in the rapidly growing healthcare sector. We also enhanced our technology offering for small and mid-sized businesses, strengthening our position in this dynamic market sector.
At the same time, we continued to build on our expertise in international markets. Through Chaucer, we broadened our specialty line capabilities, including casualty, where reception for our new U.S. casualty team
was very positive. We also advanced our expertise in certain marine classes. These, and other portfolio developments underway, are successfully increasing the range and number of promising underwriting opportunities available to us.
Continuing to build and strengthen our national underwriting platform
Among our most important strengths are our distributed operating model and our network of underwriting talent, which is closely aligned to our partners. With nearly half of our professionals working in our local offices — business insurance and specialty underwriters, sales and claims experts — we have the most locally focused team, with professionals working closely with our agents and customers.

2014 ANNUAL REPORT

 Over the last several years, we have assembled one of the best underwriting teams in the industry, building a robust national network of highly skilled professionals. The combination of strong talent and this distributed operating model allows us to provide responsive service and underwriting expertise to our partners. It also allows us to build important market insight through our focused and streamlined agency planning process. Through this approach, we match our capabilities to those of our partners, finding attractive business opportunities for both, and ensuring the successful execution of business plans, developed in collaboration with agents.
In 2014, we saw a steady increase in business opportunities and we increased our ability to proactively target the opportunities that create future profitable growth.
Looking ahead
We have achieved a great deal in recent years, building a very different kind of insurance company — one focused on helping our partners grow successful businesses by providing a strong and relevant product offering and the expertise of the best professionals in the industry. In 2014, we delivered strong financial results, and we advanced our strategic priorities, giving us even greater confidence in future earnings and growth momentum.
