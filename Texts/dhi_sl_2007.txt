Dear Fellow Shareholders:
Fiscal year 2007 was a challenging year for our company, D.R. Horton, Inc., America’s Builder. In the midst of a very soft U.S. housing environment marked by high inventories of new and existing homes, intense price competition, reduced mortgage financing availability and weak homebuyer confidence, we took a realistic approach in each of our markets and worked to maximize our performance and strengthen our financial position. Throughout the company, our employees redoubled their efforts to drive sales, reduce operating costs and improve our inventory positions, which allowed us to achieve the following results in fiscal 2007:
• $1.4 billion of positive cash flows generated from operations;
• $1.7 billion of consolidated debt reductions;
• $852 million of consolidated pre-tax profit, before asset impairments and land option cost write-offs;
• Continued operating profits in all of our homebuilding regions, before asset impairments and land option cost write-offs, as well as in our financial services operations;
• $315 million of homebuilding SG&A expense reductions;
• A 29% reduction of our land and lot supply (a 42% reduction from the peak at March 31, 2006);
• A 30% reduction of our homes in inventory (a 50% reduction from the peak at June 30, 2006); and
• A 50 basis point improvement in our net homebuilding debt to total capital, to 40.2%.
These hard-fought achievements were impressive, considering the major downturn occurring in so many of our markets during 2007. We expect these conditions will likely persist throughout fiscal 2008 and may increase in intensity. Consequently, our focus will remain on improving the strong financial position of our company by continuing to:
• Offer high-quality, affordable homes with sales incentives necessary to meet the market;
• Reduce our inventory of homes and owned lots;
• Significantly limit our capital outlays for land and lot acquisitions and development costs; • Control our costs of construction;
• Reduce our SG&A costs to be in line with our expectation of future home closings;
• Generate positive cash flows from operations; and
• Reduce our outstanding debt.
We expect that our actions will maintain our strong balance sheet and liquidity position and will provide us with flexibility to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities as they become available. We believe the long-term fundamental factors which support new home sales remain solid. Throughout this downturn and

beyond, our goal is to continue to outsell our competition and further distance ourselves from the rest of the industry in terms of operating profits and balance sheet strength.
We appreciate and thank our employees for all of their efforts this year. We also thank our thousands of suppliers and subcontractors, who are also part of our extended D. R. Horton family. Our team of employees, suppliers and subcontractors will be the driving force behind our future profitability and growth.
We thank all D.R. Horton shareholders for helping us build a strong company with a solid foundation. In appreciation of our shareholders, and supported by the $1.4 billion of cash flows generated by our operations, we maintained our cash dividends during fiscal 2007 despite the challenging market conditions. We continue to believe that our business and our stock valuation have long-term upside potential. Our belief is based on our unmatched competitive advantages, including our decentralized and entrepreneurial business model,
geographic diversity, low overhead cost structure, operating margins, economies of scale, liquidity position and balance sheet strength, as well as the solid long-term fundamentals supporting U.S. housing demand. We look forward to continuing to outperform the industry in fiscal 2008 as the largest and strongest homebuilder in America.
Donald R. Horton
Chairman of the Board
