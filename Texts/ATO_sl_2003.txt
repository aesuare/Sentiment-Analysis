                     Letter to Operational Financial Atmos Energy Board of Corporate Shareholders Review Review Officers Directors Information
 DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
I am extremely proud of all the work by Atmos Energy’s employees who made our 20th anniversary year such a success.
Atmos Energy is a company that works. Our 2,905 employees work hard to serve our customers and to deliver strong financial results. For the past two decades, their efforts have produced consistent growth and above-average returns for our 70,000 owners. That was true again in fiscal 2003. We achieved
a 20 percent increase in net income and a 6 percent rise in earnings per diluted share.
In fiscal 2003, Atmos Energy earned
$71.7 million. Earnings per diluted
share were $1.54 and were within our
stated guidance of $1.52 to $1.58 per
diluted share. Moreover, we exceeded
our industry peer group’s average
total return of 16.4 percent, delivering
a solid 17.2 percent total return to
our shareholders. Return on average
shareholders’ equity was 9.9 percent.
Recognizing these successful results, the Board
of Directors in November 2003 increased the annual dividend rate by 2 cents per share. In fiscal 2003, Atmos Energy paid total cash dividends of $1.20 per share. The indicated annual dividend rate for fiscal 2004 is $1.22 per share.
Paying cash dividends consistently is one of the best measures of a company’s financial strength. Atmos Energy’s record of consecutive annual dividend increases ranks it among the top 2.5 percent of corporations that pay dividends.

Our consistent dividend increases, along with recent cuts in the federal income tax on dividends, have made our stock more attractive to investors seeking value and growth. To the extent our operating results and financial condition permit, the Board
of Directors remains committed to raising the dividend annually and to lowering the payout ratio in the future to around 65 percent of earnings.
2003IN REVIEW
Fiscal 2003 was not without challenges. One of the
major hurdles we had to overcome was natural gas prices that were both high and volatile.
Zig-zagging gas prices put additional demands on our collection efforts and cut into both our utility and nonutility earnings. Like other corporations,
we also faced the added challenge of controlling rapidly rising costs for our employee pension plan, medical coverage and liability insurance.
Through the dedicated determi- nation of our employees, we not only
managed those matters, but also achieved other successes. Ten achievements stand out because they will contribute to our long-term success.
10MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS
First, we took advantage of a window of opportunity
to sell 4.1 million common shares. The sale strength- ened our balance sheet by improving our debt-to-equity ratio and bolstered our high credit ratings.

 Second, we made a $77 million contribution to our pension plan to adequately fund the plan. This should help to protect our employees and retirees
and to reduce our future pension funding requirements.
Third, we closed our acquisition of Mississippi Valley Gas Company and welcomed some 260,000 new utility customers and 600 employees of Valley Gas into Atmos Energy. The transaction was the company’s ninth major acquisition.
Fourth, we renewed our credit facilities in both our utility and nonutility operations. These credit agreements have allowed us to finance all of our oper- ations in an orderly and disciplined fashion.
Fifth, we received rate increases in Louisiana and in Amarillo, Texas,
and we achieved
weather normaliza-
tion adjustments
in Kansas and Amarillo. Our ability to grow our earnings relies on our continual success in achieving fair rate designs and keeping rates current.
Sixth, by using our 49.4 billion cubic feet of usable and contracted natural gas storage and fixed- forward supply contracts, we hedged about half
of our winter gas supply to save our utility customers more than $67 million last year in gas costs.
Seventh, we took steps to enhance the profitability of our nonutility operations by contracting for an additional 1.25 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage, installing a new billing system and renegotiating contracts to reduce the risk of price volatility.

These 10 achievements reflect many of the characteristics that differentiate Atmos Energy in the business of delivering natural gas.
Eighth, we pursued our passion for customer service. Excellence in customer service is an attitude and it starts with each employee. During 2003, we launched a systemwide customer service training program.
Ninth, our investments in technology yielded increas- ing dividends. Our Enterprise Asset Management Project, as described on page 18, is the latest in a long list of information and telecommunications advances we’ve made. With our highly automated Customer Support Center and Internet site, we’re serving customers better and at lower costs.
Tenth, we continued to manage our total spending in strategic ways. Both our capital outlays and operation and maintenance expense were under budget.
Capital expen- ditures during fiscal 2003 were $159 million.
Our O&M expense per customer of $122 continues to compare favorably to our peer group’s average expense of $195. Closely managing capital and O&M expenditures helps us stay highly competitive.
These 10 achievements reflect many of the characteristics that differentiate Atmos Energy in the business of delivering natural gas. This summary annual report discusses those characteristics that during the past 20 years have made Atmos Energy
a company that works.
2004 OUTLOOK
We expect fiscal 2004 will be a challenging
year. High gas costs will make collecting customer bills more difficult and will require us to make higher cash outlays for gas supplies. We have targeted
 annual earnings growth of 3 percent to 5 percent, with our earnings per diluted share expected to range from $1.55 to $1.60.
As Atmos Energy enters its third decade, the company is well positioned for long-term growth and continued success. Our balance sheet is strong;
our credit ratings are high; our rate filings have added to revenues and have reduced the effects of weather
on profitability; and our earnings have grown at a steady pace, enabling us to pay higher dividends each year.
FOUNDATION OF SUCCESS
The foundation of Atmos Energy’s success has
been built on our utility operations, which provide about 80 percent of our net income. Through acquisitions, we have evolved from a regional Texas gas utility to one of the country’s largest natural gas distribution companies. We are known for making responsible, disciplined and accretive acquisitions.
To strengthen the company’s foundation, we have added opportunities for long-term growth through our nonutility operations. Our natural
gas marketing business, for instance, ranks as one of the best in the industry based on independent customer satisfaction surveys.
We have pursued a consistent strategy of running our utilities well, of making sound acquisitions
and of expanding our nonutility business. Our reputa- tion has grown not from our size, but from the neighborliness, mettle and strength of character of Atmos Energy’s employees.
Our commitment to strong ethics and integrity has been part of the company since its founding, long before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed. To reiterate that commitment, the Board of Directors this past year reviewed and revised its committee charters and our code of conduct for all directors, officers and employees.
We pledge to continue to manage Atmos Energy for long-term success, not for immediate or personal gains. Our goals remain to grow and prosper financially, to foster great customer service, to be a safe and rewarding place to work and to benefit all those who associate with Atmos Energy—
our shareholders, customers, communities and employees. I thank you, our owners, and all of our employees for supporting these goals.
Consistency in purpose, financial results and ethical conduct stands as Atmos Energy’s foremost strength as we observe our 20th year.
