Letter
To Our Shareholders, Customers and Associates:
2006 Financial Performance
In 2006 we realigned our business infrastructure to reduce costs, support increased sales, maximize service levels, and to grow and strengthen customer relationships. Although we experienced challenges during 2006, we made headway on a number of fronts. As a result of our continued focus on the basic fundamentals of our business, Sanmina-SCI reported sales of $10.96 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.19 from continuing operations for the year ended September 30, 2006. Gross margins increased from 5.5% to 5.8%, a 5% improvement year over year.
Several of our strategic end markets experienced significant growth in 2006. Defense and Aerospace grew by 35.4%, Medical by 9.7%, Multimedia

and Consumer by 14.2%, and the Industrial, Semiconductor and Automotive business segment grew 14.0% year over year. We continued to experience weakness in the Personal and
Business Computing sector which declined 19.6% mainly due to an overall weakness in demand for desktop PC’s. This decline was partially offset by increased penetration in our more profitable
end markets.
During the year, Sanmina-SCI refinanced its 10.375% high yield debt due 2010 with 8.125% high yield debt due 2016. Additionally, we repaid $150 million in long term debt and extended our average debt maturities. As a result of our flexibility and operating efficiency, the Company ended the year with a strong balance sheet with cash of $492 million and liquidity of approximately $860 million.

             Focus on the Fundamentals
Sanmina-SCI continues to concentrate on the basic fundamentals of the business to improve the ability to leverage our core strengths, boost operational performance and provide better service to customers around the world.

We add value to our customers by providing the most efficient and effective solution for them to enhance their design, manufacturing and logistics requirements whether in North America, Europe, Asia or the Middle East.
We have expanded our Joint Design Manufacturing (JDM) services to reduce our customers’ time-to- market and R&D costs. Working with the customer early in the design phase ensures product manufacturability, quality and reliability. We
