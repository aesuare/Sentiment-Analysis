 A Letter to Our Shareholders
Delivering on our promises
During the past year, we continued our pattern of growth and progress despite some serious economic and market challenges. An added obstacle during the past year was the declining confidence in corporate America. Unfortunately, the actions of a few have cascaded into an overall concern with business ethics. At Cooper, however, we have main- tained an unwavering focus on our plans and strategies so that we can continue to deliver on our promises to our shareholders, our customers and our people.
We selected the theme Delivering on our promises for the 2002 annual report because we believe it accurately portrays what we have accomplished during the past few years. It also accurately describes the type of company that we have always been – straightforward and focused on generating shareholder value.
In 1999, we initiated a strategic transformation of our company. As we announced and implemented those plans, we made several related commitments and promises to our people, our customers and our shareholders.
2002 was a year in which we delivered on many of those promises and made solid progress on the rest.
At the time of our acquisitions of Standard Products and Siebe Automotive, we stated publicly that it would take three years to fully integrate the businesses and achieve normalized operating levels. As I said, we have made a lot of promises to our shareholders, to our employees and to the public since then. We have developed and implemented some very aggressive but achievable plans to drive shareholder value.
Promises:
• Expand Automotive Group Globally
• Grow Market Share
• Outperform our Industries
• Restructuring Savings of $30 million
• Pay down 2002 debt with cash
• Automotive Operating Margins of 10%
Pre-Tax Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) of 20%
The acquisitions in late 1999 and early 2000,
primarily in our automotive group, enabled us to deliver on the promise we would expand the automotive group globally.
In North America, our automotive component
sales were up about 7.2 percent while light vehicle production was up about 5.3 percent. Sales in our international operations were up 7.8 percent. The tire group unit sales in North America were up more than
4 percent even though market shipments were down 2.6 percent.
We exceeded our goal of $30 million in annual savings from our restructuring efforts.
We paid off the $225 million portion of acquisition- related debt with cash when it came due in December.
We said that our goal was to return our automotive
operating margins to near their historical levels but on four times greater sales volume. We achieved that target during the second quarter, and averaged within two percentage points of that goal for the year 2002.

And finally, we have a goal of 20 percent pre-tax ROIC. We are not there yet, but we are confident that we will get that checked off in the not-too-distant future.
In short, we have told you what we were going to do, and we have done it.
We are staying focused on our plans and continue to drive for leaner operations, taking costs out wherever possible and being as efficient as we can be. The results of our lean efforts were key this year. We generated nearly $100 million in lean savings through the implemen- tation of literally thousands of lean initiatives throughout our operations.
The tire group continues to manage its assets
and provide the same great service and products to our customers. Even though we reduced inventory by more than 1.2 million units last year, our order fill rates were at or near our 95 percent goal.
While we continue to receive top industry honors in customer service from our dealer network, we also received national recognition from consumers this year. The J.D. Power and Associates 2002 Replacement Tire Customer Satisfaction StudySM ranked Cooper the highest light truck replacement tire in a tie.This type of well-earned recognition will be a part of our success in the future and indicates some of the sustainable strengths that we have been developing in tire technology.
Providing top-notch launches for our automotive customers had an escalated importance this year as we had 59 new launches.The Cooper integrated launch team approach that we have implemented in all our facilities has quickly improved the success rate of our new product launches and that shows up in our operating margins.This approach also will benefit us going into 2003 as we have approximately 30 launches in the coming year.
One of the most significant highlights of the year occurred in the second quarter when we announced earnings of 52 cents per share, which was an all-time company record. And, for the second consecutive year, the average closing price of our stock increased.
Additionally, with our plans and execution, we have been able to beat our peers and the S&P 500 during the past three years. We are very happy about that.

So this is what Cooper looked like at the end
of 2002 – a Fortune 500 company with global presence, great accomplishments and great opportunity.
Even though things are improving significantly
for Cooper, I certainly think that we will continue to
see challenging conditions in both our businesses at some point in the remainder of 2003. There is still a lot of uncertainty out there and we are in tough industries.
We recognize that. Still, we have solid plans in place to continue to make our company successful and to perform better than our industries overall.
On the tire side, we will again see our sales growing faster than the industry. There are signs that the industry overall will pick up as the year goes on and we think we will be even stronger than the industry. On the automotive side of our business, production schedules may be slightly lighter in 2003 but our new business will allow our sales to out-pace the industry yet again.
These continue to be exciting times at Cooper Tire & Rubber Company. We are primed to be among the winners in an increasingly competitive environment.
On behalf of the 23,000 Cooper people, thank you for your continued support.
