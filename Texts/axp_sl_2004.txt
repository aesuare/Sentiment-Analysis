To Our Shareholders: American Express had an outstanding year in 2004 -- one that marked the beginning of a new era for the company. We delivered record financial results, led an historic change in the card industry and prepared our businesses to take advantage of substantial opportunities for growth in the years ahead. Excellent performance in our card business, increased travel sales and progress in financial services all contributed to record earnings and revenues. Our focus on improving our economics and increasing business-building investments over the past three years generated strong momentum across our businesses in 2004. >

Our time.

Kenneth I. Chenault, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

While our traditional businesses gained strength, we also entered into our first card-issuing partnerships with U.S. banks, forging a new competitive landscape in the payments industry. Together, these developments set the stage for another transformational change -- our decision to pursue a spin-off of American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA), which we announced in early 2005. With these changes, we are writing a new chapter in our long history of continually reinventing American Express.

Financial Results
Our 2004 financial results clearly demonstrated our momentum: Record net income of $3.4 billion, up 15 percent from $3.0 billion a year ago. Diluted earnings per share of $2.68, a 17 percent increase from $2.30 last year. Record revenues of $29.1 billion, which rose 13 percent from $25.8 billion in 2003. Return on equity of 22.0 percent, compared with 20.6 percent a year ago. These results exceeded our long-term targets of 12 to 15 percent earnings per share growth, 8 percent revenue growth and 18 to 20 percent return on equity. We were particularly pleased with the robust revenue and earnings growth in the second half of the year, when comparisons became more challenging due to the strength of our 2003 performance. Record spending on American Express charge and credit cards in 2004 enabled us to gain share in the United States at one of the fastest rates in several years. We also performed well compared to peer companies in growing revenues and assets at AEFA.

Shareholder Returns
Wall Street rewarded our financial results and business momentum. In 2004, American Express' total shareholder return exceeded that of the major market indices and most of our peer companies. Our total shareholder return was 18 percent, compared with 5 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 11 percent for both the S&P 500 and S&P Financials. Another sign of investor confidence in our company is the relative valuation of our stock. American Express ended the year with the highest price-to-earnings multiple of any of the top 25 global financial services companies. We work to create shareholder value by delivering consistent growth, profitability and stability. This philosophy is a guiding principle for us, and because it has important implications for how we manage the business, I want to spend some time describing each of the elements.

Growth: We continued to strike what we believe is an appropriate balance between achieving our net income growth targets and investing in our future. In 2004, we delivered record earnings while increasing spending on marketing, promotion, rewards and cardmember services by 30 percent from a year ago. This increase came on top of a stepped-up level of investment spending in 2003.

Our business-building activities over the past several quarters generated substantially higher customer volumes in 2004, including: exceptional growth in cards-in-force and spending per card, higher sales and asset levels at AEFA, and increased commissions, fees and assets at American Express Bank (AEB). The strength of our current business and future prospects led us to pursue the spin-off of AEFA. The proposed spin-off will enable both American Express and AEFA to focus attention and resources on maximizing our best growth opportunities. American Express will be able to concentrate resources on our global payments and network businesses, where we have the highest returns on investment and enormous potential for growth given the excellent competitive position of our proprietary card business and new opportunities created by our U.S. network business. The spin-off will strengthen our ability to meet and exceed our long-term targets for earnings and revenue growth, and enable us to increase our long-term return on equity target to 28 to 30 percent from the current 18 to 20 percent. After the spin-off, American Express will be the world's largest charge and credit card issuer by spend volume and operate a network that processes more than $400 billion in transactions from millions of merchants throughout the world. We will also continue to operate the leading global travel and Travelers Cheque businesses and an international bank serving affluent consumers and financial institutions. Our spend-centric business model and multiple product lines provide diverse sources of revenue and differentiate us from competitors. We have a broad-based, global franchise with leadership positions in the consumer, small business, middle market and large corporate card sectors. We have a diverse array of charge, lending, co-brand and prepaid payment products. In addition, unlike many of our card competitors whose business models are focused on lending, we generate revenues largely from activities associated with cardmember spending, as well as from lending, network services and other fees. For AEFA, operating as an independent company would provide more flexibility and resources to grow its asset management and insurance businesses, and its financial planning and advice activities. AEFA would not have to compete for resources with other American Express businesses, and therefore would be able to react more quickly to market opportunities for new products, partnerships and expansion. We believe this is a winning scenario for American Express, AEFA and our shareholders.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE Earnings Growth_ Our focus on growth, profitability and stability resulted in higher earnings per share in 2004. Diluted EPS rose to $2.68, a 17 percent increase over 2003 -- ahead of our long-term target of 12 to 15 percent growth on average and over time.

$2.68 $2.30 $2.07 $2.01

We expect the spin-off will be completed in the third quarter of 2005, subject to regulatory approvals and certain conditions. Across our businesses, we believe the opportunities for growth have never been greater. We think about them in three categories: organic, expanded, and joint ventures and acquisitions. Organic Growth: Unlike many of the largest financial services firms, American Express has generated most of its growth organically, rather than through mergers and acquisitions. Our spend-centric business model in cards and the financial planning and advice approach at AEFA, which I will discuss later in more detail, have unique competitive advantages. In addition, our commitment to delivering premium value through our products and services has significantly increased retention and loyalty among our best customers and attracted many new ones to our franchise. The opportunity for additional growth in spending on payment cards is huge. Today, global spending on general-purpose cards exceeds $3.2 trillion, and that is only a small portion of what economists estimate to be a market of more than $20 trillion in consumer spending alone. Even in the United States, the world's largest market, cards account for only about one-third of total consumer spending. There is plenty of room to grow the global market and our share of it -- for both our proprietary payments business and our network business. The same is true for AEFA, which we believe is well positioned to meet the growing planning, advice, asset management and insurance needs of its target segment -- "mass affluent" individuals and families. Expanded Opportunities: In addition to organic growth from traditional sources, we are also focused on developing opportunities in rapidly emerging areas of our business. We refer to these as expanded opportunities because they leverage existing products and capabilities in new ways. The most prominent example is the launch of our Global Network Services business, or GNS, in the United States. In October 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of lower court rulings against Visa and MasterCard in the antitrust case brought by the federal government. This decision effectively struck down, once and for all, Visa and MasterCard rules that had prevented U.S. banks from issuing cards on rival networks. With these illegal restrictions now abolished, banks can work with any network they choose and consumers can benefit from greater choice and marketplace innovation. For our company, partnering with U.S. banks that want to issue American Express-branded cards is a significant new growth opportunity, on top of the tremendous existing opportunities in our proprietary card business.

Our Brand. Late last year, we launched a major marketing campaign to
promote the American Express brand worldwide. "My life. My card." features prominent cardmembers such as renowned actor Robert De Niro and awardwinning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres.

During 2004, we announced our first two card-issuing partnerships with major U.S. banks -- MBNA and Citibank. Ultimately, we expect to partner with a range of banks in the U.S. -- small, medium and large institutions. Some issuers will convert specific, high-spending segments of their customer base onto our network, while others will add American Expressbranded cards to their product portfolio to attract new affluent customers. I will discuss our GNS strategy -- both in the newly opened U.S. market and internationally, where GNS is an established success story with 87 partnerships in 98 countries -- in greater detail later in this letter. Our network business is only one of the expanded opportunities for American Express. We are excited about the rapidly growing area of prepaid services, which offers tremendous potential to capture spending that would otherwise go to cash and checks. We are also making strong progress in growing our Corporate Middle Market business, a largely untapped and growing segment of the corporate travel and expense management market. Joint Ventures and Acquisitions: Because we have been consistently able to generate strong growth from within our business, we have not had to rely on acquisitions to sustain our revenue growth. Instead, we have taken a highly selective approach to acquisitions, pursuing only those opportunities that can enhance our capabilities and accelerate growth in core lines of business. We did not make any major acquisitions in 2004. Rather, we focused on successfully integrating two significant ones from 2003 -- Threadneedle Asset Management Holdings Limited, a leading U.K. investment management firm, and Rosenbluth International, one of the most respected companies in the travel management industry. Both have exceeded our expectations in terms of business performance and integration.

Increasing Profitability: Revenue growth is important, but profitable growth is the ultimate
barometer of success. We have devoted a great deal of energy over the past four years to improving the economics of our business. As a result, we have seen consistent increases in return on equity and a stronger balance sheet. We also have an attractive risk/return profile compared to others in our industries. Reengineering has played a key role in improving our profit margins and freeing up resources to invest in growth. In 2004, we delivered more than $1 billion in reengineering benefits for the fourth year in a row. Our pre-tax margin improved to 17.0 percent from 16.4 percent a year ago. We consider reengineering to be a critical and ongoing aspect of our management strategy at American Express. We focus on making core processes more efficient by reducing costs while increasing quality. In fact, much of our savings from reengineering now come from Six Sigma quality improvement projects. As an example, in our U.S. cardmember servicing network we used Six Sigma and other tools to significantly improve our already high customer satisfaction results while reducing unit costs in 2004. We will continue to focus intensely on reengineering, being careful not to lose our sense of urgency despite our excellent financial performance.

We have also enhanced our returns by reallocating capital to fund growth opportunities. In 2004, we took a series of actions along these lines, including the sales of our small business equipment leasing operation and our ATM business, as well as the sale and leasing back of certain owned real estate properties in the United States. At the same time, we are also raising the overall return rate we generate from our investments by implementing a more disciplined process for analyzing and prioritizing investments based on strategic impact, return and risk.

Stability: Achieving consistent growth and profitability over long periods of time is a difficult management challenge for any company, given the unpredictable impact of economic trends and other external factors. At American Express, we have focused on those things we can control: improving our economics, increasing the flexibility of our business to adapt to changing market conditions, enhancing our forecasting capabilities and lowering our risk profile. Risk management is a critical capability for our company. In 2004, we continued to improve these practices across our major businesses. As a result, we maintained industry-leading credit quality in our card business. At AEFA, we strengthened our owned investment portfolio over the past several years by reducing high-yield investments while increasing our holdings in higher-rated corporate debt. At American Express Bank, we also lowered risk by continuing our shift from corporate lending to consumer activities. Through our consistent focus on the fundamentals of growth, profitability and stability, we have increased momentum in our business. At the same time, historic new opportunities have opened up to us, and we stand ready to capitalize on major change in our industries.

Business Unit Results
T R AV E L R E L AT E D S E R V I C E S

Travel Related Services (TRS) -- which includes our card, travel, network services and Travelers Cheque businesses -- had record net income of $2.9 billion in 2004, up 17 percent from a year ago. Revenues also reached a new high, rising 12 percent to $21.6 billion. Strong growth in spending and lending on American Express cards, excellent credit quality, and higher travel sales drove these results. In our card business, our spend-centric model provides us with unique competitive advantages. We focus on winning the loyalty of high-spending cardmembers and driving their spending to merchants who accept American Express cards. In the United States, average spending on American Express cards is about four times higher than on MasterCard and Visa cards, continuing our wide lead. As a result, we are able to deliver more high-spending and loyal customers to merchants and therefore earn a premium discount rate. The higher revenues we earn from spending on our network enable us to deliver greater value to cardmembers through more attractive rewards and targeted incentives. This, in turn, stimulates spending and drives more business to merchants who accept our cards. Underlying this model is the exceptional service we aim to provide to cardmembers and merchants.

In 2004, worldwide spending on American Express cards reached an all-time high of $416 billion, up 18 percent from a year ago. This performance exceeded the organic spending growth of all major card issuers. Our focus on providing premium value to our cardmembers, offering best-in-class rewards programs and expanding the use of American Express cards in retail and everyday-spend categories fueled strong growth in average spending per cardmember. In addition to deepening relationships with existing cardmembers, we also focused on adding new high-spending cardmembers to our franchise. We added a net total of 4.9 million cards in 2004 -- one of our largest annual increases ever -- bringing overall cards-in-force to 65.4 million at year-end. Our excellent growth in cardmember spending reflects broad-based gains across the consumer, corporate and small business segments in the United States and internationally. These gains cut across all merchant categories -- retail, everyday spending, and travel and entertainment. For Global Network Services cards, volumes rose more than 30 percent, reflecting higher growth from existing partnerships and strong performance from partners added in 2004. While spending is at the heart of our business model, cardmember lending is an important complementary activity. Cardmember loans include balances on revolving credit cards as well as lending features on our charge card products. Although loan growth across the industry slowed from a year ago, our organic growth continued to outpace the industry average. As I mentioned earlier, credit performance has been a critical element in the strong growth of our card business. Both in the United States and across international markets, we are at or near historic lows in both our charge and lending write-off and past-due rates. We have benefited from generally strong economies, but our achievements go beyond environmental factors. We have made advances in our information capabilities, our modeling, and in the business approach we bring to bear on credit decisions -- all of which has served to drive down provision rates, even as we grow our overall business at a rapid pace. To sustain our momentum and strengthen our competitive position, we introduced a wide array of new products, services, rewards programs and partnerships around the world in 2004. For example: We launched a major new card brand advertising campaign in the United States and seven international markets. "My life. My card." is our first campaign supporting both the proprietary and network businesses.

Welcoming New Cardmembers_ We added a net total of 4.9 million American Express cards in 2004. This increase -- one of our largest ever -- illustrates the strength of our proprietary card-issuing business and the continued expansion of Global Network Services.

We extended our successful alliance with Costco and launched new co-branded cards for consumers and small businesses with a unique cash-back value proposition. We enhanced our Membership Rewards program by expanding into new industries and adding a wide range of partners, most notably JetBlue Airways. We continued to expand our card offerings in the small business arena, where American Express is the market leader. In addition to the Costco TrueEarnings Business card, we also introduced Business Green Rewards and Blue Cash for Business, as well as a new savings program for small-business owners called OPEN Savings. We introduced American Express Selects, a new global cardmember benefit with nearly 4,000 premium shopping, dining, travel and entertainment offers and experiences from merchants in 24 markets. We launched more than 80 new or enhanced proprietary card products in international markets including consumer, commercial, co-brand, distribution and affinity cards. We launched new corporate card products to add to our leadership position in this segment, including a new jointly branded card distributed by Deutsche Bank, as well as enhanced online travel and expense management offerings. We signed agreements with Delta Air Lines to extend our co-brand, Membership Rewards and merchant partnership into the next decade. We expanded the network of merchants that accept American Express cards around the world, including signings in new industry categories. We also launched Business Savings -- a new program that offers merchants who accept American Express cards discounts on a variety of everyday business expenditures. American Express has the broadest array of charge, lending and co-brand card products and rewards programs across the consumer, small business and corporate segments.
HISTORIC CHANGE IN U.S. CREDIT CARD MARKET

As I mentioned earlier, the biggest news in the card industry in 2004 was the Supreme Court decision that paved the way for open competition among card networks in the United States. In January 2004, in anticipation of that result, we announced our agreement for MBNA to issue American Express-branded cards targeted to its high-spending customers and prospects. MBNA began issuing these cards in November, following the Court's decision, and the launch got off to a great start. Response has been strong and overall spending volumes and average transaction size have been even higher than we expected. In December, we announced our agreement with Citibank, one of the world's leading financial institutions,

to launch American Express-branded cards in 2005. Partnering with institutions as large and prestigious as MBNA and Citibank illustrates the significant potential of this business for American Express and our partners. The new paradigm in the United States, in which we have both a proprietary card-issuing business and now a network business with bank partners, is a major change for our company and for the payments industry. However, our overall strategy remains the same. First, we want to continue to have the strongest proprietary card business in the industry, delivering performance superior to any other issuer. Second, we want to be the network of choice for high-spending cardmembers. Achieving these complementary goals will serve to generate additional spending on the American Express network, increase the number of American Express-branded cards in the marketplace, and drive more business and profits to merchants who accept our cards. In addition to pursuing new opportunities in our network business, we have also filed a lawsuit against Visa, MasterCard and a number of large banks seeking compensation for business lost over many years as a result of the anti-competitive practices of the card associations. American Express has been in the network business outside the United States for several years now, partnering with banks to issue American Express-branded cards accepted on our global merchant network. We have a good understanding of the keys to success, and we have found that having a vibrant network business also serves to strengthen our proprietary card business. GNS is already an important part of the American Express franchise and a key part of our growth strategy. GNS partners have added more than eight million bank-issued cards since 1997. As this card base has grown, GNS partners have added more than three million new establishments to the American Express merchant network around the world. Cards-inforce and spending on GNS cards have grown dramatically. Outside of the United States, one of every two new cards acquired in 2004 was a bank-issued card, and GNS partners brought nearly one of every three new merchants into the American Express network. In 2004, we signed 14 new GNS partnerships with financial institutions. In addition to MBNA and Citibank in the United States, we also signed a landmark agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the largest bank and the leading issuer of credit cards in China. With more than 20,000 branch locations, ICBC has tremendous distribution reach. Through this agreement, ICBC is issuing the first-ever American Expressbranded cards in China. China's domestic card market, which until earlier this year was closed to foreign card companies, is still in its early stages of development, but it presents tremendous potential for growth. Other GNS signings during the year included CorpBanca in Chile and Westpac in Australia.

Just as it has done in international markets, opening the network in the United States should enable us to: increase the number of American Express-branded cards in the marketplace drive more high-spending transaction volume through our network increase the acceptance of our cards by merchants around the world provide more value for merchants by delivering more high-spending cardmembers to their establishments create a significant new revenue stream for the company leverage our existing merchant network. The economics of a successful network business are compelling. We earn revenues on the additional transaction volume that GNS cards generate on our merchant network. Since we already have a robust infrastructure in place to handle this volume, the expense we incur in generating these revenues is relatively modest. In addition, because our card-issuing partners own the customer receivables on GNS cards and bear the credit and funding risk, our capital commitment is also relatively modest. As a result, we earn returns that can provide additional resources for investments in growth across all our businesses. Banks realize many benefits from partnering with American Express. They can expand and strengthen their product offerings by adding American Express-branded cards to their portfolios. This enables them to give their customers greater choice and helps them to differentiate their products. In addition, our partners are able to design new products built around customer spending, which is a fundamental change from traditional Visa and MasterCard products that typically rely on high revolving credit balances to drive profits. In many respects, opening the network in the United States is a natural evolution of our business, and we expect it will take the benefits of our global merchant network to a new level.

Without the same fanfare that accompanied some developments in our card business, travel experienced a rebound in business volumes in 2004. Commissions and fees for consumer and business travel combined rose 19 percent, and American Express strengthened its leading position in the industry with the successful integration of Rosenbluth International. Our Consumer Travel Network continued to be an important part of our brand presence and service delivery around the world. For many of our customers -- not just travelers but card, foreign exchange and Travelers Cheque customers as well -- our travel network of more than 1,700 locations provides important support that enhances their experience with American Express. In 2004, we expanded exclusive travel programs and enhanced online offerings by adding a private label version of the Travelocity booking service for air, hotel and car rental reservations and an online cruise booking service from OurVacationStore.

In Business Travel, we added more than $1.8 billion in sales volume from new accounts during 2004. We also took major steps to restructure our Business Travel organization to increase service levels and expand our product portfolio while lowering operating costs. Some of these actions resulted in job eliminations as we increased efficiency and more volumes shifted to online channels. However, the steps we have taken will strengthen our position as the worldwide leader in business travel. We offer a wide array of business travel management solutions to our clients, and we are the largest online provider of managed business travel.
T R AV E L E R S C H E Q U E S A N D P R E PA I D S E R V I C E S

This year was also a turning point for our Travelers Cheque and Prepaid Services business. We grew sales of paper Travelers Cheques for the first time in three years, due to the rebound in travel as well as targeted marketing programs and expanded distribution channels. Travelers Cheque sales rose to $19.9 billion, up 3 percent from a year ago. In addition, we made major progress in our prepaid card business. We see significant potential for growth in this category, which is high on our list of expanded opportunities. In 2004, we focused on increasing sales of American Express Gift Cards and introducing the Travelers Cheque Card, a prepaid alternative to the traditional paper-based Travelers Cheque. Gift Card sales tripled from the prior year, and the average amount loaded on our Gift Cards was nearly 70 percent higher than the store-specific cards we track. We launched a new Gift Card in Japan and introduced the Travelers Cheque Card in Germany. We also expanded the distribution network for prepaid cards with more than 12,000 new locations, including banks, malls, drugstores and supermarkets.
AMERICAN EXPRESS FINANCIAL ADVISORS

American Express Financial Advisors is a diversified financial services company that helps individuals, businesses and institutions meet their financial goals through asset management and insurance products and services, and relationships built around financial planning and advice. AEFA's field force of more than 12,000 financial advisors is one of the largest in the United States, with more certified financial plannerTM professionals than any other company. At the end of 2004, AEFA had more than $410 billion in assets owned, managed and administered; and over $145 billion in life insurance in force. AEFA's strategy focuses on building relationships with high-value clients in the mass affluent segment: individuals with $100,000 to $1 million in investable assets. This group is generally under-served in the market, and AEFA's planning and advice-based approach allows it to profitably provide high-touch service to them.

Our Innovations. We continued to create more value for our customers by
introducing unique products and services in 2004. In our U.S. consumer card business, for example, we introduced the IN:NYC credit card, customized with benefits just for New Yorkers. We also began to expand the availability of ExpressPay, our contactless payment product, to consumers nationwide.

During 2004, AEFA made good progress on efforts to strengthen its asset management capabilities, enhance product offerings, improve service and expand consumer awareness of its business. These efforts contributed to improved earnings, revenue and sales performance. For the year, AEFA posted income before accounting changes of $806 million, up 18 percent from 2003. Net income was $735 million, an increase of 10 percent. Total revenues rose 15 percent on higher sales and asset levels due to improved market conditions and the benefits of business-building efforts. Threadneedle contributed approximately 5 percent to revenue growth during the year. Total product sales rose sharply, up 17 percent, to more than $63 billion. Mutual fund cash sales increased 15 percent. Non-proprietary mutual fund sales rose, while proprietary sales were relatively flat. Insurance product sales rose 19 percent, with both property/casualty and life insurance experiencing strong growth. In the Property Casualty business, net premium sales grew by 25 percent, which was about five times the industry average. Total sales of annuities declined 6 percent as a decrease in fixed annuity sales was partially offset by higher variable product sales. Because of its emphasis on advice-based relationships with clients, more than 75 percent of AEFA's total product sales from advisors were generated through financial planning and advice services. Fees from financial plans and advice services rose 15 percent to $139 million. AEFA grew assets owned, managed and administered by 13 percent, a performance that compared favorably to peer companies. Assets per retail client rose 9 percent. Higher asset levels drove strong increases in management and distribution fee revenue. Although outflows from our domestic proprietary mutual funds continued, total net asset flows improved, largely due to the full-year impact of Threadneedle and increased sales of wrap accounts. AEFA's advisor field force grew by 2 percent, while most competitors experienced declines. The growth took place as a result of improving recruitment and selection processes, as well as productivity and retention enhancements. The veteran advisor retention rate reached an all-time high.
Threadneedle Integration One of AEFA's most important accomplishments in 2004 was the successful integration of Threadneedle, whose operations include the third largest retail money management firm in the United Kingdom. The purchase of Threadneedle was the firm's largest acquisition in

the past 15 years. The integration enhanced AEFA's international asset management capabilities and scale. AEFA transferred management of its international and global equity portfolios to Threadneedle in late 2003.
Investment Performance Improving performance in AEFA's institutional, retail and owned asset portfolios has been a top priority. Over the past several years, AEFA has taken major steps to enhance its investment leadership, talent and infrastructure, and these efforts resulted in solid progress in 2004.

Focused on outperforming specific benchmarks, AEFA began improving its fixed income performance in 2003 and followed it up with a very strong 2004. In equities, AEFA saw strong results in many portfolios, particularly those led by new fund managers brought in over the past several years. However, a few large equity portfolios under-performed in 2004.
New Products and Services To deepen relationships with clients and attract new assets, AEFA launched a variety of new products and services in 2004. As part of its strategy to provide tiered offerings and differentiated products, AEFA completed the nationwide rollout of American Express Gold Financial Services. This offering is designed for clients with more than $100,000 in assets with the firm. AEFA also offers Platinum Financial Services, which targets clients with more than $500,000 in assets with the firm.

AEFA launched eight new mutual funds in 2004, as it continued to round out and reposition its offerings. A solid win in terms of asset gathering has been the AXP Portfolio Builder Series -- a group of six strategic asset allocation funds that address multiple investment needs. Portfolio Builder funds attracted more than $900 million in assets in 2004. For institutional clients, AEFA launched new services to support 401(k) programs of small and mid-sized companies to complement its established position servicing the large company 401(k) market. AEFA also expanded Financial Education and Planning Services (FEPS), through which corporations provide employees with access to financial planning and advice services in the workplace. FEPS has also proven to be an effective vehicle for retail client acquisition. Over the past three years, AEFA has made good progress in wide-ranging efforts to strengthen its business and position it for long-term success. These efforts have included: improving its earnings, revenues and return on equity growing the advisor force and improving the economics of its distribution network broadening its asset management reach internationally through the Threadneedle acquisition and the creation of a global fund of hedge funds platform significantly enhancing its investment management leadership, talent and infrastructure

strengthening its balance sheet and lowering its risk profile by reducing high-yield bond holdings in its owned investment portfolio accelerating new product development in asset management, insurance, annuity, brokerage and financial planning and advice services. AEFA is an outstanding business with a 110-year history of success. Over the past two decades it has made strong contributions to American Express. AEFA has made great progress in recent years and, as I noted earlier, we believe the best way to build on that momentum is for AEFA to operate independently, with its own common stock and investor base.
AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK

American Express Bank provides banking and other financial services to high-net-worth and affluent individuals outside the United States and to financial institutions worldwide. AEB delivered strong growth in its core Private Banking and Financial Institutions Group (FIG) businesses in 2004. However, net income was negatively affected by pre-tax charges of $44 million for the restructuring of certain operations. For the year, AEB earned net income of $96 million compared to $102 million a year ago. The restructuring charges related primarily to the decision to sell domestic commercial banking operations in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Egypt, where AEB has decided to focus on serving as an international partner for local banks through its financial institutions business. The charges also cover the sale of private banking client assets in Luxembourg. Higher sales of investment products to private banking clients and institutions drove a 19 percent increase in AEB's commissions and fees. This was partially offset by a 10 percent decline in net interest income largely due to a decision to temporarily curtail lending in Hong Kong because of economic conditions, as well as lower spread revenue due to the impact of higher interest rates. AEB continued to shift away from corporate lending as it focuses on private banking, consumer financial services and financial institutions. Corporate loans now make up just 1 percent of AEB's lending portfolio. Improved write-off rates in its consumer lending portfolio enabled AEB to significantly reduce its provisions for losses during the year. The Bank has made excellent progress in increasing its profitability in recent years. Return on equity rose to 10.0 percent from just 4.0 percent four years ago. AEB continued to significantly expand its array of investment products. The Bank launched six new fund portfolios during the year, along with a fund of hedge funds and flexible term loans. In addition, AEB opened four new representative offices in Poland, Australia, Kazakhstan and Atlanta to support the growth of its FIG business. The Private Bank opened a representative office in Cebu, Philippines.

Looking ahead, the Bank will continue to focus on serving financial institutions worldwide, as well as high-net-worth individuals and affluent consumers in markets outside the United States. AEB's lines of business and client relationships are closely aligned with our international payments business. For example, the Private Bank makes premium card products available to its wealthy clients, and the Financial Institutions Group provides services to many banks with which we have card or Travelers Cheque relationships.

Our Culture
Now that I have covered how we did in 2004, I want to share some thoughts about who we are. I am convinced that having unique and differentiated business models, well reasoned strategies and compelling market opportunities mean very little if you do not have strong values and the right culture to realize your potential. At American Express, we devote a great deal of time and energy to creating an environment that: enables people of all backgrounds to succeed and grow regardless of individual differences attracts the best and the brightest to work for us rewards our people for going above and beyond in the service of our customers and clients inspires them to serve our communities to help others in need sets high standards for excellence and integrity. In essence, we strive to be the kind of company that employees are proud to work for, customers and clients want to be associated with, and shareholders are eager to own. We are not perfect and we never will be, but we are committed to these ideals and to correcting our mistakes when we make them. Over the past four years, we have taken a number of steps to renew and reinforce our corporate values of customer commitment, quality, integrity, teamwork, respect for people, good citizenship, will to win and personal accountability. We have changed our performance management process to more closely align our actions with these values. And we have strengthened leadership development and control and compliance processes across the company. In all these efforts, we have stressed the paramount importance of integrity -- not out of a reflex reaction to headlines about corporate governance failures across the business world or increased regulatory scrutiny, but rather because integrity needs to remain a fundamental characteristic of our brand.

Our Citizenship. Serving the communities in which we live and work is one
of our core values. Through both the company and the American Express Foundation, which marked its 50th anniversary in 2004, we have contributed more than $450 million over the years in support of charitable organizations around the world.

Looking Ahead
While we feel very good about American Express' overall performance in 2004, that's not to say we are satisfied. We aspire to be more than a top company in our industries. Our ultimate goal is to be among the handful of the most consistently successful companies in the world, regardless of industry. This is an ambitious goal, but one we are excited to pursue and one that we believe we can achieve with the right focus and dedication. We are well positioned to sustain and even expand upon our excellent performance for several reasons: We have strong positions in global payments and network services, with business models that are differentiated from those of competitors, flexible and adaptable to varying economic conditions. Across each of our businesses, we have substantial organic growth opportunities and the ability to make strategic acquisitions selectively. We have broad and diverse revenue streams from cardmember spending, lending and fees; network related services; travel; and our international banking activities. We have a strong return on equity, with initiatives in place that should generate strong shareholder value over the moderate to long term. We are carefully managing risk to help ensure stability in the business. We have strengthened our balance sheet and improved our capital allocation process. Our organization has strong morale, talent, leadership and even stronger values. We take seriously our responsibilities as guardians of one of the world's best known and most respected brands. We are in a time of fundamental change in our industries, and American Express is at the forefront of that change. In our 154-year history, American Express has constantly transformed our businesses to reach new levels of success. I have no doubt that is exactly what we will do in the years ahead. I am proud to represent the people of American Express and want to thank my colleagues around the world for their dedication to their customers, shareholders and fellow colleagues.

Sincerely,
