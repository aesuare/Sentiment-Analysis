DEAR SHAREHOLDER
AT TOLL BROTHERS, WE ASPIRE TO EXCEL AT LUXURY RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE IN ALL ITS FORMS IN THE BEST MARKETS IN AMERICA .

The housing market continues on a pace of steady growth, and we are well-positioned to take advantage of it. On a compound average annual basis, our revenues, fiscal year-end backlog (in dollars), and contracts (in dollars) have grown 30%, 33%, and 25% respectively since their recent respective lows in FY 2011, 2010, and 2009. In FY 2015, our net income of $363.2 million, or $1.97 per share, rose 7%, and our pretax income of $535.6 million rose 6%, compared to FY 2014. Revenues of $4.17 billion and home building deliveries of 5,525 units increased 7% in dollars and 2% in units, compared to FY 2014. Net signed contracts of $4.96 billion and 5,910 units grew 27% in dollars and 12% in units, compared to FY 2014. And we ended the year with a backlog of $3.5 billion and 4,064 units, an increase of 29% and 10% respectively, compared to FY 2014. The $862,000 average price of homes in backlog at FYE 2015 was the highest in our history. We enjoyed solid demand throughout this fiscal year. FY 2015's fourth quarter was our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in contract units and dollars. Net signed contracts of $1.25 billion and 1,437 units rose 29% in dollars and 12% in units, compared to FY 2014's fourth quarter. The average price of net signed contracts, at $872,000, was the highest average price for any quarter in our history, driven by an increase in the number and average price of California contracts. On a per-community basis, FY 2015's fourth-quarter net signed contracts rose 4% to 5.21 units, compared to 5.01 units in FY 2014's fourth quarter. This momentum has continued into FY 2016's first quarter. We enter FY 2016 with a backlog up 29% in dollars and are experiencing a healthier housing market in many regions. As of

this writing, through the first five weeks of FY 2016, our contracts in units are up 21%, compared to FY 2015's same period. Therefore, we believe FY 2016 will be a year of strong growth in revenues and profit. We ended FY 2015 with 288 selling communities, compared to 267 one year ago. We expect similar community growth in FY 2016. With our solid backlog, we believe we will produce home building revenues of between $4.5 billion and $5.6 billion in FY 2016, based on delivering between 5,600 and 6,600 homes in FY 2016 at an average price of between $800,000 and $850,000 per home. Our balance sheet and access to liquidity remain strong. We ended FY 2015 with $929 million of cash and marketable securities and $566 million available under our $1.035 billion, 15-bank revolving credit facility. Our net debt-to-capital ratio* was 39.5%. In our fourth quarter, we raised $350 million of 10-year debt in the public capital markets at a rate of 4.875%. The various initiatives we have pursued over the past several years to diversify the Company, both geographically and by product mix, are starting to pay dividends. While the Boston-to-Washington, DC, corridor, where we have a dominant presence in the luxury market, still represents the greatest concentration of wealth in the United States, other markets have also appealed to our high-end residential customers. This is attributable to many factors and differentiated locational characteristics, such as technology industry concentration, job creation, attractive climate, immigration trends, and lifestyle alternatives. Our growth in California, New York City, and Texas, our entry into Seattle, the geographic

expansion of our active-adult product, and the growth of our Apartment Living division are all responses to the diversified appetite of our customers and our ability to capitalize on new opportunities. We believe this diversity and flexibility, coupled with our national brand, should all contribute to our continued success. The expansion in California that was jump-started by our acquisition of Shapell Homes in February 2014, as well as the purchase of a number of other premier properties over the past several years, has proven well-timed. Our contracts and fiscal year-end backlog in dollars in California grew by 93% and 195% in FY 2015 from a year ago, with our average price of homes in backlog reaching $1.5 million at the end of FY 2015. Our rental apartment business continues to outperform our expectations. We are managing two stabilized communities of over 1,400 units, and leasing up four new communities of over 1,500 units--one in Washington, DC, one in suburban Philadelphia, our first student housing community at the University of Maryland, and a 417-unit, 38-story tower in Jersey City. We are currently in construction on three other rental communities totaling approximately 1,000 units and have nearly 3,500 additional units in our pipeline stretching from Massachusetts to Atlanta. We plan to expand this business nationally. Our City Living for-sale condominiums business is also performing well. We are currently offering condominiums in nine projects totaling 918 units in New York City, Hoboken,

Philadelphia, and Bethesda, just outside Washington, DC. We have an attractive pipeline of future deals totaling 1,180 units in various stages of design and approval, and we continue to explore expansion beyond our current markets. Since 1970, the nation has averaged housing starts of 1.6 million homes annually. With nationwide housing starts signaling about 1.1 million in 2015, the industry still has a lot of runway ahead even to reach its average historical production volumes. According to the Federal Reserve, homeowner equity has doubled since 2011, the start of the housing recovery, and is now approaching pre-downturn levels. With the economy still improving and home equity growing, we believe our future should be bright. In 2015 we were named by Fortune magazine as The Most Admired Company in the Homebuilding Sector and America's Most Trusted Home BuilderTM by Lifestory Research based on a survey of 43,200 home shoppers in 27 markets. These honors are a tribute to the tremendous effort of our entire team at Toll Brothers. As the year ends, we thank our colleagues for their dedication and hard work.
