A MODEL YEAR
OÕREILLY AUTOMOTIVE 2001 ANNUAL REPORT
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
Over generations, our Company has built a strong track record of growth and performance by pursuing our mission of being the dominant supplier of auto parts in our markets. 2001 was no exception. With more than 12,500 dedicated team members having a strong focus on customer service, work ethic and our prominent culture, Team OÕReilly has completed a Model Year.
In 1998, we embarked on a vision for growth called 1-5-U. It represented our mission to reach $1 billion in sales in five years. We are proud to announce that once again Team OÕReilly has risen to the challenge, meeting this goal one year early. This demonstrates the commitment of our team members and their ability to excel beyond expectations.
In late 2001, OÕReilly seized a tremendous opportunity with our acquisition of Mid-State Automotive Distributors, Inc. The acquisition provided strategic and contiguous growth for our Company throughout seven additional states, added 82 net new stores, two distribution centers and over 1,800 new experienced team members. In addition to our acquisition of Mid-State,
we added 121 new stores, bringing our total store count to
875 throughout 16 states.
We continue to make improvements in our use of technology. Our Global Inventory System has increased the availability of parts to our customers by giving our stores visibility to inventory at all distribution centers and other stores. This system also reduces inventory levels at both stores and distribution centers.
We continue to find new ways to utilize TeamNet, our intranet system and reduce the cost associated with printed materials while improving communications with our stores.
A lot of hard work by Team OÕReilly produced another year of strong financial results. Product sales of $1.09 billion,an increase of 22.7%, a 10.4% operating margin and net income growth of 26.0% highlight this Model Year. Approximately 56% of product sales were generated from the do-it-yourself or retail trade,
and approximately 44% of product sales were generated from the professional installer market. We continue our focus on this dual-market strategy with a goal of 50% from each market.
OÕReilly has positioned itself for the opportunities ahead. Our plans for 2002 include opening at least 100 new stores and same store sales objectives in the mid single-digit range. We will continue to leverage our technology investment in the area of inventory control. Our goal is to achieve inventory turns of 1.7 times, an operating margin of 11% or greater and top line sales growth of approximately 18-20%.
We look forward to taking the opportunities that lie ahead in 2002 and converting them to shareholder value. Team OÕReilly has a successful track record of responding to these opportunities
as we strive to be the dominant auto part supplier in our markets. Thank you for taking time to learn more about Team OÕReilly and for your continued support and confidence.
