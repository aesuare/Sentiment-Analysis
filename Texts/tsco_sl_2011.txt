To Our Stakeholders:
2011 marked another year of exceptional performance for Tractor Supply, as we again achieved record results. Today, Tractor Supply is operating as a much more agile company. We are quite simply planning and executing better than ever before. At the same time, we are enthused about the opportunities that lie ahead, and we believe we are well-prepared to seize these opportunities. A year ago, we wrote to you about the Retail Engine (our strategic road map) powering Tractor Supply's success. We believe the momentum we have experienced in our business is a direct result of the four key flywheels of this engine spinning at a much faster pace. The flywheels are: Team Member Loyalty, Customer Loyalty, Vendor Loyalty and Shareholder Loyalty. Driving the engine is a culture of values, ethics, trust and collaboration; and the underpinning of the engine is a dedication to low cost and efficiency.

EXAMPLES OF THIS MOMENTUM IN 2011 INCLUDED
Revenue and income: We grew revenue 16% to a record $4.23 billion. Net income increased nearly 33% to $223 million. Same-store sales: Our same-store sales increased 8.2% on top of the prior year's 7.0% increase. Operating margin: Operating margin improved 100 basis points to a company-record 8.3% following a 130 basis point improvement in 2010. We are still in the early stages of several of our key gross margin initiatives. In fact, we recently announced an increase in our long-term operating margin target from 8.5% to 9.5%. Earnings per share: We grew earnings per share by more than 30% for a second consecutive year, to a company-record of $3.01 per diluted share in 2011. Cash flow: In 2011, we generated $254 million in cash from operating activities and ended the year with nearly $199 million in cash on the balance sheet. The Company continues to fund its store growth and business investments internally through strong cash flow.

Capital allocation: In 2011, Tractor Supply increased its quarterly cash dividend by 71%, from $0.07 per share to $0.12 per share. The Company also continued to return value to shareholders in 2011, spending a record $180 million of its cash to repurchase shares. Same-store transaction count: Comparable transaction count grew 5.0% in 2011 on top of the prior year's 7.4% increase. The company has now achieved 15 consecutive quarters of year-over-year same-store transaction increases. Store growth: We opened 85 new stores in 2011, bringing our total store count to 1,085 locations in 44 states. We believe we still have a long runway of growth ahead of us. Over the past four years, we have tested and effectively validated that our store model is viable in smaller markets and, thus, have recently increased our domestic Tractor Supply opportunity from 1,800 stores to 2,100 stores. In working toward this goal, we will continue to target annual square footage growth of approximately 8%, which we have demonstrated is a very manageable pace of growth for us.

STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BUSINESS
We believe the momentum in our business is also a direct reflection of the traction we have been gaining from structural improvements made in recent years. CUSTOMER LOYALTY At the onset of the recession, we recognized that consumer shopping behaviors were changing. Customers began: 1) paying more frequently with cash, checks and debit cards rather than credit cards, 2) declining opportunities to apply for new credit cards, and 3) postponing or deferring discretionary purchases while focusing more on repair and replacement parts. At that time, Tractor Supply made a firm commitment to better meet our customers' evolving needs, through superior customer service and improved product availability. Our unwavering goal has been to help our customers by providing exceptional quality and value, while saving them time and money. We have been rewarded in this commitment through our improving customer service scores and customer loyalty. STORE TRAFFIC In 2008, we launched an initiative to intensify our focus on consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products in an effort to drive increased frequency of customer visits. These are items customers purchase on a regular basis to care for their home, land, pets and animals. This initiative drove business throughout the recession and continues to be an integral part of our overall strategy. At the same time, while C.U.E. products continue to perform, we are very pleased that we are experiencing broad-based sales strength across most of the major categories in our stores. EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING In 2011, the Company spent $56 million on advertising, or 1.32% of sales. Five years ago, in 2006, the Company spent $53 million on advertising, or 2.25% of sales. Store traffic has continued to grow, even as we reduced advertising spend as a percent of sales each year for the past five years. This is a true testament to the strength of our core business and the effectiveness of our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) program. We are benefiting from more targeted market research and are more informed to anticipate our customers' preferences, allowing us to more proactively meet their needs. We continue to enhance our marketing research initiatives and believe that we can continue to benefit from our efforts to further refine print distribution and leverage our CRM program over time. REDUCED EXPOSURE TO WEATHER TRENDS We have taken several steps to effectively mitigate our business exposure to weather trends. For instance, the Tractor Supply store footprint is much more geographically dispersed today, with 1,085 stores in 44 states. We have also been more effective in anticipating weather conditions and planning inventories accordingly. Today, we are more nimble and have the ability to adjust our merchandise mix in many situations to overcome and take advantage of weather trends.

CONTINUED FOCUS ON PLANNING AND EXECUTION
We believe we have considerable opportunity ahead and remain intensely focused on collaborative, consistent execution from our team members and our vendors. The rigorous strategic planning process that we employ is a key to our preparedness in this regard. Our annual five-year strategic planning process begins in May and concludes with a presentation to our Board of Directors in October. During this process, the executive team dedicates one day each month to the development and refinement of our strategic plan. This rigorous and iterative strategic plan is then cascaded to all teams and linked to department and individual performance goals. It is an integral part of the Tractor Supply foundation, as a guiding road map against which we execute each and every day.

LOOKING AHEAD
Looking ahead to 2012, we believe we have the right plans in place to drive results and further build our brand. However, we firmly believe that every process within our business can and will be improved over time. We believe these improvements will continue to contribute to the positive momentum we have built in our business.
