American Airlines 2001 Annual Report

In recent years, I have had the pleasure, and the honor ­ in my role as Chairman and CEO of AMR ­ to highlight in these pages the achievements of our Company during the preceding year. In some respects, 2001 was like most other years ­ the American Airlines and American Eagle teams rose to meet incredible challenges, and from a strategic standpoint, we did quite a bit to position our airline for long-term competitive success. But as everyone knows, 2001 was not just another year. It was a year that brought enormous pain and unprecedented challenges to our country, to our industry and certainly to AMR Corporation. For American Airlines, every accomplishment, indeed every other event, was overshadowed by the twin calamities of the September 11 attacks and the loss of Flight 587 in Queens, New York, on November 12. Prior to September 11, our company's greatest obstacle had been the slowing U.S. economy, which triggered a substantial decline in air travel generally, and business travel in particular. The previously stable relationship between industry supply and demand deteriorated badly, and as revenues fell, many of our costs continued to rise. As a consequence, AMR posted significant losses in the first half of the year. The September 11 attacks turned a difficult year into a catastrophe. The nation's aviation system was completely shut down for several days. And though we were able to handle a slew of new security-related operational demands and get our airline up and running again, passenger traffic for the entire industry was dramatically lower. In the days and weeks following the attacks, we acted quickly by reducing our capacity to get supply and demand better aligned. When we fly less, we need fewer aircraft, so we also hastened the retirement of many older aircraft, while eliminating others through lease returns. All told, we removed about 70 aircraft from our fleet. And as we ratcheted down capacity, we also focused very hard on reducing both capital spending and operating expenses. Earlier in the year, in response to the weakening revenue environment, we removed close to $1 billion from our 2001-2002 capital plan. In the post-9/11 environment, we took that initiative quite a bit further by drastically reducing capital spending for aircraft and non-aircraft items. In terms of our fleet, we deferred 35 of the 45 firm 2002 deliveries until sometime beyond 2003. We also made significant cutbacks in our non-essential aircraft modifications, scaled back facilities projects in a number of cities, cut our information technology development budget and drastically cut spending on ground equipment and training simulators. All told, we were able to

remove another $2.5 billion from our capital plan ­ on top of the $1 billion we cut earlier. As a result, our capital spending for 2001 was approximately $3.6 billion, and we expect it to be just $1.8 billion in 2002. Our capital controls have been complemented by our myriad expense-reduction efforts, which include: trimming in-flight amenities, closing most of our city ticket offices and some lesser-used airport lounges and cutting back on advertising and promotions, information technology and corporate overhead. We have also been able to negotiate some meaningful cost reductions with many of our suppliers. None of these initiatives were particularly pleasant, but worst of all, in the face of staggering losses we took the painful step of reducing our workforce by the equivalent of 20,000 jobs. Fortunately, through creative and collaborative work on the part of our management team and union leaders, we were able to mitigate at least some of the effect on our people through initiatives like voluntary leaves, job sharing, military leaves and reductions in overtime. Controlling both capital spending and operating costs was, and is, a critically important part of our efforts to rebuild our Company. Moreover, our determination to prudently manage our balance sheet in recent years paid off in a big way as we sought a cash cushion to help weather the storm of late 2001. For some time, AMR had a sizeable undrawn bank line, which we drew down shortly after September 11. In the days following, we were also able to complete a deal that provided $1.9 billion in secured financing. And, during 2001, we received $730 million from the government as part of the Airline Stabilization Act passed in September. We expect to receive another $130 million in 2002. All that leaves us with a balance sheet which, relative to the rest of the industry, remains strong. We ended 2001 with about $3 billion in cash and a large stockpile of unencumbered aircraft assets we can draw upon, if necessary. Nonetheless, the losses we incurred for the year were staggering. The net loss of about $1.8 billion in 2001, which includes a loss of $800 million for the fourth quarter alone, dwarfed any previous year's loss. 2001 was a painful year for all three of our major constituency groups. We lost many valued customers, friends and colleagues on both September 11 and November 12. For many others, the joy of flight has been dampened, at least temporarily. Thousands of AMR employees lost their jobs, and all of us were deeply troubled by the attacks on our country. Customers and employees alike have had to make some dramatic adjustments to deal with the new security requirements of the post-9/11 world. And of course, our shareholders have taken a tremendous hit, as AMR shares fell significantly in the aftermath of the September attacks. And yet, despite all the bad news, 2001 ­ which, among other things, marked our company's 75th anniversary ­ did contain a number of important highlights and milestones. In April, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Trans World Airlines (TWA), and in the months that followed, our people ­ despite all the aforementioned problems in our business ­ completed the biggest, the most complex, and the most successful integration of two airlines in the history of our industry. The TWA acquisition was a huge step forward for our domestic network, and it made American Airlines, once again, the largest airline in the world. The More Room Throughout Coach campaign, which we launched in 2000, gained real traction in 2001, giving us an important point of differentiation versus the rest of the industry. In February 2002, American completed the implementation of More Room, which included the flawless reconfiguration of more than 850 aircraft and the removal of about 9,000 seats from AA and TWA jets. Despite the massive changes of late 2001, our people never took their eyes off the ball when it came to providing high quality customer service. In fact, as the year drew to a close, American's on-time performance steadily improved. I'm pleased to report that this momentum carried over into the first months of 2002 as American climbed to within an eyelash of the top spot in on-time performance in January. At the airports, in our reservations centers and indeed throughout our Company, our people are creatively applying new technologies to streamline processes, generate

revenue, reduce costs and improve the customer experience. And while our recent financial performance has caused us to shelve, at least temporarily, some technology-related initiatives, we are nonetheless committed to leading the industry when it comes to the development and application of technology on behalf of our customers, shareholders and employees. As we begin 2002, we face a business environment and an industry landscape that has been dramatically altered during the past year. But as we learned in 2001, the values and principles that have guided our Company through the past three quarters of a century are as solid as ever ­ and the change swirling around us makes sticking to those principles all the more important. One principle that served us well in 2002 was the flexibility we built into our plans during the prosperous years of the mid-to-late-1990s. By not over-leveraging our balance sheet, and by consciously keeping our fleet plans as flexible as possible, we were better positioned to respond to the catastrophic events of late 2001. Despite all that's happened, the six tenets of our Airline Leadership Plan ­ Safety, Service, Product, Network, Technology and Culture ­ remain our blueprint for industry leadership. While individual strategies within those broad categories must evolve, we are as convinced as ever that the only way to create the best possible outcomes for all of our constituencies is by leading the airline industry in all six. That's the goal we are determined to achieve. Underlying that goal is the need to establish and sustain strong relationships. Indeed, we could not have emerged from 2001 intact were it not for the support of the government, the communities we serve, our suppliers, our airline partners, the financial community and, most of all, the people of American Airlines and American Eagle. At the same time, it is distressing to note that not all of our relationships within the Company have lived up to our standards. While we have made company-wide progress in the area of diversity, we have seen pockets of resistance similar to those that other companies have experienced. Even isolated reports of harassment within our various workgroups are cause for concern. To eliminate this behavior and capitalize on the benefits of a diverse workforce, I have directed managers throughout the Company to clearly articulate our zero-tolerance policies as they relate to discrimination and harassment. In fact, we have rewritten and strengthened those policies to make it clear that we will terminate people for unacceptable behavior. We have also asked four members of our Board of Directors ­ Earl Graves, Judith Rodin, Armando Codino and Roger Staubach ­ to monitor our progress and help us maintain our position of cultural leadership within the industry. We are equally resolved to making travel on American Airlines as safe and secure as it can possibly be, while at the same time doing all we can with tools such as airport automation and premium queues at security checkpoints to help our customers get through the airport more quickly. We firmly believe that air travel can be both safe and convenient, and we are working actively with the Air Transport Association and the Transportation Security Administration to achieve that goal. Nothing we do is more important than ensuring the safety of air travel for our customers and our employees. Finally, our discussion of 2001 would not be complete without acknowledging the leadership and contributions of Charles Pistor who joined the AMR and American Airlines Boards of Directors in 1982 and retired in 2001. As we begin 2002 there are some hopeful signs on the horizon. In fact, as of this writing we have ­ in response to a steady increase in passenger and cargo traffic ­ begun slowly adding back some of the capacity we withdrew in the fall of 2001. In the months to come, we will take full advantage of the addition of TWA to our network. That, along with our much-improved dependability and the fully implemented More Room product, ought to give us a leg up in the even-tougher-than-usual competition for each airline customer. With a strong balance sheet, a premium brand image, a powerful network and steadily

improving operational performance, I believe AMR is ready to meet whatever challenges await us in 2002. But more important than any of those factors are the men and women of our Company. As employees, as human beings, our people were put through more in 2001 than any of us could possibly have imagined a year ago. And yet the dignity, the strength and the grace they exhibited as we started rebuilding the airline are something I'll never forget. As a colleague, I am humbled by it. I know I speak for all of us on the senior management team when I say we will be doing our best ­ in 2002 and beyond ­ to live up to the example they have set for us. Sincerely, Donald J. Carty Chairman, President and CEO Back to top
