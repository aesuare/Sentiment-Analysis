MEASUREMENT IS CENTRAL TO PROGRESSIVE’S BUSINESS DISCIPLINE. We findways to measure just about everything. Crafting an accurate measure to summarize overallcompany performance is perhaps hardest of all, but we have such a measure.“Gainshare” is our way to calibrate the business gain made in any calendar year.Expressed as a score between 0 and 2 with calculation details that belie the simplisticscale, Gainshare has for over 12 years provided an internal barometer of performance,as well as variable compensation for all Progressive people. In the bleak year of 2000,the score was 0 and no Gainsharing compensation was paid. In 2003, when things couldnot have gone much better, the score was the first ever 2. While neither of these resultswas anticipated as likely in the distribution of outcomes, both served to validate thepossibilities. Over the last 12 years, the average score has been 1.4, exceeding the expectedoutcome of achieving our stated objectives which by design would produce a 1.0.Although 2005 was not a year of record setting growth rates or earnings per share, byour Gainshare score of 1.54, or by any other measure, it was a very solid all-aroundperformance. We ended the year with just over $14 billion in net premiums written, anincrease of about $630 million, or 5%over 2004. This is the smallest gain of the last fiveyears in both absolute and percentage terms, but not out of sync with our expectations orour forecast of industry-wide auto premiums for 2005. Our calendar-year underwritingprofit margin remained exceptionally strong at 11.9%, considerably above our target of4%, but down from prior-year levels by about 3 points. Combined with investmentreturns for the year, net income for 2005 was $1.39 billion, yielding a return on averageshareholders’ equity of 25%.{Letter to Shareholders }.09| || ||||| | || || ||| ||||||||| | || || | || || | || ||| || ||||| | || || ||| ||||||||| | || || | || || | || ||.109095100105110115197619801985199019952000(est.)2005MARKET CONDITIONSWith some good reason, the cyclical nature of insurance is oftencited when describing market conditions and industry performance.The inset graph provides a visual reference to the surprisinglyconsistent nature of the private passenger auto cycle. Overthe past 30 years, we have seen enormous political and economicchanges, along with dramatic swings in interest rates and equitymarketreturns. Despite these changes, the cycle shows a consistentpattern. It would appear that over the past few years, we havebeen observing the ascent, peak and now the potential decline inunderwriting margins of the current cycle.Last year I reported that consistently falling claims frequencymade 2003 and 2004 two of only three profitable years in the last25 for the auto insurance industry and that 2004 produced whatwas at that time perhaps the lowest industry-wide combined ratioin history. As most would have assumed, 2005 was to be anotheryear of underwriting profitability and, while significant, even thelosses from the storm season are unlikely to dramatically changethe macro cycle.For Progressive, understanding this cycle translates intoplaying the right hand at the right time.About one full cycle ago, the industry was reporting peak underwritingprofitability. In 1998, Progressive reported a healthyunderwriting profit of 8.4%, but our growth was slowing. OurPRIVATE PASSENGER AUTO COMBINED RATIOS1976 – 2005Source: A.M. Best Company Inc.culture thrives on profitable growth, and slowing growth doesnot sit well at any level in the organization — now or then.We responded with price reductions in the hope of additionalprofitable growth. These reductions, combined with an unanticipatedincrease in claim frequency and severity and a host of othercontributing factors, decreased our underwriting profit to 1.7%in 1999 and led to an underwriting loss of 4.4% in 2000.In our own small way we contributed to the cycle. As wereview today’s market conditions there are reasons to respect theparallels to that time. We are more experienced, but imperfect,in valuing the benefit of rate reductions during market conditionsin which consumers experience rate stability or decreases.As such, we have chosen to be more deliberate in using ratereductions in search of profitable growth. Drive Insurance, whichoperates in an environment where rates are continuously comparedto competitive options, reduced rates modestly during theyear and found it very hard to get growth in new applications.Progressive Direct kept rates relatively stable for the year and wasable to grow new applications, albeit at a pace far less than wecould have handled and would have preferred.Change in market pricing is reflected in year-over-year growthin net premiums written for the auto insurance industry. In2004, the year-over-year growth in net premiums written fell to.11| || ||||| | || || ||| ||||||||| | || || | || || | || ||4.2% from the prior three-year average of 8%. For 2005, weestimate the year-over-year increase in net premiums writtenfor the auto insurance industry will be about 1%. Our knowledgeof the calculus combining price, growth and profit,while increasing, remains a challenge and something we want tobe smart about.Reviewing Progressive’s and the industry’s results through 2005and noting the possible analogue to past cycles, we would make afew important observations. Operating margins, while historicallystrong, are starting to deteriorate. Modestly increasing severity,notably in physical damage coverages, combined with pricereductions, will likely reduce current margins. Prior period bodilyinjury severities, which have the highest sensitivity to carriedreserves, have generally been overestimated resulting in favorablecalendar-period adjustments. In Progressive’s case, the overallfavorable calendar-year adjustment was 2.6 points for 2005.Calendar-period reporting has a way of disguising the run rate andperhaps delaying appropriate reactions. We have for some timeforecast that Progressive would slowly return to more normaloperating margins by allowing expected increases in severity, andpotentially frequency, to absorb the margin in excess of our targetrather than immediately price it away. We continue to believe thisis the right way for us to address these market conditions.We see 2006 as a year when accident-year results both forProgressive and the industry may begin producing smaller marginsand trending toward more historical norms. As with any outlookthere are unknowns. The level of price activity and thedegree of severity and frequency change will be critical as we playour hand during this phase of the cycle.History has been an influential teacher and as we work throughthis phase of the cycle many things are different and, we think, betterfor us. Our personal auto policy periods are shorter, providinggreater flexibility to price correctly and our controls and analyticreview of profitability by subsegments of our book are more rigorous.We are clearer about our expected outcomes. Loss cost andexpense management are all considerably tighter and our technologyand operational performance are considerably improved.While accepting that current market conditions will likelycontinue to influence our growth during 2006, and that growthwill be less than we believe we are ready to handle, we haveembraced this time and opportunity as one of “maximumpreparedness” for the future we anticipate.MAXIMUM PREPAREDNESSUnderwriting cycle aside, our future will largely be determinedby how we craft it, and we have many important initiatives thatcontinue to excite me. A slightly less glamorous way to describeourselves and our ability to compete would be to suggest we dothree things well that really matter. We allocate costs betweenconsumers in ways that best match their expected costs, we managethe claims and administrative costs that must ultimately beallocated, and we provide superior consumer experiences. Ourmaximum preparedness agenda is designed to encompass themany things we know matter in our business and to optimize ourperformance on a few very strategic initiatives that create meaningfuland, in some cases, distinctive competitive advantages..13| || ||||| | || || ||| ||||||||| | || || | || || | || ||Claims Our single largest cost and one of our most visibleconsumer experiences has continued to demonstrate steady andconsistent improvement. Our emphasis on claims handlingquality and critical review has again established a new high-watermark. While the rate of improvement, by definition, will slow,this is likely the single most important and sustained operationalimprovement of the last several years. Even more importantperhaps is that our claims quality improved in growth periodssuggesting, as we believe, claims quality is largely a functionof system-wide process design and effective implementation.We expect when margins thin the competitive benefits will bemore apparent.Last year, I reported that we used the year to fully evaluateevery aspect of our concierge-level claims service and concludedby year end that our evaluation discipline and planning hadpositioned us well for expansion throughout 2005 and 2006.We opened six new facilities in 2005 and ended the year with 18under construction. 2006 will be a big year with about 30 plannedopenings. As passionate and involved as I have been with thisinitiative, I continue to be surprised and impressed by the level ofdetail and science our people have built around the concept, andjust how critical that detail is to ensure success. My confidence inmore than doubling the number of sites in just one year reflectsthat we are now observing that each opening builds on the successof those before it and has a much abbreviated learning curve.Several years ago I suggested that this initiative would change ourbusiness in profound ways, improving the customer and employeeexperience, reducing the friction costs associated with claims handling,improving the interaction with body shops and leveragingscale advantages in meaningful ways. I am now more confidentthan ever and we have started to think more in terms of how notto deprive our customers of this level of service where we can offerit economically.A theme highlighted by this report is the significance and valueof time in a service economy. More than anything else the conciergelevel of service respects our customers’ and claimants’ time andworks effectively to minimize the cycle time of repairs, resultingin cost-management opportunities at every step of the process.Speaking of time, our claims responsiveness was once againput to the test in what appeared to be the never-ending stormseason of 2005. We have reported at length on the storms andtheir economic toll, but the real story is that, when tested, ourclaims organization’s ability to produce excellent closure ratesand great customer service was, we believe, second to none. Aby-product of a storm season of this year’s magnitude is that it islikely that more people than ever, in a concentrated period oftime, have experienced an insurance claim of one type or another.We intend to confirm our understanding of our performance byconducting an independent survey of Gulf States claims handling.Determining where we have room for improvement will be theonly assessment of long-term value. Timely response in this caseis not just great customer service, it’s good business. Respondingto customers quickly adds certainty to our external financialdisclosures as well as to the internal data we use for pricing.OPHELIAWILMAKATRINATAMMYCINDYRITAARLENEGAMMADENNISEMILYSTANJOSÉBETAFRANKLINIRENEBRETALPHAPHILLIPPEMARIAEPSILONNATELEEDELTAZETAIRENETENTWENTY-TWOHARVEYNINETEENSTORM TRACKING – 2005 SEASON| || ||||| | || || ||| ||||||||| | || || | || || | || ||.14While we are proud of our overall service and experiencedelivery, we can do better. Friendly fire, as we have seen, canresult from process breakdowns, poor quality control, actionsthat are generally applied that should be more targeted, failureto communicate as effectively as the situation deserves, and thelike. We are using more finely tuned statistical process controltools, numerous cause analysis methods and a heightened attentionto customer feedback in our efforts to take our customercare focus to a level consistent with our expectations. To increasethe speed, completeness and intensity of our self analysis ofcustomer experiences we have created a participation benefit forour employees to be both customers and critics. Eating our owncooking, combined with the Progressive culture to be “VirtuallyPerfect” in all we do, will unquestionably create some healthytension, but I have little doubt having more Progressive people asProgressive customers will be an effective catalyst as we continueto improve our product offerings and consumer experiences.Technology Advancing our technology interface with agents andconsumers and increasing internal functionality is a routine partof our individual business operations and is funded and managedas such. Our plans in each area are directed at long-termcost management and providing superior customer experiences.2006 promises to be another productive year. To add to ourongoing preparedness, we have two companywide initiativesunder way for which the next 18 months will be crucial. The firstis replacing the customer and policy management system that hasserved us well but is not consistent with our views of future needs.The second is adding a data center that will ensure that not onlyis capacity not constrained but that a very high level of systemavailability and disaster preparedness is assured.Marketing 2005 was the first full year operating with twodistinct brand offerings. Providing consumers the choice of bothan agent-distributed product, now sold as Drive® Insurance fromProgressive, and a direct-to-consumer product, ProgressiveDirectSM, is both exciting and important positioning for us. Eachbrand presents distinct challenges in product design, pricing andcompetitive focus. The power of this choice and positioning washighlighted for me when we entered New Jersey in Septemberand were able to announce the availability of two top-tennational brands, providing consumers with different and validchoices in how to buy their auto insurance. Significant opportunitiesexist for both brands to develop and improve but, with ayear behind us, the opportunities are starting to be realized andwe are encouraged by the potential.A notable and welcomed development for Progressive Directduring the year was the continued strong growth from customersinitiating and buying policies on the Internet. Our Web-basedactivities celebrated their ten-year anniversary in 2005 with someremarkable accomplishments, and as we look toward the nextdecade, we expect the changes to be equally profound.We are pleased with, and very committed to, our positioningof Progressive relative to Internet consumers and see tremendouspotential in everything we do to leverage our leadership further.The continuous enhancement of Internet features and capabilitiesin Agent and Direct quoting, customer service and claimsmanagement are all central to our preparedness plans.Retention and Customer Service Last year in this letter, I wrotethat we are at our best when challenged and that improvingretention is a challenge we have accepted. During a period inwhich price pressure appears to be a less significant reason forconsumers to switch, our overall retention measures have not extendedat a rate we might have expected. This has forced us toexamine the customer experiences we provide at ever-increasinglevels of granularity. We have not always liked what we’ve seen.Self diagnosis seems easy upon first blush, but to understand effectivelythe countless combinations of customer experiencesmakes the effort a significant commitment. In more cases thanwe would like, the cause of a less than perfect customer experienceis what we have called “friendly fire.”INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENTSolid growth in the economy and improving profits supported theequity markets in 2005 while “measured” interest rate increasesfrom the Federal Reserve pushed short-term rates higher to essentiallyflat with steady longer maturity yields. We took advantageof interest rate volatility during the year to shorten our portfolio’saverage maturity when rates were low and extend it when ratesincreased. We decreased our exposure to corporate and other nongovernmentissued bonds early in the year, believing the incrementalyield premium relative to U.S. treasury bonds was insufficientfor the risk taken. Our portfolio produced a 4% total returnin 2005 with equities tracking their benchmark and fixed-incomesecurities performing better than the general bond market..17| || ||||| | || || ||| ||||||||| | || || | || || | || ||Our long-standing and continuing position on capital managementis to repurchase shares when our capital position, view ofthe future, and the stock’s price make it attractive to do so.Growth rates and profitability levels during 2005 happily led toan assessment that we were accumulating capital in excess of thatwhich we believed was needed and prudent to run the business.Committed to executing against our capital management strategy,we entered 2005 with regular monthly share repurchases.The average repurchase price per share in January was $83.46,below the $88 of the “Dutch auction” we had completed justthree months earlier. By September our repurchase price was justunder $100. October and November saw rapid escalation in thestock price peaking near $125; while delighted for shareholders,this level of volatility suggested we should pause for a while,which we did before repurchasing again in December at $118.92.Progressive’s business model is designed to produce profitablegrowth over any reasonable period and support that growth fromunderwriting results. Based on our current market share and competitivepositioning, we see no significant constraints to this outlook.Internally, our Gainsharing measure, focused exclusivelyon underwriting performance, provides a significant degree ofself regulation to this objective. With this as a backdrop, we havechallenged ourselves to develop a more comprehensive view ofcapital husbandry that is more aligned with our business model.The most significant change we plan to implement is to our dividendpolicy. In 2007, we will replace modest quarterly dividendswith an annual variable dividend payable after the close of theyear. The special dividend will, absent extraordinary circumstances,be declared by the Board based on a Board-selected targetpercentage of after-tax underwriting profit, multiplied by thecompanywide Gainshare factor. The target percentage will be declaredprior to the start of the year and the Gainshare score, between0 and 2, will be reported each month as it develops. Thisadds a significant dimension to our ability to return capital toshareholders in balance with performance and our expected futurecapital needs. In addition, it provides for an ownershipproposition well aligned with companywide performance managementincentives. We have stress tested this concept using a20% target and actual Gainshare scores for the last decade andare convinced it produces the desired outcomes of returningcapital to owners in periods in which we do not requireadditional capital and retaining capital when we can effectivelydeploy it in the business. Using 2005 performance as an example,the dividend payable in early 2006 would have been $1.66per share versus $0.12 under the current dividend policy. Whilethis change provides a means for a more consistent capital distributionwhen appropriate to do so, we are still committed to ourrepurchase activity as an important part of our immediate andlong-term capital management. At a minimum, we will continueto neutralize dilution from equity-based compensation, in theyear of issuance, through share repurchases. With this additionto our capital management tool set, we believe we will be muchbetter suited to deal with the range of outcomes from ourbusiness model and create suitable flexibility for owners undervarying tax environments.We have for some time included in our Financial Policies thatwe will split the stock when the share price exceeds $100 for a reasonableperiod of time. We last split the stock 3:1 in April 2002.As I write this letter, we are approaching a time when bothconditions have been met, and I expect our Board of Directorswill vote on such an action during their meeting immediatelyfollowing the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in April. Wecurrently do not have enough authorized shares to providesignificant flexibility in considering a range of split scenarios andhave placed a request for increased authorization before the shareholders.We have attempted to study many factors to determinewhether splitting the stock and having it trade in a price rangemore consistent with the market as a whole is an appropriate thingto do. Our work in this area is not definitive, but we are now lesssure that forecasting parameters of any future split is importantto our capital management philosophy. Therefore, we will removethat commitment from our Financial Policies going forward.USE OF GAINSHARE TO ALIGN SHAREHOLDER AND EMPLOYEE INTERESTS[ ] [ ] [ ][ ] [ ]xEmployee paidx eligible earnings Employee GS payoutShareholder GS TargetAnnual after-taxunderwriting income x== Shareholder GS payout[ Em p loy ee GS Targets ][ Ga in sha re (GS) ]factor>>| || ||||| | || || ||| ||||||||| | || || | || || | || ||.18CONSTANCY OF PURPOSEJust as measurement is central to Progressive’s business discipline,our Core Values, aspirations and people are central to ourbusiness culture.We are continuously motivated by our aspiration of becomingConsumers’ #1 Choice for Auto Insurance and in 2005 movedanother step closer, ending the year with close to 10 millionpolicies and enormous potential. Nothing we have achieved hasbeen without the efforts of so many and our single mostimportant initiative continues to be making Progressive a GreatPlace to Work. Creating an environment where our people enjoyworking hard, are motivated to do their best, can grow constantlyand one that others want to join is a never-ending focus andhas a special permanency. Our measures of the culture andwork environment provide us both confidence and challenge inour efforts to ensure the Progressive culture continuously matchesour aspirations.We greatly appreciate the customers we are privileged toserve, the more than 28,000 Progressive people who make it allpossible, the agents and brokers who choose to represent us andshareholders who believe in what we are doing.Glenn M.
