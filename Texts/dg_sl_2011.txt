      To Our Fellow Shareholders, Customers, and Employees
As you read this annual report, you will see that 2011 proved to be another year of significant accomplishments for Dollar General. From a financial perspective, we achieved record sales, operating profit, net income and cash flow from operations. We exceeded our financial targets while also investing in our future.
Financial highlights of 2011 (a 53-week year) include the following:
• Net sales increased by 13.6% to $14.8 billion, or $213 per square foot.
• Same-store sales grew 6.0%, marking our 22nd consecutive year of same-store sales growth.
• Operating profit increased by 17.0% to $1.5 billion, or 10.1% of sales, a new record resulting from our strong sales and disciplined expense controls.
• Cash flow from operating activities increased by 27.4% to $1.05 billion.
• We reduced our outstanding long-term obligations by $670 million reflecting the redemption of the entire outstanding balance of our 10.625% senior notes.
• We reported net income of $767 million, or $2.22 per diluted share.
• And, we repurchased 4.9 million shares of our common stock.
Dollar General’s mission of “Serving Others” has never been more relevant than it is today. We are opening our doors more often to the increasing numbers of consumers who need to save on their everyday essentials and those who appreciate the value and convenience of shopping at our stores. As planned, in 2011, we expanded our offerings of health and beauty products and frozen and refrigerated food items. We emphasized our great values at the $1 price point, reinforcing Dollar General’s leadership role in the “dollar” segment, and at the same time, we served our customers better in areas such as party supplies, housewares, domestics and children’s apparel. Our efforts to ensure that our stores stay in-stock with the items our customers want have started to pay off, driving higher sales and improved customer satisfaction.
We opened 625 new stores in 2011, opening our doors for the first time to customers in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Nevada. In 2012, we plan to open an additional 625 new stores, including 50 in California, expanding our presence from coast to coast. We opened 12 new Dollar General Market stores in 2011, our first new Market stores since 2007, and we
plan to add 40 more in 2012 in communities where we have the opportunity to better serve our customers’ needs with expanded grocery options.
The key to opening new doors for our customers is our employees, and as we continue to grow, we are opening new doors for them as well. Led by a strong retail leadership team, our 90,000 talented and dedicated employees represent Dollar General every day in over 10,000 neighborhoods and communities across the U.S. In 2011 alone, we added 4,000 net new jobs, and over 55% of all open management positions were filled through internal placements. We are making significant strides in providing our store managers more information. We have upgraded our technology to help them be more effective in their jobs and more successful in their careers.
Finally, 2011 was another great year of giving back to our communities. Most significantly, the Dollar General Literacy Foundation which we support alongside our customers, vendors and friends, contributed more than $12 million in support of community efforts to open new doors of opportunity for those who need help with their reading skills or learning English as a second language.
We are proud of our commitment to the mission of “Serving Others,” and it is by adherence to this mission that we have been successful in opening new doors for our shareholders, customers, fellow employees and the many communities we serve. As we continue to invest in our future, I remain confident that we can successfully execute our 2012 plans and continue to deliver long-term sustainable growth.
We are looking forward to another rewarding year in 2012 and to updating you on our continued success. Thank you for your ongoing support of Dollar General.
Kindest regards,
Rick Dreiling
