Letter to Our Shareholders

Fiscal 2010 was a year of significant debate in the external environment surrounding the regulatory rulemaking process for the U.S. postsecondary education system, but it was also a year of tremendous progress for Apollo Group and our stakeholders, as we continued to execute on our long-term strategic plan.
We are committed to strengthening and capitalizing on Apollo Group's position as a leading provider of high quality, accessible education for individuals around the world. This means putting the student first as we focus on academic quality and the student experience. To that end, we are intensely focused on leveraging our core capabilities and expertise--developed over our 35-plus year history--to, first and foremost, maximize the long-term value of University of Phoenix, which is our top investment priority for Apollo Group, and then, to expand intelligently beyond University of Phoenix. For University of Phoenix, this means: 1)  Growing our business the right way by better identifying and attracting students who are willing to put in the effort to succeed and who we believe can benefit from our programs; 2)  Delivering a high-value, energizing and compelling learning experience to our students through quality, convenient and relevant academic programs, engaging instruction, innovative content delivery, and student-centric services and protections; and 3) Increasing the efficiency of our operations through scalability and process innovation. Beyond University of Phoenix, one of our most exciting initiatives is the work we are doing to create a global education network through the educational institutions of Apollo Global. By leveraging the organizational knowledge, capabilities and systems resident at Apollo Group and applying that knowledge to our sister institutions, we have the opportunity to reach a broad population of students across the large and growing global education sector over the years to come.

A year in review. In fiscal 2010, Apollo Group delivered consolidated revenue of $4.9 billion, a 25 percent increase over the prior year, and net income from continuing operations attributable to Apollo was $568.4 million, or $3.72 per diluted share. Importantly, it was a year in which we made several key strategic decisions aimed at enhancing the student experience and, over time, improving student outcomes. Implementation of several of these initiatives will result in a period of transition but should position the Company for more sustainable growth and greater predictability over time.
Over the course of the past year, much of the debate amongst policymakers--and the corresponding media coverage--has primarily centered on ensuring that institutions in the proprietary segment of the U.S. postsecondary education system are employing the appropriate scope and approach to their marketing practices, delivering a quality education to students, and ensuring that students are not overly burdened with debt. These objectives are ones that we share. We take seriously our responsibility as one of the leading universities in the country, and believe we are in a position to be a leader in developing and implementing positive industry practices as well as student protections.

Growing our business the right way. During fiscal 2010, we continued to enhance our approach to marketing and developing sophisticated tools to better identify students with the greatest likelihood of success in our programs. This approach has resulted in a notable reduction in the use of third-party lead generators over the last few years, which has allowed us to maintain better control over student messaging and to ensure accurate information is being provided to students. Our intent is to enhance control surrounding our marketing practices to ensure that students are fully and fairly informed about the education options available to them, as well as the potential costs and benefits of an education.
Also in fiscal 2010, we conducted an evaluation of our enrollment practices and procedures, resulting in comprehensive changes in the evaluation and compensation systems for our admissions personnel, including the elimination of any tie between compensation and enrollment results. We designed and are implementing for fiscal 2011 a system that allows our admissions personnel to more fully develop relationships with prospective and current students to more effectively support them as they pursue their educational goals. We are empowering our employees to provide outstanding service to students during the admissions process. During fiscal 2010, we also piloted a free, three-week program called University Orientation for students with limited college experience, which is designed to help a student determine if college--and specifically University of Phoenix--is right for them prior to their enrolling and possibly taking on debt. While this initiative will reduce the number of new students enrolling at the University as it is fully implemented in fiscal 2011, we expect to see improved student satisfaction and improved student outcomes, including better retention rates and ultimately higher graduation rates. Together, these efforts are focused on better identifying and admitting the right students into the right programs so that they have a higher likelihood of success.

As a result of quality academic programs, qualified faculty, and a comprehensive student experience, Apollo Group's schools are respected institutions of higher education. University of Phoenix holds regional accreditation, considered to be the gold standard of Revenue ( $ in billions ) accreditation, as well as programmatic accreditations $ 4.0 in $4.0 nursing, counseling, business and education. Apollo Group's other schools and institutions 3.0 throughout the world are also accredited by various local accrediting bodies within their 2.0 respective geographic or programmatic areas of instruction.

Delivering a high-value, energizing and compelling learning experience to our students. During fiscal 2010, University of Phoenix produced nearly 100,000
graduates in the critical areas of teaching, nursing, criminal justice and business, among others. Our students historically have seen salary improvement that exceeds national averages while enrolled in their degree programs, and they leave with student debt levels comparable to national averages of independent private four-year institutions. Importantly, our graduates have extremely low default rates on their student loans.

During fiscal 2010, we increased our training of financial counselors and developed financial literacy tools aimed at helping students make more informed financial decisions and to help our students maximize the value of their education. These have included enhanced transparency of total program and anticipated borrowing costs. We also implemented a responsible borrower tool that has resulted in a meaningful decline in the number of students who take out the maximum allowable amount of debt. We continue to invest heavily in our students' education as well as student services. To further enhance the learning experience and ultimately deliver academic content to more students more effectively, we continued to invest in a next-generation learning platform during 2010. Parts of this new platform, including our PhoenixConnectSM online community that connects faculty, students and alumni in an academically focused social network, were launched in recent months, while other components of the platform and adaptive learning 5 technologies are expected to be delivered over the course of fiscal 2011 and beyond. We recognize that the various student-focused initiatives that we have designed and tested during fiscal 2010 and are 3 implementing in fiscal 2011 will result in a period of transition. We expect these initiatives to have a significant impact on both our enrollment metrics and financial results during the transition; however, we believe these actions are the right things to do for our students, and 2 importantly, we are confident that over time they will solidify our leadership role within the industry and put our organization on a path of more consistently delivering high quality growth.

As we undertake this transition, we intend to continue investing in the student experience and making investments in key areas to support our long-term objectives; however, we also 0 intend to more aggressively manage our cost structure to appropriately align it with our operating results. Our long-term strategic plan is aimed at helping address the unmet educational needs of tens of millions of American workers--and millions more internationally--who do not have, yet could benefit from, a postsecondary degree. If nations are to remain globally competitive, their 4.0 labor forces will need the education, skills and training to prepare them for the ever-changing 3.5 demands of today's global economy. Apollo Group provides practical, quality educational offerings that can help the U.S. and other countries meet their national educational goals. 3.0 As we address these opportunities in the U.S. and abroad, the initiatives we are undertaking 2.5 to support our strategic plan are aimed at aligning our people, technology and organizational 2.0 structure to effectively attract, engage, teach and service our students in order to maximize the returns on their education investment. We believe that providing this value proposition 1.5 and delivering a positive student experience will, in turn, drive returns for our shareholders.
