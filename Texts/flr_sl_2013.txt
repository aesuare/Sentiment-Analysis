2013 ANNUAL REPORT

DEAR VALUED UED SHAREHOLDERS
BLUEPRINT BL UEPRINT FOR FOR GROWTH GROWTH
Throughout 2013, Fluor focused on essential steps to building an even more competitive and profitable company--a trusted and admired company--that will withstand the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities that we see in the years ahead.

PLACING PLA CING OUR CLIENTS CLIENTS AT A THE CENTER OF ALL WE DO
Building on Fluor's culture and character to serve the needs of our clients
In the face of economic headwinds, changing markets and competitive pressures, we strengthened our ability to serve client expectations during 2013 by consolidating our sales and marketing assets--centered on meeting client needs from a "One Fluor" perspective. We also reinforced our reputation to serve our clients with integrity, reliability and quality. And we applied innovative thinking to provide solutions that answer complex engineering challenges, while bringing projects in on time and within budget. Fluor fully understands the value of a corporate brand. We treasure ours. And we protect and improve the equity we have created in our brand every day as we accomplish our work. We also truly believe that we are a part of the brand promise of our clients. We know that before our clients can achieve success, we have to design and build facilities that operate to clients' exacting standards--safely and reliably. In that regard, we continued to conduct our work in 2013 around a cornerstone of safety--a mainstay of Fluor's heritage and reputation. We also placed key executives in new roles, positioning businesses to achieve our strategic imperative to grow Fluor profitably. We expanded market presence and competitiveness through "One Fluor" selling opportunities that ensure our clients have access to the full range of Fluor's capabilities and expertise. And we charted a course in 2013 to take greater advantage of Fluor's unique and differentiating capabilities in the years ahead. We are focused on performing as the best of the best in client service, and measure our success by winning new work and by improving the overall profitability of our company.

OUR FINANCIALS
Creating value for our shareholders
Our financial results for 2013 met our expectations, and we continue to be especially encouraged by the significant and sustained progress of our Oil & Gas group. During the year, the Company booked new awards of $25.1 billion, and our ending backlog stood at $34.9 billion. Fluor's revenue remained strong at $27.4 billion, and net earnings attributable to Fluor rose to $668 million, or $4.06 per diluted share. Fluor's balance sheet remains strong, with year-end cash and marketable securities of $2.7 billion. During the year, we repurchased $200 million in shares and paid $79 million in dividends, while still maintaining one of the healthiest cash positions in the industry. We fully understand that to be the first choice of our clients, we must earn and sustain a reputation as their best choice. And we have the same commitment to you, our shareholders. During the year, Fluor won significant new projects, expanding critical client and partner relationships, putting us into new markets, and confirming our reputation for delivering excellence and value on even the most complex assignments.

2013 ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Strong and longstanding client relationships led to strategically important project awards in the much-anticipated petrochemicals rebirth on the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Dow Chemical Company hired Fluor to execute a considerable portion of its investments in the region. A Fluor joint venture won a significant contract from Chevron Phillips Chemical Company for its U.S. Gulf Coast petrochemicals project, and Fluor secured a front-end engineering and design (FEED) contract for Sasol's world-scale ethane cracker and chemicals facility at its Lake Charles Chemical Complex in Louisiana. In other Oil and Gas accomplishments, our relationship as BASF's engineering partner of choice expanded with a contract to build its major chemicals complex at BASF's site in Germany. And, especially noteworthy, we moved into the sizable and growing liquefied natural gas market (LNG) in 2013. Through a strategic partnership with JGC, we were selected for Chevron Canada Limited's proposed Kitimat LNG project that was announced in early 2014. Our company was also selected for a FEED project for engineering and design of the Anadarko Mozambique facility in the Republic of Mozambique. During the year, we completed the new East Span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the largest and longest single-tower, self-anchored suspension bridge in the world. We're proud to have delivered not only an iconic bridge, but also a sound structure that will withstand major seismic events and serve as an emergency lifeline route for disaster responses. In addition to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, a Fluor-led venture was selected for the design-build of the new Tappan Zee Hudson River Crossing Project, a mega project to deliver the single largest bridge in New York's history. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold extended its relationship with Fluor, with an award for construction management services for expansion of its Cerro Verde mine in Peru. In addition, the company established a new strategic relationship with Procter & Gamble for facilities management. Our work with key U.S. government agencies remained strong during the year, with continued support to U.S. troops through our LOGCAP IV contract in Afghanistan. The company also won a U.S. Department of Energy contract for the management and operation of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the world's largest supply of emergency crude oil. During the year, Fluor received notice to begin construction on Dominion Virginia Power's 1,358 megawatt combined-cycle natural gas­fired power plant in Virginia. And Fluor's nuclear small modular reactor technology company, NuScale Power, received approval for U.S. Department of Energy funding that will support its development, licensing and commercialization.

2013 ANNUAL REPORT

THE BLUEPRINT FOR GROWTH
STRENGTHENING OUR COMPANY THROUGH CHANGE
Expanding our portfolio and profitability
In our hearts, we are engineers and constructors. We excel at managing complexity and take pride in the fact that the more complex the project, the higher the likelihood that we will be there to do the work. But we also know that while complexity can be a great differentiator, our clients are driven by and expect quality performance at competitive prices. During 2013, we began three initiatives to improve client service and profitable growth, while providing our clients with added assurance for schedule and cost certainty. The company is working to increase its capabilities in direct-hire construction; to expand assets and alliances for modular construction and fabrication; and to use our exceptional knowledge in supply chain to provide greater benefit to our clients and improve the profitability of our company. We are positioned to move forward in these strategic areas during 2014. Each of these strategic initiatives requires a level of change. While they may vary in degree and complexity, each requires changing business models, mindsets and behaviors from our more recent past. We are up to the challenges and opportunities they represent. We will continue to improve our competitiveness across our full range of markets and services. We are well positioned to compete for and win work as our clients increase their capital spends with the pace of economic improvement.

USING OUR TALENTS, ENGINEERING EXPERTISE, INNOVATION AND CREATIVITY TO CHANGE
Creating our blueprint for the future
Our greatest asset is our people. Fluor's ability to deliver profitable growth depends on the quality, capabilities and commitment of Fluor employees. I thank them for their dedication to our company and our clients. I also want to acknowledge Fluor's directors for their steadfast guidance, support and confidence in the company, the leadership team and the future of Fluor. We say good-bye to two long-serving members of Fluor's board, Sue Woolsey and Kent Kresa. Sue and Kent have been exceptional members of our Board, and I thank them for sharing their expertise and leadership with Fluor. We wish them both the very best in retirement. We also welcomed two new esteemed business leaders to the Board of Directors: Lynn Swann, president of the marketing and consulting firm Swann Inc., and Deborah Doyle McWhinney, former chief executive officer of global enterprise payments at Citi. Through the efforts of our employees, leaders and board members, Fluor was once again recognized by Fortune magazine in its 2013 "World's Most Admired Companies" list, earning the top ranking in the engineering and construction sector and placing it in the overall top 10 in the "Global Competitiveness" category. We were also named as one of Ethisphere Institute's "World's Most Ethical Companies" for the seventh consecutive year. We look forward to another highly successful year in 2014. We firmly believe that we have motivated leaders and capable employees who will meet our expectations and those of our clients and investors.
