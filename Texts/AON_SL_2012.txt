 To Our Shareholders:
I am pleased to report that our firm finished 2012 with another year of strong performance, reflecting continued progress and momentum in our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions businesses as we deliver value to clients around two of the most important issues facing the global economy today: risk and people.
We finished the year having made significant investments in data and analytics, particularly with the Aon Global Risk Insight Platform (GRIP), and in health care exchanges. We took substantial steps to increase our strategic position and financial flexibility with the relocation of our headquarters to London. We delivered record cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion, and we created significant value for our shareholders through the repurchase of more than $1.1 billion of ordinary shares.
The accomplishments that our firm made over the last year are a direct result of the commitment and dedication of our over 65,000 colleagues around the world. Their tireless efforts make it possible for Aon to empower results for clients in every corner of the globe.
Over the course of 2012, Aon experienced a number of events that significantly impacted the identity and future of our firm. From the headquarters move to the temporary immobilization of our New York office by Superstorm Sandy, 2012 was an eventful year for Aon.
Overall, we achieved several goals against our three strategic objectives: provide distinctive value to our clients, attract and retain unmatched talent, and deliver operational excellence.
Our most significant accomplishments for 2012 include the following:
• We strengthened our industry-leading position as the #1 intermediary of primary risk insurance, the #1 intermediary of reinsurance, and the #1 human resource consulting and outsourcing firm with unmatched talent and capabilities.
• We increased free cash flow 48 percent to $1.2 billion driven by record cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion in 2012, enabling the return of $1.3 billion of excess capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and payment of dividends on our ordinary shares.
• We delivered 4 percent growth in net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders.
• Our performance reflects improved organic growth across our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions businesses in a year of continued macroeconomic pressures in many markets around the globe, as well as significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading platform, and effective capital management.
• The firm is solidly positioned for improved performance in 2013 as we scale the investments we made throughout 2012, continue to drive increased cash flow, and have significant leverage to an improving global economy
In Risk Solutions,
• We are investing in client capability and leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the continued roll-out of the Revenue Engine internationally, as well as with the Aon Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates.
• We continue to invest in innovative technology such as Aon GRIP, the world’s leading global data base of risk and insurance placement information. We now have over 1.5 million trades, more than $80 billion of bound premium and a growing client list of insurance carriers utilizing the platform for its industry-leading analytics and services capabilities.

• We are investing in our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, as highlighted by our ability to package similar risks and place substantial programs and facilities into the market on behalf of clients.
• In 2012, we aligned our global health and benefits platform to better capitalize on our global distribution channel and deep brokerage capabilities.
• We continue to expand our global footprint through tuck-in acquisitions that either increase scale in emerging markets or expand capability to better serve clients, such as Access Plans in our affinity business and the commercial unit of ABN Amro Bank NV. We also added key talent across Asia and Latin America in specialty sectors and in our GRIP services business.
Overall, we have ‘‘proved the concept’’ of these major investments in 2012, and as we move through 2013, we are on course to drive greater scale and increased operating leverage.
In HR Solutions,
• We are making significant investments to strengthen our industry-leading position in health care exchanges, both in the retiree and active employee markets.
• We are expanding our Outsourcing offerings in high-growth areas such as financial advisory services for retirement plan participants.
• We continue to expand our industry-leading benefits administration solutions and technology platform.
• We are developing new delegated solutions in investment consulting and pension risk management that leverage our total capabilities across advisory and delivery services.
• Finally, we are strengthening our international footprint to support a global workforce, with investments in key talent and capabilities across Asia and emerging markets.
In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that the magnitude, scope, and complexity of risk are growing at an alarming rate. Whether it was severe flooding in China, an earthquake in Italy, or Superstorm Sandy in the U.S., Aon’s colleagues acted in a rapid, responsive matter to help both clients and fellow colleagues deal with the business and personal implications of major catastrophes in 2012. Aon’s global network in over 120 countries makes it possible for our firm to promptly respond to any crisis regardless of size or geography.
In 2012, health care reform was the subject of much political and public debate throughout the United States. We anticipated this trend and we have made significant investments in our industry- leading position in health care exchanges. We launched the industry’s first multi-carrier corporate health exchange offering fully insured group plans in the fourth quarter of last year and we are focused on driving greater scale in 2013 and improved returns in 2014.
Our portfolio of Risk Solutions and HR Solutions gives us tremendous financial capacity to invest in our businesses, and equally important, in our clients and colleagues, specifically in critical areas including innovation, training, and technology. Whether creating modern and innovative solutions to today’s most pressing issues through ideas like health care exchanges or investing in leading technological tools such as GRIP, we are firmly committed to making strategic investments to better empower results for clients and increase value for shareholders.
Complacency is the strongest deterrent to progress and it is with this in mind that we continue to place an emphasis on our strategic investments as we strive to maintain our position as the world leader on the topics of risk and people while also delivering consistent margin improvement.
In 2012, we experienced a number of events that significantly impacted our firm. In October, Aon’s New York office was temporarily immobilized due to Superstorm Sandy. Our colleagues in the region responded to this business interruption with the utmost professionalism as they served clients who were

also affected by the storm. They also helped their fellow colleagues, many of whom found themselves without safe shelter for a period of time.
The year also saw the completion of our redomestication to the United Kingdom. The redomicile is creating increased shareholder value:
• It reinforces our market strategy in the U.K. with Lloyd’s and around the world;
• It is providing greater global access to expected increases in free cash flow;
• It enabled Aon to access approximately $300 million in excess capital help internationally on our balance sheet in 2012;
• It is increasing future cash flows through a significant reduction in our global tax rate over the long term due to changes in the geographic distribution of income, allowing Aon to remain competitive in the global marketplace; and,
• It is allowing us to more effectively allocate capital through share repurchases and dividends.
As a U.K.-headquartered multinational group, we are seeing increased interaction with international and emerging market clients reinforcing our relationships with London markets, increasing our international brand awareness, driving financial benefits related to the transaction and appreciating the opportunity to strengthen our relationship with the U.K. government as well as with the business and charitable community.
This is a great time to be a part of Aon. As we look ahead, we have positioned our industry- leading global platform for continued long-term value creation.
We are uniquely situated for increased long-term growth with significant leverage to an improving global economy and insurance pricing. We are investing in colleagues and capabilities around the globe to better serve clients.
We have before us the opportunity for long-term operating margin improvement, supported by a strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation with declining uses of required cash outlays.
We believe our increased financial flexibility and effective capital allocation will drive shareholder value in 2013.
Thank you for the continued faith and trust you have placed in our Board of Directors and management team. Your support is crucial to our efforts, and we will continue to work hard to not just meet but exceed your expectations. I hope you share my confidence in the view that continued success lies ahead for Aon in 2013 and beyond.
