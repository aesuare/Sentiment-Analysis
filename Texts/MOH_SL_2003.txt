Wyou visit the Molina Medical Center on Fruitridge Road in south Sacramento, or our clinicon No rwood Bouleva rd in Del Paso Heights, you will see one of the most important frontiers inAmerican healthcare. On any given day, yo u’ll find a wonderful mixture of geographic origins re p resented by ourpatients: Latino, Middle Eastern, Pakistani, Ukrainian, Filipino, East Indian, African American, Vietnamese andHmong, Samoan and Eu ropean. Yo u’ll find a diversity of traditions and approaches to healthcare as well. So m eHmong and Vietnamese parents, for example, tie strings around the necks and wrists of their babies – a traditionalpractice that “t i e s” the child’s soul to the earth. Many female patients from Muslim countries will see only a femalephysician, or speak to male doctors only through their husbands. Many patients from Mexico are accustomed to goingto pharmacists for treatment and turning to physicians only if an illness has become seve re .
Linking all of these culturally and linguistically diverse people together is their common need for healthcareservices. And making it all work, under the common umbrella of Medicaid, is Molina He a l t h c a re.In a sense, we have always been here. Since 1980, when my late father founded this company, we have focusedon serving Medicaid beneficiaries – first as providers through our clinics and, later, as a health plan as well. Over theyears, we have developed significant experience in bridging the divides of language and culture, meeting the healthneeds of our patients, and surpassing the expectations of payors to deliver cost-effective, quality care. We not onlyh a ve forged strong relationships with providers and government agencies, we have become integral members of thecommunities we serve. Our track re c o rd time and again has affirmed one of our founding principles: that pro f i t a b i l i t yand public service, far from being mutually exc l u s i ve goals, can be mutually re i n f o rc i n g .Last year witnessed the initial public offering of stock for Molina He a l t h c a re. In many ways, that event was thefulfillment of a dream that began 24 years ago – a dream that was nurt u red by our deep roots as a provider organizations e rving Medicaid patients. Yet in other important ways our IPO was only a beginning. To d a y, we arrange care for ove rhalf a million Medicaid beneficiaries in four states. Building on our experience and upon our leadership in serv i n gd i verse populations, we believe that the coming years will take us much, much furt h e r. California) to deliver healthcare services to our members, and we carefully select physicians and hospitals based on theirability to serve the particular needs of low-income persons.Not eve ry provider – nor eve ry health plan – possesses the experience or the willingness to meet those needs.That re a l i t y, in turn, presents a powe rful barrier to entry into our business. But for Molina He a l t h c a re, whichhas served this population for more than 20 years and has the special expertise re q u i red to deliver care in a waythat synergistically improves both health and cost outcomes, the field of Medicaid HMOs offers a pro m i s i n g ,widening opport u n i t y.Our effectiveness in capitalizing on this opportunity was reflected last year in Molina He a l t h c a re’s inclusion on In c .m a g a z i n e’s list of “A m e r i c a’s Urban Su p e r s t a r s” – the 100 fastest-growing private companies in the inner city. T h emagazine highlighted how many of the winning companies, which share our founding philosophy, “have mades u pp o rting and bettering their communities a central part of how they do business.”

Since it was enacted in 1965, Medicaid has provided healthcare benefits for tens of millions of low-income Americanst h rough matching funds to states. It also has significantly expanded its outreach through several Federal assistancep rograms: Te m p o r a ry Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), which succeeded the Aid to Families with De p e n d e n tC h i l d ren program; Su p p l e m e n t a ry Security Income (SSI); and the State Childre n’s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).While these programs grew, howe ve r, so did their costs – and, even more, the need for compre h e n s i ve managementof care. Tr a d i t i o n a l l y, Medicaid programs directly reimbursed providers after the delive ry of services. As a result, theretraditionally was no incentive for either patients or providers to pursue a systematic approach to care, and services we red e l i ve red in an uncoordinated, costly manner. With limited or minimal access to primary care physicians and pre ve n t i vec a re, such as immunizations or prenatal care, poor (and poorly informed) Medicaid patients more often than notsought care episodically, often waiting until a problem was acute (and more expensive to treat) before seeing a doctor.When they did seek treatment, even for routine needs, it often was through the costliest and least efficient setting:a hospital emergency ro o m .Responding to costs that we re rising by almost 20% each ye a r, the Federal government greatly broadened the abilityof states to direct Medicaid patients into managed care programs. In the process, they also created an exciting opport u n i t yfor our company – one that makes it possible simultaneously to control costs, improve the quality of care and operatea profitable business. Pursuing that opport u n i t y, Molina has established both a strong track re c o rd and a distinctiveposition within the healthcare field.Only a few years ago, managing care for state Medicaid programs re p resented a new frontier in the healthcare field.Now, the promise of this new territory that we re c o g n i zed eight years ago is becoming abundantly evident. For Mo l i n aHe a l t h c a re, which can deliver we l l - c o o rdinated care, focus on pre ve n t i ve medicine and improve outcomes, Me d i c a i dmanaged care presents a fertile field for grow t h .Because the program serves those without an ability to pay and relies on government funding (and because it isoften confused with Me d i c a re), a frequent misperception is that managed care for Medicaid patients offers limitedpotential. The reality is far different.By comparison with the Me d i c a re population, Medicaid recipients are typically young and healthy. The ave r a g eage of persons cove red by Medicaid is 14, and most patients are young women and children; the average Me d i c a re patient is over 70. As a result of this age discre p a n c y, Medicaid must cover far fewer chronic conditions associated withaging – and has witnessed cost trends well below those for the overall population. Mo re ove r, the challenge of m a n a g i n gMedicaid costs lies more in improving access to routine and pre ve n t i ve care, a strategy that is far less available witholder adults under Me d i c a re .Medicaid also presents a large, growing market. In 2003, more than 49 million Americans we re cove red under thep rogram – a 15% increase from just three years earlier. Medicaid pays for nearly 40% of all births in this country andp rotects 1 in 3 of our children. And with eve ry increase of 1% in the national unemployment rate, Medicaid enro l l m e n tg rows by 400,000 able-bodied adults and 1 million children.Meanwhile, Medicaid is also expanding through SCHIP to provide coverage for previously uninsured familieswho do not otherwise qualify for assistance but who cannot afford private insurance. SCHIP’s stru c t u re, whichrequires states to absorb barely one-fourth of the total expense, has encouraged growth in enrollment of nearly 40%nationally since 2001.As a result of all these contributing factors, the CMS/Office of the Actuary projects that combined state andfederal expenditures on Medicaid and SCHIP will rise from $180 billion in 1999 to $588 billion by 2012.While the Medicaid managed care population affords a vast potential market, the pro g r a m’s stru c t u re permits usto pursue it selective l y. Unlike Me d i c a re, Medicaid is administered by the individual states, which determine eligibility,establish benefits packages and set payment rates. Thus, we can concentrate on states with the strongest, best managedp rograms, while enjoying the flexibility not to participate in certain other states if we choose.The fastest growing segment within Medicaid is managed care. Mo re than half of the states (including all fourin which we operate) now mandate managed care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Consequently, Medicaid managed caree n rollment grew by nearly 50% between 1996 and 2001, while state and federal payments to Medicaid managed careorganizations are projected to continue to enjoy healthy 10-13% annual increases through 2010.

While our chosen field provides fertile ground for growth, it takes more than a Medicaid contract to guarantee s u c c e s s .Molina He a l t h c a re has grown because of its experience-based approach to serving diverse Medicaid populat i o n s .First and foremost, beginning with our primary care clinics in California, our company grew up in theneighborhoods where our members live and work. That experience still proves invaluable even as our business hasexpanded. The 21 clinics that we currently operate, besides remaining consistently profitable, equip us with first-handk n owledge of our members’ unique needs, insights into the practice patterns of physicians, and furnish a platform forp i l o t i n g n ew pro g r a m s .Our early experience impressed upon our management the critical importance of community-based patienteducation to the goal of cost-effective healthcare management. Through these efforts – which emphasize routinep re ve n t i ve care, prenatal care and disease management – we help avoid the much higher costs of episodic care in theemergency room setting – and promote better health outcomes by addressing problems before they become acute.This a p p roach runs counter to the popular perception of HMOs; far from limiting access, we promote greater accessto the entire continuum of care, particularly at the times when it can do the greatest good. And by providing them o re coordinated, holistic approach that managed care was originally envisioned to offer, we help avoid the episodic,s h o rt-sighted and highly expensive delive ry of services that for so long plagued the Medicaid program and the people it was designed to benefit. In the process, we not only help to enhance patients’ overall health but savemoney in the long-run for Medicaid and for taxpaye r s .

In addition, our unique cultural and linguistic expertise removes other traditional barriers that have hinderedp roviders from effectively serving many Medicaid beneficiaries. In California, for example, we have establishedcultural advisory committees served by a full-time cultural anthropologist. We carefully educate providers in ourn e t w o rks about these distinct needs. We develop member education materials in a variety of languages withaudience-appropriate literacy levels. Visit our website, www.molinahealthcare.com, and you can access the contentin six different languages.Culturally sensitive member education plays a key role in our ability to control costs and improve outcomes. But it iso n l y one prong of our efforts. Equally important are our efforts at optimizing management and administrative efficiency.

Nationwide, claims processing consumes a significant portion of the total dollars spent on healthcare. To minimizethose costs, we implemented centralized claims processing and information services that operate from a single IT platform.We have standard i zed our medical management programs, pharmacy benefits management contracts and health education.As a result of all these efforts, we believe that Molina He a l t h c a re’s administrative efficiency is among the best in our field.We bring the same approach to medical management. For example, we carefully monitor day-to-day delive ry of medicalc a re to ensure both its appropriateness and efficiency. T h rough our pharmacy management programs, we educatep roviders on the use of generic drugs – and have achieved one of the highest rates of generic utilization in our industry.Although we derive efficiency from standardization, we also maintain an exceptional degree of flexibility. Ou rsystems support a variety of provider contracting models – fee-for-service, capitation, per diem, case rates andD RGs ( d i a g n o s t i c - related groups) – that are easily adaptable to different markets and conditions. Ac c o rd i n g l y, we arein excellent position to contract with the providers – including independent physicians and medical groups, hospitalsand ancillary service providers – who are best able to serve our members based on prox i m i t y, experience, culture andre c o rd of quality outcomes.Mo re import a n t l y, as we strive for greater efficiency, we do not compromise the quality of medical care delive re dto our members. Our company is committed to quality and has made accreditation a strategic goal for each ofMolina's health plans. Cu r re n t l y, our California and Michigan health plans are accredited by the Na t i o n a lCommittee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), and our other health plans are expected to undergo accreditation in thecoming ye a r. This commitment to quality provides additional comfort to the state agencies with which we contract,assuring that tax dollars are being spent on quality health care .

Scalability is not merely an article of faith for our company. It is our history. We have consistently replicated ourmodel in different markets and under differing circumstances. In Utah, for instance, we successfully transplanted our model from California into a new market. In Michigan and Washington, meanwhile, we acquired existing health planoperations and integrated them into our model. Much of this success, we believe, flows from our administrative andoperational infrastru c t u re, which facilitates rapid, cost-effective expansion. In this way and others, we believe that ourpast experience is the most reliable predictor of our company’s future .O ver the past two decades, we have demonstrated our ability to establish strong relationships with providers andg overnment agencies, to deliver quality care to low-income persons, to grow our business and to make a real differe n c ein the health of the communities we serve – and to do it all efficiently and pro f i t a b l y. By bringing true managementto managed care and genuine caring to healthcare, we have created win/win/win situations for patients, for stateg overnments and, not least, for our company and share h o l d e r s .

Now, building on this strong foundation, we look forw a rd to forging an even stronger future along the lines ofg rowth we have already laid out. Just as we have done pre v i o u s l y, we plan to expand within our current markets byi n c reasing the size of our service area, our provider network and our membership. Just as before, we intend to continueto enter promising new markets. And, just as always, we will continue to leverage our long experience to optimizeoperating efficiencies and to manage medical costs effective l y.This is an exciting time in our field. For us, there has always been a special satisfaction that comes from invo l ve m e n tin a business that allows us to witness real improvements in the lives of those we serve – improvements they might noto t h e rwise enjoy. Now, we are more excited than eve r, as we fulfill, for an ever growing number of people, the healthcaremission that began with the Molina name 24 years ago.We are grateful for your support and your investment that allows us to continue doing what we do best – prov i d equality healthcare to people who need us the most.Si n c e re l y,
