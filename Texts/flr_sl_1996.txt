selacklog does not reflect A.P. Massey Coal operations or certain Diversified Services activities.

In reflecting on the past year, I'm struck by a number of strong ballets. First, there is a feeling of just how fortunate I am to Separo of the Fluor Daniel and Massey teams, both olear leaders in their respective industries. Second, there is the constant reinforcement that those teams are made up of such outstanding and dedicated members who are constantly challenging the status 900 00 they seek ta improve in all aspects. Third, there is the realization that we are exceptionally well positioned to benefit from explosivo global expansion of so many industries. Each day we see the importance and power of liberalized trade and investment policies. Your company just completed the best year in its history. Records were set in tour key areas: earnings up 16 percent; revenues up 18 percent; new amar do up a strong 22 percent; and a safety performance which surpassed last year's impressive recules and reconfirms that Fluor Daniel is indeed the safest contractor worldwide. Most of our markets were highly active. In our Fluor Daniel operations, demand for petroleum/petrochemical and chemical facilities; a number of mining, electronics, telecommunication, consumer product pro/erro and power opportunities; along with important new projects from the U.S. Department of Energy, all helped to improve performance. Our Diversified Services Group recorded a particularly strong year, including positive results from recent acquisitions. As raposead

to you in previous annual reports, we are providing certain of our core competencias so clients outside the typical project cycle, thereby increasing our growth and profit potential. In A.T. Massey's operations, demand for low-sulfur steam and metallurgical coal also remained strong. This, together with our new longwall mining installation, which dramatically reduces coso and increases output, and our unique ability to rapidly shift production ta meet customer needs, combined tu help give Massey its best year eve!. Results from continuing operations hace now grown on average 15 percent for the past nine years, ranking us among the best performing of all U.S. industry. Yet we believe matando better in both growth rate and return on shareholders' equity. As we continually remind employees worldwide, this company has only scratched the surface of its potential. Asma look ahead, we are very encouraged about our prospects. Global economic expansion and capital spending appear robe oca sustainable, upward trend, with Latir America, Asia Pacific, the Middle East, and Central and Eastern Europe heading the list. But justas signif icant, the strategy we have embracedro provide more services ro more clients in more locations than any global competitor and ro do so in a wat' which is BETTER, FASTER, CHEAPER and SAFERis facilitating accomplishment of the many stretch goals we hace set for ourselves. In building upon last year's success, you should know that we contemplate further actions designed to increase shareholder value. Por the past three years, we haca made a number of strategic investments, both in acquisitions and internal expansion with such moves as the opening of new offices, the relocation of key executives to be closer to markets and clients, and development of important new technologies and services. While many of these investments are beginning ta show results, meare mindful that initiatives of this kind tend so bring along corresponding increases in operating expenses, causing pressure on margins. Throughout 1997, we will take steps to strengthen our mar gins through achievement of greater cost efficiencies in our operations and projects, and continue to be highly selective in those projects we choose ta pursue. In the pages which follow, we discuss the vital importance that culture continuas to play in our ongoing success. We truly sacro borders nor limito to our market potential and what macan achieve when we fully focus our global resources. Our cara strengths are the envy of our industry, and the culture we are creating assures their long-term viability. In referencing our many successes, I would be remiss if I did not
acknowledge the contributions of our Board. You should know that your Board is actively involved in overseeing company initiatives and last fall spent several days with our Leadership Team reviewing overall company direction and strategy. Through their knowledge of our businesses and

perSpectives cor oui industry, many thoughtful observations were put forth which have been key to firming up our plans for cha futura. It was with a great deal of pleasure that we welcomed two new directors to our Board. Don L Blankenship, chairman and chief execu. rice officer of A.T. Massey, was elected In September. Thomas L. Gossage, retired chairman and former president and chief exec utive officer of Hercules, Inc., was elected in January. Both bring very valuable business perspectivas and will be a strength for us In the future. This is truly an exciting time for Fluor. On behalf of our employees worldwide, I want to thank our mane clients for their trust and confidence in our work, and youour ownersfor your support in the past, and confidence in our futura.
