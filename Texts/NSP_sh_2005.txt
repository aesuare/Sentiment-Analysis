  Forging ahead...
Letter to Shareholders
 Paul J. Sarvadi
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Administaff ’s record results in 2005 represent the most successful year in our history and provide a strong foundation for the Company’s future. During our 20th year in business, we accelerated our unit growth into the double digits, maintained effective pricing and direct cost management, and achieved significant operating leverage.
Revenues for 2005 increased 20.6 percent to $1.2 billion, due to a 13.9 percent increase in the average number of worksite employees paid and a 5.9 percent increase in revenues per worksite employee per month. Gross profit increased 19.3 percent to $235.8 million, with average gross profit per worksite employee per month at $221 versus $211 in 2004 due to an increased service fee markup and a higher surplus from direct cost programs. Net income and diluted net earnings per share climbed to $30.0 million and $1.12, versus $19.2 million and $0.72 for 2004. The Company also increased operating income by
98 percent and generated more than $65.3 million in EBITDA, which contributed to an increase of $45.7 million in working capital.
These financial results demonstrate the ongoing strength of our proven business model. In addition, several of our 2005 achievements support our goal of forging ahead toward even greater success in 2006 and beyond. These accomplishments included:
A record fall selling season. In 2005, our fall sales exceeded 20,500 worksite employees, 14 percent ahead of internal targets and 27 percent ahead of the 2004 season. Building on the momentum gained during this record campaign, we are positioned for another strong sales year in 2006, during which we plan to open as many as six new sales offices and increase our number of trained sales consultants from 225 to an average of 250.

   “It is through the passion and forward vision we all share that we are able to put Administaff ’s services to work for the good of America’s best small and medium-sized businesses.”
Continuously improving client satisfaction levels. Our 2005 satisfaction survey results yielded our highest-ever rating – 91 percent, versus 88 percent in 2004 – and attrition levels were at their lowest point in five years. Enhancing the “high- touch” aspect of our service, we rolled out our contact center nationwide and launched new customer relationship management technology designed to improve the way we manage client information and interaction.
Major progress on our middle-market sales front. We increased sales to com- panies with 150 to 2,000 employees by 50 percent over 2004, with more than 4,800 of our worksite employee total for 2005 attributed to our middle-market effort. This increase resulted from the dedication of six sales consultants to this program, as well as the introduction of a new assessment tool that evaluates the overall HR condition at prospective client companies and provides a strategy for improvement. We also developed a new survey, to be administered beginning
in 2006, for identifying products and services that will help us to continue gaining momentum in the middle-market arena.
The addition of new initiatives to help generate leads and revenues. We continued tobuildoureBusinessportal,MarketPlace,SM withtheadditionof15newalliance relationships, including a home and auto insurance offering through Travelers Insurance. In December, we acquired certain assets of KnowledgePoint, including HRTools.com, a leading online portal for HR products and services. The acquisi- tion also included a wide range of business applications related to job descrip- tions, performance reviews, and personnel policies and procedures. In 2006,
we will launch a redesign of HRTools.com and begin using it to further extend our brand, offering it as a resource to small businesses that might not be a fit for Administaff’s comprehensive service model.
In closing, I would like to extend management’s sincere appreciation for the dedication of our corporate staff and valuable guidance from our Board of Directors, both of which helped us to achieve superior results in 2005. It is through the passion and forward vision we all share that we are able to put Administaff’s services to work for the good of America’s best small and medium-sized businesses.
Sincerely,
