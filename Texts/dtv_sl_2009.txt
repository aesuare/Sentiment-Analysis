A Message to Shareholders

Michael D. White President and Chief Executive Officer

Our 2009 Report comes at a time of significant momentum in terms of our operating performance and free cash flow growth, strengthening our position at the leading edge of the television experience. It's also a time of transition, as this marks my first letter to DIRECTV shareholders. As someone who's been looking into every corner of this company since coming onboard as CEO in January, I'm convinced that DIRECTV brings the total package: a video symphony highlighted by an advantaged technology platform delivering distinctive content done with a twist, and industry-leading customer service backed up by the best brand in the business. It also doesn't hurt to bring a strong balance sheet to today's competitive market with the power to generate significant amounts of free cash flow. In some ways, DIRECTV's strengths come as no surprise. The fact is, long before I ever imagined becoming CEO at DIRECTV, I was a DIRECTV customer. What I wanted was a service that used the latest technology to bring me and my family the hot new shows, hit movies and big games ­ with superior sound and picture, and outstanding customer service at a competitive price. As I soon found out, DIRECTV delivered. But I also knew that as a consumer, I had choices when it came to home entertainment. That customer perspective is one I'm going to work hard to keep as a means of testing how well we're delivering the DIRECTV experience in the future. The reasons for DIRECTV's success are hardly a secret: It's a terrific product delivered by a talented team of people. No new CEO taking the helm could ask for a stronger foundation. In the 5 ½ years that Chase Carey led DIRECTV, the company added over 11 million subscribers in the U.S. and Latin America, more than doubling revenues while generating over $5 billion of free cash flow. Since leaving, Chase has been very generous with his time, sharing advice and perspectives. I'm also grateful to Larry Hunter for his steady leadership during the transition period before my arrival earlier this year. 

DRIVING RETURNS FROM A STRONG BASE Our full-year results confirm that 2009 was an extremely strong year for both our U.S. and Latin American businesses giving us a great base to build on in 2010 and beyond.

n the U.S., despite an increasingly competitive industry and the I continued impact of the economic downturn, DIRECTV added the most net subscribers in four years.  e grew our Pre-SAC margin by more than a point and drove W capital expenditures down about 15% ­ and we did both while significantly improving our call center and installer network's performance. n 2009, DIRECTV once again posted the highest customer service I rating in the ASCI ­ the American Customer Satisfaction Index ­ beating all major cable companies for the 9th consecutive year. n Latin America, our performance was even more impressive, I as we established new records for most key metrics including net additions, revenues and operating profit before depreciation and amortization.  ll told, these achievements drove industry-leading results at A the consolidated DIRECTV level, including nearly 10% revenue growth and 40% free cash flow growth.  n top of all of that, we completed the merger with Liberty O Entertainment and repurchased another $1.7 billion of stock, bringing the total buyback to nearly $10 billion in the past four years, reducing our shares outstanding by a third.

The strengths we've shown will prove critical, especially now. Today is a time of several simultaneous transitions: In the macroeconomic environment, consumers are decidedly more cautious and focused on getting good value for every dollar they spend. In the world of technology, the pace of change provides consumers

with more choices and options while raising their expectations. And in the pay TV marketplace, competition has intensified while our programming partners continue to seek higher rates for the content we show. But the challenges we face can't obscure the opportunities we see. Everything in our research tells us that consumers remain passionate about watching video ­ both inside and outside of their homes. We know that video is the fastest growing service on the Internet, as well as on phones and other portable devices. Furthermore, the strong demographics of our higher quality subscribers have provided a degree of insulation against the economic downturn compared to most of our competitors. And in Latin America, we continue to see tremendous growth opportunities for years to come. With that in mind, my goal is to build on DIRECTV's successful track record and take us to even higher levels of market share, revenue, profits, and cash flow. To do that, we have to maintain the many things we're doing well ­ things that define the DIRECTV experience ­ but also accelerate our innovative creativity to make sure we attain our goal of delivering the best video experience anytime and anywhere. STRENTHENING OUR CORE In the U.S., we must continue to lead the industry by introducing compelling new products and services that differentiate us from our competitors. For example, with the successful launch of our new D-12 satellite, we now have the capacity to increase

our national HD channels by 50% furthering our leadership position in the industry. Last year we greatly enhanced our user interface and programming guide with the launch of SmartSearchTM, a ground-breaking search engine that makes it so much easier for our customers to find their favorite shows faster than ever before. In addition to offering great services, we must also continue to build the strength of our brand through innovative advertising and marketing campaigns designed to attract high-quality subscribers. And of course, we have to continue managing our costs with discipline to support margin expansion. PUSHING THE INNOVATION ENVELOPE This much is clear: given the continued advancements in technology coupled with an evolving economic and consumer environment, we must continue to refine DIRECTV's strategic and operational priorities. As solid as our approach is today, we recognize that we can't be locked in to what's worked in the past or closed off to new approaches that open more opportunities for us to connect with our customers. In first half 2010, we are conducting a comprehensive review of our strategies ­ and the assumptions that underlie them. Even now, based on my initial observations, I know we will be making a few shifts in emphasis going forward. The key factor driving our growth has been our vision to provide the best television experience to our customers. While that television experience remains critical, consumers also expect

us to evolve into more of a full video provider ­ delivering access to their favorite programming whenever and wherever they want it. Our subscribers want to be able to watch the big game or catch their favorite hit series on their laptop or their mobile phone. As a result, in 2010, we'll continue to push the innovation envelope. DIRECTV will make it even easier for our customers to not only record their favorite shows, but to access that programming from any television in their home - with a single, whole-home solution that will also "play cooperatively" with other media devices in the home. That will put DIRECTV at the heart of the entertainment experience whether our subscribers are at home or on-the-go. In addition to expanding access to the DIRECTV experience, we will launch the industry's first 3D channel lineup, offering the latest 3D movie releases and sporting events like the Major League Baseball All-Star game to help drive the development of future 3D content. We will also introduce a greatly enhanced DIRECTV CinemaTM: an exciting new movie service allowing our customers to watch the latest box office hits with a simple click of their remote, rather than waiting days or even weeks for those same movies to arrive by mail. At long last, "The Postman Always Rings Twice" will revert to its status as a classic film ­ and not the signal that the DVD you've been waiting for has finally arrived. All of these innovations are underway right now. Even as this letter is going to press, we are expanding our pay-per-view offerings from 15 to nearly 400 titles ­ and about half of these will be ready to watch at the same time they become available on DVD.

We're also pushing the marketing envelope to increase market share through a strategy that capitalizes on our strengths while exploiting competitors' weaknesses. We've put a 2010 priority on targeting under-penetrated segments such as the Hispanic, multiple dwelling unit and commercial markets, as well as working more creatively with our Telco partners to accelerate growth in their territories. CONNECTING FOR LIFE Developing the most advanced technology and providing the best programming packages underscore what really drives DIRECTV's success: Our connection to our customers. Nothing is more important than our 18.5 million subscribers. We know we have to continue to invest and work even harder to earn their loyalty on a daily basis. Although DIRECTV generally ranks at the top of our industry in customer satisfaction and has made excellent progress over the last year, we need to do even better. We have to take the view that when people subscribe to DIRECTV, our commitment to service is a contract for life: Once we make that connection with a customer, we've got to do all we can to keep it vibrant and strong. Reaching higher service levels means being open to a wideranging re-think: It may mean policy changes, or new sales and marketing tactics ­ perhaps even further investments in the homes of our customers. In that way, we'll turn churn from being a challenge into our greatest value-driver ­ a means, as our industry matures, to keep connected to our customers so that they stay connected to DIRECTV.

GROWING RAPIDLY IN LATIN AMERICA Our strength in the U.S. market is only one part of the DIRECTV picture. We have a tremendous business in Latin America, with incredible upside. To put the opportunity in perspective consider this: Right now, in Brazil ­ Latin America's fastest growing economy ­ pay TV penetration is 12%. Across all of Latin America it's only about 25%. Compare that to the U.S. which is 90%. With the relative strength of Latin America's economies and the mass migration of so many Latin American families into the middle class, it's entirely reasonable to think that pay TV penetration could double in this decade. It's a great situation when both the pie itself is getting bigger ­ and so is our slice. 2009 showed the velocity with which we're penetrating this promising market:
n

We're also offering Latin American consumers the mix of local and international content we know they're looking ~ for ­ exclusive sports programming like La Liga Espanola (the Spanish soccer league) and the English Premiere League, which we carry live and in HD. Finally, we have the best coverage of FIFA's 2010 World Cup: Not only will DTVLA be the only provider to broadcast every game in HD, we're also producing six hours a day of original content that will greatly enhance the viewing experience. As part of our corporate strategic review, we'll look for ways to leverage our core competencies in Latin America to continue driving strong growth across the region, while selectively assessing the opportunities we have outside of Latin America. WILL TO WIN With our strong base in the U.S. market and ground-floor growth in Latin America, it's not surprising that in 2009 DIRECTV became the world's largest pay TV provider. But it's what we're doing to retain our #1 status ­ and build on it ­ that demonstrates DIRECTV's will to win. The foundation for our success starts with our people who thrive in a performance culture that is punctuated by a passion for leadership, innovation and executional excellence. Looking ahead, we see several key catalysts for the kind of continued growth that will create sustained shareholder value. We're going to keep growing our core businesses in the U.S. and Latin America by continuing to deliver compelling and distinctive content, technological innovation, and an ironclad bond with our customers. We will also keep our heads up, alert to opportunities where we can bring DIRECTV to new audiences and new markets. In addition to the recently announced $3.5 billion share repurchase program, we're planning to communicate a more comprehensive "return of capital" strategy later this year that keeps our shareholders invested in our success for years to come. From everything I've seen since I've come onboard, we have the assets, talent and balance sheet to continue delivering outstanding growth in our revenues, profits and cash flow. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our Chairman John Malone for his tremendous support and strategic insights, while also acknowledging that our future success is greatly bolstered by the guidance and leadership of our entire Board of Directors. I look forward to working with our Board and every member of the DIRECTV team to ensure that we continue to make DIRECTV the world's best video experience.

 IRECTV Latin America (DTVLA) posted full year gross additions D of 1.58 million ­ that's a record, up 13% over 2008.  he combination of higher gross additions and lower churn drove T an 11% increase in net additions ­ bringing our total DTVLA subscriber base at year's end to 4.6 million. Add in Sky Mexico, and DTVLA has over 6.5 million subscribers throughout the region.  nd with this strong subscriber growth, revenues grew 21% to A $2.9 billion.

What's behind the success of our Latin America strategy? To a large degree, it's the same formula that we have in the U.S: Deliver absolutely the best television experience through leadership in content, technology and service. Because our businesses work so closely together, we are able to seamlessly transition our U.S. technology and expertise to Latin America. Case in point: DTVLA was able to take advantage of our early HD and DVR leadership in the U.S. to launch those services ahead of the competition in Latin America with superior set-top boxes offering more features at a lower cost. In Brazil, we're offering nearly 30 channels in HD, three times more than the competition. We launched our HD offering in mid2009, and we're already reaching double-digit penetration levels. In the rest of the region, we've built a substantial leadership position in DVRs, and we're now seeing over 30% of new subscribers sign up for these services. In addition to superior technology, we invested in understanding the unique needs of the Latin American consumer. We didn't assume that the preferences driving consumer behavior in the U.S. work the same way everywhere else. The middle market in Latin America remains disproportionately a cash economy. We've adjusted to that, developing a portfolio of pre-paid service packages as well as lower-priced post-paid plans to allow DTVLA to provide pay TV in ways that work for Latin America's emerging markets.
