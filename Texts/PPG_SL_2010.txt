      Letter from the Chairman
In the last two quarters of 2010, PPG posted record earnings, and for the full year the company posted very strong earnings, despite sales volume levels that were still $1.2 billion below pre-recession levels. Our performance benefited from the strategic actions we successfully implemented over the past decade and was supplemented by the decisive steps we took during the recession.
We have transformed PPG from a diversified, North American-centric manufacturer to a global coatings, optical products and specialty materials company. As a result, these combined businesses are now twice the size they were 10 years ago, and they comprised 83 percent of PPG’s total sales in 2010. In addition, our businesses in emerging regions grew 20 percent in 2010. With sales of nearly $3.6 billion, these regions now account for about 27 percent of the company. The United States and Canada now represent less than 50 percent of our sales, versus 75 percent 10 years ago. This portfolio shift and geographic expansion helped to buoy our company during the recession and has positioned PPG to leverage the current economic recovery.
At PPG, we have emphasized the importance of operational excellence as a key component of delivering strong financial results throughout the business cycle. In 2010, we continued that tradition and embarked upon four key initiatives to bolster our operations.
First, we continued to reduce our cost structure. We completed two previously announced restructuring programs. We also implemented more than $50 million in additional cost savings initiatives, so that to date, we’ve reduced our annual costs by more than $500 million versus 2008.
Second, we keyed in on restoring our margins, especially in coatings. We were successful in this effort. And, in fact, we boosted margins to above pre-recession levels in nearly all of our business segments.
Third, we focused on improving our supply chains, increasing efficiency, reducing working capital and enhancing cash flow. As a result, PPG’s operating working capital as a percent of sales dropped to 19 percent in 2010, versus 21
Lastly, we continued to invest for profitable growth, with organic capital spending up nearly 30 percent in 2010. During the year, we began construction of a new coatings resin facility in China and expanded the manufacturing capacity of two coatings plants, also in China.
Our financial performance in 2010 is clear evidence that these efforts are bearing fruit. Our earnings per share for 2010 were $4.63, more than double last year and up 42 percent versus 2008. This, combined with our record second half earnings, demonstrates how strongly we are emerging from the recession.
As a result, we continued our strong track record of cash generation. In 2010, PPG returned nearly 75 percent of cash from operations, or nearly $1 billion, to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Even during the depth of the recession, PPG did not waiver in its commitment to increase its annual dividend payment. PPG has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1899 and has increased its annual dividend payout for the past 39 years.
As we begin 2011, we expect the economic recovery to strengthen and broaden in most end-use markets and regions. However, construction in the developed regions and in Eastern Europe was depressed throughout 2010 and remains challenging. We also experienced higher coatings raw material costs in 2010, particularly in the second half of the year. As a result, we raised our selling prices over the course of 2010 in all of our businesses, and we are in the process of implementing further pricing initiatives to offset this persistent inflation. If necessary, we intend to take further actions to offset this inflation in 2011. So, our challenges are not behind us. Yet, based on the way we’ve managed through adversity in the recent past, I believe we’ll be able to overcome these obstacles.
What’s more, I believe we are only now beginning to see the full earnings power of the company. Today, with a focus on coatings and specialty products, a broader geographic footprint, a leaner organization with a lower cost structure, and an increasingly efficient set of businesses, we are going into 2011 poised to take advantage of the global economic recovery.
Fueling our momentum in 2011, we have the benefit of a strong position of nearly $2 billion in cash and short-term investments. We intend to take a balanced approach to uses for this cash, in addition to the cash we expect to generate in 2011. We expect to continue to return cash to shareholders but we also intend to invest for profitable growth, not only through organic efforts to strengthen our businesses but also through a disciplined process of identifying and pursuing small- to medium-sized acquisitions, primarily in coatings and in emerging regions.
By continuing to implement our strategy, and by maintaining a sharp focus on operational excellence, I’m confident that PPG’s performance will improve and accelerate even further, and that we will continue to provide strong value for our shareholders.
