To Our Shareholders:

Robert J. Hugin
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

2012 was an exceptional year for Celgene. Revenues were strong, earnings per share exceeded our initial expectations and operating margins improved significantly, highlighting the power and productivity of our business model. We actively managed our balance sheet and capital structure to enhance shareholder returns. As importantly, we achieved several transformational clinical milestones and advanced our key pipeline programs. We delivered substantial value for our stakeholders while fulfilling our promise to help the tens of thousands of patients globally who can benefit from our innovative therapies. These results reflect strong operating momentum and execution worldwide, positioning us extraordinarily well for our next phase of growth. From 2013 to 2017 we are committed to delivering annual growth of 19 percent and 25 percent in net product sales and adjusted earnings, respectively. To achieve these targets, we are focused on four strategic imperatives that guide and direct what we do every day. Specifically: ·  Operational Excellence ·  Capitalizing on Strengths in Hematology ·  Building New Businesses in Oncology and Inflammation and Immunology ·  Sustaining Innovation and Long-Term Growth to make substantial investments in Research and Development and advancing over 100 clinical trials evaluating our products in an expanding range of diseases. Our commercial teams were focused on delivering strong product volume growth globally that resulted in net sales of $5.4 billion, a 15 percent increase over the previous year. We gained market share for our core cancer therapeutics and launched ABRAXANE for a new indication in the U.S. Our top three therapies returned double-digit increases in sales from the previous year: ·  REVLIMID full year sales were $3,767 million, an increase of 17 percent. ·  VIDAZA full year sales were $823 million, an increase of 17 percent. ·  ABRAXANE full year sales were $427 million, an increase of 11 percent. We continued to optimize our capital structure by taking advantage of the favorable interest rate environment and issuing $1.5 billion in senior unsecured notes. In addition, we returned $2.1 billion in capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Since implementing the program four years ago, we have repurchased over $5 billion of our common stock.

Operational Excellence
In 2012, our performance was driven by strength across key operational and financial metrics. Total revenue grew by 14 percent to $5.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share increased 30 percent to $4.91. We achieved a higher rate of growth in earnings by leveraging our global infrastructure and improving operating efficiency. Our adjusted operating margin increased to 48.1 percent, a 300 basis point improvement over 2011. We captured these efficiency gains while continuing

Our company is stronger today than it has ever been. We are extremely well positioned to build on the important progress we achieved in 2012 and to seize the opportunities in 2013 and beyond.

Capitalizing on Strengths in Hematology
We are expanding our global leadership position in hematology as we continue to bring new therapies to treat patients with devastating diseases. Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved POMALYST, our newest immunomodulatory agent, for patients with multiple myeloma who have progressed in their disease after receiving at least two prior therapies including REVLIMID and bortezomib. Our POMALYST regulatory submission to the Euro pean Medicines Agency (EMA) is under review with a decision expected later this year. Importantly, this submission is supported by a randomized Phase III study in which POMALYST demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival.

The addition of POMALYST represents an important new therapy for patients with heavily pre-treated disease and few remaining treatment options--complementing our existing portfolio of multiple myeloma treatments. Our flagship product, REVLIMID, is well established as a backbone of multiple myeloma therapy in our core markets. We continue to expand our geographic reach into emerging markets with the approval earlier this year in China. Gaining access in other markets, such as Brazil, Korea, Mexico and Russia, is a key focus. We expect these markets to make meaningful contributions to REVLIMID's longterm growth. A top near-term priority is to advance REVLIMID in multiple myeloma to patients with previously untreated disease. Last year we experienced a delay in achieving this goal, as we withdrew our European marketing application for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and maintenance therapy (NDMM). We made this decision to allow time for the datasets from MM-015, CALGB 104 and IMF 0502, the trials supporting the application, to

Our focus on operating excellence has produced a track record of outstanding financial results over the last five years. Total revenue has increased 31% annually with a corresponding 47% annual increase in adjusted earnings.

further mature. Throughout 2013 we expect updates to these trials, in addition to new data from the largest Phase III trial conducted to date in this setting--MM-020. Collec tively, these data will shape our global NDMM regulatory strategy going forward. We are making good progress advancing programs that evaluate REVLIMID in new diseases. The FDA recently granted priority review to our supplemental New Drug Application (NDA) for relapsed or refractory mantle-cell lymphoma. A decision is expected in June. Additional Phase III trials are either underway or planned to evaluate a variety of clinical strategies with REVLIMID in more common forms of lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell and follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Finally, earlier this year we completed enrollment in a Phase III trial in elderly patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our Phase III trial testing REVLIMID as maintenance therapy in CLL continues to enroll patients. With each and every completed study, we expand our understanding of how and in which settings REVLIMID can benefit patients.

Building New Businesses in Oncology and Inflammation and Immunology
The last 12 months bear witness to an unprecedented number of successful outcomes validating the potential of our Oncology and Inflammation and Immunology businesses. We expect these businesses to become meaningful contributors to our future growth leading to a further diversification of our revenue mix. In Oncology, the FDA approved ABRAXANE for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer last fall. During the same period, ABRAXANE achieved the primary endpoint of progression-free survival in a Phase III trial for metastatic melanoma marking the first time in decades that a chemotherapeutic agent has shown a clinically superior result compared to a standard of care in that disease. Shortly after achieving these results, ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival in a Phase III trial for metastatic pancreatic cancer. We believe these findings further differentiate

Our business model is delivering significant leverage off our global infrastructure and an increasing rate of return on our invested capital. We are making effective internal and external investments resulting in increased value to our shareholders.

ABRAXANE from other chemotherapeutics and form the basis for future development in combination with novel agents across a range of cancers. Based on the results in pancreatic cancer, we are submitting for regulatory approvals globally that enable patients to begin benefiting from this therapy. In Inflammation and Immunology (I&I), apremilast achieved positive results in five Phase III trials spanning over 3,000 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate-to-severe psoriasis. These large, underserved markets are in need of new treatment options. Earlier this year, we submitted an NDA in the U.S. for PsA and plan to submit regulatory filings globally for PsA and psoriasis during the second half of the year. Beyond the initial indications, we are evaluating apremilast in a Phase III trial for ankylosing spondylitis and in other debilitating inflammatory conditions, such as Behçet's disease. We believe apremilast has significant commercial potential and will serve as the cornerstone for our emerging I&I business.

Sustaining Innovation and Long-Term Growth
Every day we recognize the value and benefit of operating a science-based business in a favorable policy environment--creating a vital culture of innovation. This is truly fundamental to the success of Celgene and is supported by our powerful and unique Research and Development capability, with industry-leading expertise in hematology, oncology and immunology. We are focused on leveraging our core capabilities-- IMiD® technology, epigenetics, kinase inhibitors, tumor progenitors, cellular therapeutics, and AvilomicsTM protein silencing--with complementary strategic collaborations to accelerate drug discovery. Over the last two years alone we and our partners have filed seven investigational new drug (IND) applications. Medical innovation is at the heart of what we do and is the embodiment of our actions that help patients live longer, better lives, while reducing the burden on the healthcare system. The continued progress of our research efforts has already brought about medical

advancements that have changed the treatment paradigm in critical blood cancers. That success has, in turn, enabled us to grow a rich pipeline consisting of 19 programs in preclinical development and 16 therapies being evaluated in over 100 clinical trials. During the last year we advanced next-generation immunomodulatory candidates, CC-122 and CC-220, into human testing. We established an effective dose for CC-292, a highly selective Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor that could be complementary to our REVLIMID programs in NHL and CLL. Our oral epigenetic therapy, CC-486, advanced into Phase III programs for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia. During 2013, we will advance CC-486 into Phase II trials evaluating different priming strategies in solid tumors. In connection with our partner, Acceleron Pharma, Inc., multiple Phase II trials began with ACE-011 and ACE-536 in a variety of severe forms of anemia. We are excited about these programs and how they can produce the next breakthrough therapies.

on the key success factors that validate our business model and lead to sustainable, long-term growth. We know what we do well, what our competitive advantages are, and how to leverage them to capture longterm value. We are making exceptional progress building a leading global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and discovering new innovative therapies in the areas of cancer and inflammatory diseases that make a real difference in the lives of patients. As Celgene grows, we have rigorous and robust discussions about how to retain the character and culture of our company--remaining bold, willing to take smart and appropriate risks and focused on applying our expertise to benefit patients. Every day, Celgene employees are thinking about what we can do better, how we can further expand on and improve our unique value proposition. That is our mission. It unifies us and serves as our vision, as does our keen awareness that there is no success for Celgene if we do not continue to make an increasingly meaningful difference in the lives of the patients we serve. What Celgene does matters to people in a profound way. There is nothing more gratifying than when recipients of our therapies--some of whom you have read about in the preceding pages--say that we have given them their lives back. I have never been more optimistic about where our company is heading. Celgene is on the move.

Outlook to 2017
The remarkable positive results across multiple milestones achieved last year position Celgene to have three new products with blockbuster potential and two emerging businesses that will help serve as the engine for our continued growth for the next five years. Our increasingly diversified revenue mix provides the foundation for sustainable growth going forward. Each milestone accomplished strengthens our conviction in achieving the 2017 financial targets of over $12 billion in net product sales and $13.00 to $14.00 in adjusted earnings per share.

Summary
At Celgene, we are excited by what has been accomplished and even more energized about what will be achieved over the next several years. We are focused Robert J. Hugin
