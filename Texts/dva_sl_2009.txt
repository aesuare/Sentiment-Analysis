        Dear Stakeholders:
2009 represents the last year in DaVita’s first decade. I will first discuss our 2009 results and then provide a few thoughts on the future.
We had a strong year in 2009.
• Clinical outcomes were once again among the best or were the best in virtually every category compared to national averages and we significantly advanced our clinical care initiatives,
• We delivered strong growth in operating profits, earnings and cash flows,
• We successfully completed the five year term of the Gambro Corporate Integrity Agreement and are no longer subject to its restrictions,
• We continued to lead the dialysis community in working with CMS on the rules for the bundled reimbursement set to begin in 2011, and
• We strengthened our senior team, including the addition of Dr. Mahesh Krishnan as Vice President of DaVita Clinical Research and Dr. John Moran as Vice President of Clinical Affairs–Home Modalities.
Clinical Outcomes and Clinical Care Initiatives:
DaVita and its affiliated physicians collaborated to achieve outstanding clinical outcomes in 2009. For the 9th straight year these were the best patient outcomes in our history. At the end of the year:
• 65% of our patients had an arteriovenous fistula placed for dialysis,
• 84% of our patients achieved an albumin level of 3.5 or better,
• 95% of our patients achieved a Kt/V of 1.2 or better,
• 64% of our patients had a 90-day hemoglobin level between 10 and 12, and
• 76% of our patients achieved a calcium phosphorus product <55, the best results ever for management of metabolic bone disease.
Our patients’ 2008 gross mortality rate improved for the third straight year to 16.5%, an 11% improvement from our 2005 mortality rate of 18.5%.
These results compare quite favorably to those reported publicly for other providers.
In 2010 we will continue our Relentless Pursuit of Quality with an intense focus on further improving vascular access and survival, while continuing to improve outcomes in all important areas of patient care.
Net income was $423 million and earnings per share were $4.06, representing a 13% increase in net income and a 15% increase in earnings per share as compared to 2008. Our year-end stock price of $58.74 was an 18% increase over our closing price on December 31, 2008.
Financial:

Growth:
Public Policy:
Cash flow from operations was $667 million and free cash flow was $485 million(1). These strong cash flows allowed us to repurchase 2.9 million shares of common stock for $153 million and spend $248 million for center developments and acquisitions. Our balance sheet is strong with an end of year leverage ratio of 2.56 times debt to trailing 12 month earnings before interest and taxes(1).
We provided 17 million dialysis treatments this year, a 4.9% increase from 2008. Our 2009 non-acquired growth was 4.6% year-over-year.
The implementation of a bundled Medicare payment system in January 2011 represents the biggest change to dialysis reimbursement in recent history. The preliminary rules proposed by CMS in September 2009 represent a payment reduction significantly greater than the 2% Congress intended in its 2008 MIPPA legislation. The dialysis community continues to work with CMS to ensure that the final bundling rules provide adequate reimbursement for the dialysis community, and we await the release of the final rules in 2010.
While adapting to the new reimbursement rules creates some short term pressure, MIPPA provides for a much needed annual inflation adjustment for payments beginning in 2012. Additionally, we will work hard to innovate in the $1.1 billion dollars of cost that is moving to the bundle, to find ways to reduce costs while maintaining or improving clinical quality.
As in the past, we continue to seek to build strong relationships with key government stakeholders, including CMS and within Congress, and develop alternative reform proposals for consideration. In 2010, we will continue to seek to improve the care we deliver to our patients while seeking to partner with the government to enhance the longevity of the Medicare Trust Fund.
Being a leader in American healthcare means being a responsible corporate community. Community Care, DaVita’s vision for social responsibility, is our philosophy for balancing our business responsibilities with our social, economic and environmental ones. Over the past decade, DaVita has had a vision for creating a true community—one that cares for our teammates as well as our patients. This investment in creating a community has inspired our teammates to realize their full potential and to deliver superior quality care to our patients.
Our Community Care programs, including several examples below, enrich the lives of our more than 118,000 patients and 34,000 teammates and their families.
• Bridge of Life—DaVita Medical Missions works with DaVita teammates who volunteer to provide quality dialysis and kidney care to underserved parts of the world.
• Tour DaVita and DaVita Kidney Awareness Run/Walks raise money and awareness to support the Kidney TRUST in its mission to increase kidney disease education and testing.
Corporate Citizenship:

Outlook:
• DaVita and our teammates reach out to support underprivileged communities at home through Village Service Days and investment in our Minority Bank Initiative.
• DaVita’s Village Green program focuses on reducing waste in our centers and corporate offices, as we strive to be strong stewards of the natural world around us.
We invite you to review our work and be inspired to help change your community. Our 2009 Community Care Responsibility Report will be available on DaVita.com later this quarter.
In 2009, the last year of DaVita’s first decade, we delivered strong performance to all our stakeholders.
Looking forward to our next decade, we face significant challenges and opportunities.
If the final Medicare bundling rules are unfavorable, this would lead us and other providers to close dialysis centers in locations where there is not sufficient commercial insurance reimbursement to subsidize the losses we face from Medicare patients. We, along with the dialysis community, continue to work with CMS to ensure that this scenario does not happen.
Bundling implementation poses short term challenges as we adapt, but it also provides a longer term incentive to innovate to reduce the cost of care while maintaining or even increasing clinical quality—providing value for patients, taxpayers, and our shareholders.
In the coming years, our suite of value-added businesses including DaVita Rx, Lifeline, and Village Health positions us for a world with increasingly integrated care. Congress and CMS have been looking to create programs to improve care for chronic conditions. The establishment of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in the 2010 healthcare reform legislation provides such an opportunity. Our developed capabilities will hopefully allow us to be a significant player in the collective efforts to improve care and generate savings for taxpayers.
Once again, I offer heartfelt thanks to our 34,000 teammates for your accomplishments. Your resilience and tenacity in simultaneously meeting the needs of so many diverse constituencies is remarkable.
Respectfully submitted,
Kent J. Thiry Chairman and CEO
