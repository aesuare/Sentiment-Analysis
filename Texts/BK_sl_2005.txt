2005 ANNUAL REPORT 3

Letter to Shareholders

Nearly 20 years ago, The Bank of New York made a commitment to the servicing and fiduciary sectors of the financial services industry as its primary vehicles for future growth. Today, these businesses account for more than two-thirds of our earnings, and they are clearly the centerpiece of our planning for the future.
As I summarize for you where we are today and where we are going tomorrow, restating this commitment is the right place to begin.
Benefiting from a Growing Marketplace

Here's how we look at our future. Our central belief is that the global securities markets will remain open, vibrant and inventive in supporting and encouraging capital flow around the world. As a result, we expect our servicing and fiduciary businesses to grow substantially for the foreseeable future, generating attractive profits and returns on investment. We also expect these businesses to benefit from consolidation, with growth, market share and profitability accruing to the consolidators ­ and leading to the above-average returns that investors expect. The Bank of New York is today a leading participant across the full range of these businesses. As we go forward, we intend to be one of the consolidators. To do so, we plan to win more than our share of the head-to-head competitions for new business that take place daily around the world. And we are committed to maintaining the confidence of the clients that we have won. We intend to accomplish this by building deep client relationships; by providing superior service, effective technology and innovative, market-responsive products; and by adhering to a culture of corporate responsibility founded on ethical business behavior, respect for the

individual and an enduring commitment to the communities we serve. Together, we believe these qualities are what fuel organic growth. And when we make acquisitions, these qualities should help retain the clients we acquire. These qualities exemplify our commitment to all of our constituents and define the business philosophy that drives our long-term growth aspirations. In the near term, this philosophy manifests itself in two strategies: First, to create our own growth and, second, to thoughtfully re-engineer the ways in which we do business. The first is designed to lead us to revenue growth and to greater market share in our core businesses. The second is intended to lead us to well-managed costs and positive operating leverage ­ revenues rising more rapidly than costs. Implicit in both are superior execution and client service, and the use of business practices that are transparent to all.
Performance Highlights

The year just completed was one of great progress for The Bank of New York. We achieved the earnings goals we set forth at the beginning of the year, finished the infrastructure build-out that is required to sustain our business and, of great importance, began to deliver positive operating leverage. For the full year 2005, net income was $1.571 billion compared to $1.440 billion in 2004 while earnings per share

were up 10% to $2.03 from $1.85 in 2004. Total revenues of $6.865 billion were up 9% from the prior year. We achieved positive year-over-year operating leverage in the third and fourth quarters. Capital ratios remained strong, and at yearend were handily above our targets for Tier I, Total Capital and the TCE ratio, which provides us with good capital flexibility for 2006. Our strong, broad-based financial performance enabled us to increase our quarterly dividend. The year-over-year earnings increase was driven by particularly strong results in many core business areas. Investor services fees rose 15%, benefiting from new client wins and strong organic growth. Broker-dealer services had another standout performance, with fees increasing 11% due to rising adoption and utilization of collateral management products. In issuer services, fees grew by 10%, driven by a solid performance in corporate trust and a strengthening environment for depositary receipts. Private client services and asset management fees were up 9%, as our fund of hedge funds products continued to perform well. During the year, we completed our data center configuration, thereby putting related one-time costs behind us and establishing ourselves as a thoroughly resilient company with redundant operations centers. While taking steps to put many of the pending regulatory and legal matters behind us, we bolstered our legal and compliance staffs and enhanced our efforts to raise the degree of oversight and standards of performance with the objective of preventing future regulatory problems.
Creating Our Own Growth

First is our ongoing international expansion. We see significant opportunities to accelerate our revenue growth in Europe and Asia, where markets are developing at a robust rate and there is room to increase our market share. In 2005 we formed partnerships with three leading financial services firms in key growth markets: BHF-BANK in Germany, Nordea in the Nordic and Baltic region and Natexis in France. We also formed similar alliances in Australia, Japan and India. By aligning with established local players, we gain access to our partners' institutional clients, giving us immediate sales opportunities. In providing highly complementary, value-added products to their clients, we strengthen our relationships with our partners and set the stage for future collaboration. Our second growth activity is our effort to maximize the value of our technology as a source of both innovation and differentiation. While the rise in our technology spending is abating as we reap the long-term benefits of the investments we have made over the past years, we are focusing a greater percentage of our technology dollars on enhancing the client experience. We are driving product advancement, creating ways to deliver the richest information possible in the fastest possible manner, making that data easy to work with and ensuring that the user experience is as friendly as possible. Our third opportunity for creating growth is our targeted product expansion activity. Here, our focus is to complement internal product development with select acquisitions that add new institutional clients, create new revenue streams and capitalize on cross-sell opportunities within our existing client base. This year we acquired Lynch, Jones & Ryan, the market leader in commission recapture. In the process, we gained 1,400 pension fund clients who are natural prospects for services such as transition management. We also continued building out our asset management capabilities, capitalizing on the significant and continuing success of Ivy Asset

A catalyst for our good results in 2005 was one of our key strategies ­ creating our own growth ­ which means expecting to perform even better than the market and taking tangible and explicit steps toward that goal. Let me single out a few activities that illustrate how we are delivering on this objective.

Management's fund of hedge funds investment offering in the rapidly growing area of alternative investing. After purchasing Alcentra Group Limited, which added structured credit to our platform, this January we announced plans to purchase Urdang Capital Management, Inc., which offers management services for private real estate investments and portfolios of real estate investment trust securities. Together, these efforts are designed to strengthen client relationships, build market share, add new revenue streams and create our own growth.
Achieving Positive Operating Leverage

Looking Ahead

With the true earnings potential of our franchise becoming steadily more apparent, we entered 2006 with energy and optimism. We foresee moderate but solid economic growth and continued momentum in the capital markets. In addition, we expect to benefit from our success in putting major corporate expenses behind us, slowing the rate of growth in pension expenses and continuing our re-engineering programs. We believe we are well positioned to become a more important partner with our existing clients, to win more than our share of new business, to seize growth opportunities in attractive global markets and to achieve our goal of generating positive operating leverage on a consistent basis. Our performance in 2005 reflects the support, insight and strategic leadership provided by our Board of Directors. We offer our gratitude to Alan R. Griffith, who retired in June as vice chairman after 41 years of service, including 15 years on the Board. We welcome Richard C. Vaughan, retired executive vice president and chief financial officer of Lincoln National Corporation, who joined our Board of Directors in October. On behalf of our Board of Directors and senior management, I would like to offer my appreciation to our staff, an exceptional group of people who have made this company their own and, consequently, made it stronger. They join me in expressing gratitude to our shareholders for their continued confidence in us and in pledging their commitment to realizing our growth potential in the days ahead.

Beyond simply managing our costs carefully, which we continue to do, we are actively re-engineering our business to increase productivity and improve margins. One example is our targeted relocation of staff to lower-cost locations in the U.S. and around the world. This not only reduces our cost base but also geographically aligns our staff with our global clientele. Efforts like these are critical to achieving positive operating leverage on a consistent basis.
Demonstrating Corporate Responsibility

Corporate responsibility is an essential criterion in the selection of an employer, a business partner and a service provider. We support an atmosphere of diversity and inclusiveness, a commitment to investing in our communities and a culture where business ethics are beyond question ­ all of which are fundamental to The Bank of New York's corporate culture and the best possible reflection of our corporate values. During 2005 we took important steps to formalize the structure and governance of our corporate responsibility programs and identified targeted goals for program expansion, including enhanced work/life benefits for our employees. We expect these efforts to make The Bank of New York a more attractive place to work and a more valued business partner.
