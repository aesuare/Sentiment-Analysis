how I know we can achieve our goal.

When we created our gas business several years ago, financial markets did not understand or properly value the gas assets and operations of CONSOL Energy. In the two years since we established CNX Gas as a public company, its visibility and transparency have improved, and financial markets appear to have a greater appreciation for its value, as evidenced by the

significant growth in the market capitalization of CNX Gas.

More importantly, the new initiative addresses several cultural issues that are central to our goal of becoming an accident free company. The first is the recognition that the incremental approach to safety improvement is no longer acceptable. Annual, incremental improvement in most areas of our business is a proven way to create value for shareholders. But in the area of safety performance, incremental improvement is, in effect, a goal where people still get hurt even when the goal is achieved. The only acceptable performance goal in this area is zero accidents.

cal grade coal is prized by steelmakers around the world and commands a premium price. However, it is important to note that when the roof fall and the related ignition of gas occurred, our well-trained, professional work force, immediately evacuated the mine without a single injury. Moreover, the detailed plan developed by our engineers for dealing with the aftermath of the event minimized damage to the mine's infrastructure and equipment. We have resumed limited production at Buchanan, and expect to resume full production before the end of the first quarter.

United States.

The other cultural issue is a personal one. To achieve the company goal of zero accidents, it is axiomatic that every employee must be at zero. We have enlisted more than 200 employees from all parts of the company, whom we call mentors, to talk with other employees about their personal experiences and why being safe is important to them. We ask employees to find within themselves their reason for being safe and to make a personal commitment to being "At Zero" Several other mines, however, enjoyed record production years. Enlow Fork, Loveridge and Robinson Run Mines all set production records. Enlow Fork produced 11.2 million clean tons, the most ever for an underground coal mine in the United States. Productivity, as measured in tons produced per man-day, was at a five year high, and financial margins on a ton of coal sold were nearly $7.00.

Our investment in CNX Gas Corporation continued to pay benefits to our shareholders. By continuing to grow production even as gas prices continued to rise, CNX Gas reported net income of $136 million and increased proven reserves of gas to more than 1.3 trillion cubic feet during 2007. CONSOL Energy currently owns 81.7 percent of CNX Gas.

Neither the United States nor the world will turn its back on coal because the energy produced from coal is vital to raising the prosperity of people around the world. But substantially reducing carbon dioxide emissions produced when coal is consumed will become an essential predicate to its continued use. Increasing the portion of gas in the company's energy portfolio is a prudent step to manage the risk associated with carbon con-

performance during 2007 was the establishment of the "Absolute Zero" safety initiative. After decades of targeting "Zero Accidents" as its goal, CONSOL made a dramatic shift in its approach to safety by declaring it was at zero accidents.

CONSOL challenges employees to remain "At Zero", rather than attempting to eliminate accidents, incrementally, as has been traditional. The company is committed to working injury-free, and any accident is now an exception to this core value.

A key benefit of the renewed emphasis on safety in the workplace is the need to attract a new and reliable workforce for CONSOL's mining and non-mining operations. Safety, equipment and mine training as well as employee-development programs were upgraded and expanded during the year, including the establishment of several, full-service training centers strategically located near active operations.

World Consumption and Scrubbers Drive Increased Coal Demand
During 2007, the company entered into two multi-year, multi-million dollar coal supply agreements with scrubbed utilities in the Midwest and the Southeast.
