“The problem before each of us is not only to keep pace with changing conditions, but to keep ahead of them.”
— Jim Casey
UPS Founder
D. Scott Davis
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
jim casey’s words are as appropriate today as they were in 1932 when our nation was in economic turmoil. They capture the philosophy of how UPS operates through changing economic and business conditions. We are resilient and adaptable, with a highly flexible global network that allows our company to meet changing market forces, while creating new solutions to help our customers succeed. At the same time, we never lose sight of the future, taking the steps necessary to ensure UPS remains the world’s leading transportation solutions provider.
Managing through 2008 required all of our skills as the business environment worsened rapidly. At the beginning of the year, global economies and small package markets were expected to grow. However, the U.S. economy weakened, followed by sharply escalating fuel prices. Then the credit crisis erupted, causing substantial slowing of economies outside the United States.
1932
economic weakness restrains Global package Growth
Deteriorating economic conditions led to a 1.3 percent decline in our consolidated package volume, to 3.9 billion pieces. The U.S. recession was apparent in a 2.0 percent decline in our total domestic package volume.

 In contrast, international export volume gains increased by
a market-leading 6.8 percent from 2007 levels, despite the fact that growth was constrained by declines in U.S. imports and slowing global economies in the second half of 2008. The unprecedented run-up in fuel prices precipitated very significant increases in our fuel surcharge rates, resulting in a product mix shift from more expensive premium air services to ground. This trend was apparent throughout our global package operation.
“We are resilient and adaptable ... creating new solutions to help our customers succeed.”
UPS took aggressive steps to address market conditions. We heightened our focus on increasing revenue, adjusted our flexible network to match reduced volume levels, and con- trolled cost by closing facilities, reducing staff, and curtailing spending. We will remain vigilant this year in our efforts to reduce or eliminate additional costs in every area of the enterprise. This includes freezing management salaries, reducing other forms of compensation and suspending the company’s 401(k) match. However, we did not make any changes to our long-standing defined benefit pension plans. These actions will partially offset the impacts to the company from continued economic weakness.
What we did not do was reduce investment for the future.
In the United States we continued the multi-year expansion
of our largest international air facility, called Worldport, in Louisville, Kentucky. In Europe, we finished construction of our package hub in Tamworth, England — our largest ground hub outside the United States — and acquired our authorized service contractor in Romania. In Asia, we opened an air hub in Shanghai and broke ground on a new hub in Shenzhen. We also assumed control of our joint venture in Korea. And we began offering express pickup and delivery services within 16 additional countries across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.

We also invested in other opportunities that will drive growth through enhanced customer relationships and increased exposure of our brand. This included our sponsorship of the beijing olympic games. This effort involved several thousand UPSers handling 19 million items. It was hugely successful and accomplished a great deal for the UPS brand in China. We also became the official logistics and express sponsor of The European Tour, the continent’s most prestigious golf tour, which will enhance brand recognition there and generate new business opportunities.
We believe it is important to continue investing in the business to ensure that we are in an even stronger position when we emerge from this economic downturn.
“We intend to benefit from the challenges as well as the opportunities before us.”
Lastly, UPS moved forward on our commitment to operate
in an environmentally responsible manner. The purchase of 200 hybrid electric and 300 compressed natural gas vehicles expanded UPS’s alternative fuel fleet 30 percent to more than 2,200, the largest such private fleet in the industry. Addition- ally, we were the first in our industry to purchase hydraulic hybrid vehicles — a new, very promising technology that enables significant fuel and emissions reduction.
supply chain & Freight segment maintains positive momentum
In 2008, the Supply Chain & Freight segment built on 2007’s gains. Revenue increased almost 6 percent and adjusted operating margin* improved to 5 percent from 3.9 percent
in 2007, meeting our goal for the year.
The Supply Chain businesses — Forwarding and Logistics — drove the segment’s improvement. In particular, the launch of a new global air freight portfolio at the beginning of the year was very well received. Logistics’ focus on revenue

 management and improved asset utilization also contributed to the segment’s positive results.
UPS Freight, however, struggled to grow in one of the worst
LTL environments in many years. In 2008 a number of fac-
tors culminated in a $548 million goodwill impairment of
this business. UPS Freight was acquired in 2005, when the
economy was much stronger and valuations were higher.
Thereafter, we invested in technology and operational DIL improvements to enhance service and performance, and
expand product offerings.
While customer focus on price has intensified in the
current economy, we believe that our long-term strategy of offering value through a combination of price, service and technology has positioned us well for the time when market conditions improve.
a look at 2009 and beyond
our long-term competitive position in the United States has improved with the departure of a major player — DHL — from the domestic small package market. However, this significant opportunity will not be enough to offset volume losses from weak economic conditions. Until the economy begins to improve, UPS likely will continue to experience the volume declines and the shift in the mix of packages that began a year ago. As a result, 2009 will be even more difficult than 2008.
Despite current challenges, our long-term view continues to be bright as the result of several competitive advantages inherent to our company — such as UPS’s financial strength, global presence, and our unique business model. Let me elaborate.
First, UPS is financially the strongest competitor in the transportation industry. our free cash flow** was $5.5 billion for 2008, and cash from operations was $8.4 billion. UPS carries an AA rating from the major credit rating agencies. This is particularly important today as more customers make it clear that they want a transportation partner who is financially strong and stable for the long term.
This financial strength also rewards our shareowners. We increased our dividend in 2008, marking more than four decades of consecutive quarters in which the dividend was

*Adjustments affecting 2007 pre-tax results include:
a $6.1 billion payment to withdraw 45,000 Teamster employees from a multi-employer pension plan, an impairment charge of $221 million on the accelerated retirement of certain aircraft, a $68 million charge for the special voluntary separation opportunity, and a $46 million charge related to the restructuring and disposal of a European supply chain operation.
Adjustments affecting 2008 pre-tax results include: a $548 million goodwill impairment charge in our UPS Freight unit and a $27 million intangible impairment charge in our European package operations.
Adjusted financial measures exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results. We believe they are an important indicator of our recurring operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing our underlying businesses. We use these adjusted financial measures to determine incentive compensation awards for our management.

either increased or maintained. Regarding stock repurchases, we did slow the pace in the second half of 2008 because the long-term debt market became extremely volatile, and we expect to continue repurchases in 2009 at a significantly slower rate.
“Despite current challenges, our long-term view continues to be bright.”
The second industry advantage that UPS enjoys is our global presence — we are the only competitor with substantial operations in every major region of the world. This diversified presence helps us to create growth opportunities during slow economic times and, when conditions improve, provides us with the infrastructure and ability to capture new volume.
The third competitive advantage that positions UPS well for the long term is our unique business model. All packages — domestic or international, commercial or residential, air or ground — go through one integrated network. This extremely efficient use of assets has allowed UPS to consistently produce industry-leading margins and return on invested capital. We constantly improve this model to extract even more benefits through lower cost, productivity enhancements and efficiency gains.
a Great industry with bright prospects
our industry remains fundamentally sound with enviable growth opportunities over the long term. Global markets are inextricably bound together, so trade is a reality that is not going to disappear. Ultimately, global economic growth will resume, and UPS will be there to benefit from and help promote this growth.
Just-in-time inventory management has become a mainstay for many enterprises because it allows them to reduce operating costs while typically improving service. It creates the need for fast and efficient movement of goods, which plays to UPS’s strength.

These difficult economic times are causing many companies to re-examine their supply chains. our own research shows that the majority of industry leaders recognize that cost savings are inherent in outsourcing their supply chains. yet, only a minority of companies has committed to improve their bottom lines in this manner. Consequently, there is tremendous opportunity for UPS to expand its presence in this area which, in turn, complements our transportation capabilities.
Finally, the Internet continues to grow in importance as a means of creating commerce. Small package shipment is the bond that joins retailer and buyer in this direct-to-consumer business model.
We may look back at 2008 and 2009 as a real test ... a test
of the resiliency and management skill that has been our hallmark for more than 100 years. At some point, the recession will end and the economy will improve. Many companies will not survive. others will emerge damaged and in a weaker competitive position. but a select few will come out leaner, more focused and better positioned to compete and grow ... and I am confident that UPS will be one of those companies.
