Dear Fellow Shareholders:
In fiscal 2013, D.R. Horton, Inc. capitalized on the improvement in the U.S. housing market and strengthened its leading position in the homebuilding industry. For the 12th consecutive fiscal year, we closed more homes than any other homebuilder in the United States. Our profit margins improved dramatically, resulting in our highest pre-tax profit in seven years, and we increased our investments in inventory to prepare for future growth. Our broad geographic base, financial strength and supply of land, lots and homes position us to grow our profits further, while maintaining operational flexibility to respond to changes in economic conditions. Our financial achievements during fiscal 2013 included the following:
• 37% increase in the value of net sales orders;
• 44% increase in total revenues;
• $657.8 million of consolidated pre-tax income, up from $242.9 million in fiscal 2012;
• $4.1 billion of total equity, up from $3.6 billion a year ago; and
• $2.2 billion sales order backlog, up 33% from a year ago.
Our recent financial performance is the result of the tremendous efforts of our homebuilding and financial services teams over several years to prepare our business in advance of the current housing recovery. Our efforts have remained focused on the fundamentals of selling homes, serving our customers and adjusting our product offerings and pricing to meet customer demand, while also controlling our construction, SG&A and financing costs and inventory levels. We have invested in our business by increasing our land and lot supply, opening new communities, expanding our product offerings and entering new markets. During 2013, we introduced the Emerald Homes brand for our higher-end move-up and luxury communities. Emerald Homes has received a positive consumer reception, and more Emerald communities will open in many of our markets in fiscal 2014.
Our strong balance sheet and liquidity position are supporting our financial performance and growth. In fiscal 2013, we raised capital by issuing $1.1 billion of senior notes and increasing the committed capacity of our revolving credit facility to $725 million. Our $913 million of homebuilding cash and our 44.6% ratio of gross homebuilding debt to total capital (36.7% net of cash) provide flexibility for us to invest in our business and take advantage of profitable growth opportunities. After making significant inventory investments in fiscal 2012, we increased our number of homes in inventory and our lot supply by an additional 31% and 18%, respectively, during fiscal 2013, positioning us to achieve our goal of growing our profits in fiscal 2014.
In 2013, housing demand increased modestly and new home inventory levels remained low, resulting in rising home prices in many of our operating markets, with individual markets improving at varying rates. We expect that further growth in housing demand will occur as overall and local economic conditions, especially full-time job growth, improve from current levels. Our company will continue to compete effectively in this environment by building high quality homes that offer compelling value to a broad range of homebuyers and providing excellent service to our customers during their home purchase and financing process as well as after they become new homeowners. Our management team will also continue to operate our business in a capital efficient manner through disciplined management of our land, lot and home inventories and operating costs while maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position.
After completing our 35th year, our market position has never been better, and fiscal 2014 should be another strong year for D.R. Horton, America’s Builder. Our employees are the best in the industry, and their dedication and daily efforts to improve our operations and achieve profitable growth are driving our success. We thank all of our suppliers, subcontractors, real estate agents and lenders for their valuable relationships. Finally, we appreciate our shareholders for your consistent support, as we strive to validate your trust by delivering sustainable value, addressing future challenges directly and remaining a leader in the homebuilding industry.
Donald R. Horton
Chairman of the Board
