hat a difference a year makes! Pent-up demand, rising home prices, low interest rates, and improving consumer confidence motivated buyers to return to the housing market in FY 2012. As household

We believe the publicly traded home building companies are gaining market share: As the only national home building company focused on the luxury market, we are particularly well positioned. Our financial results bear this out.

formations accelerated and unsold home inventories dropped to record lows, the industry took further steps toward a sustained housing recovery.

We enjoyed resurgent activity across all of our product lines and in most of our geographic regions. The momentum that began in our first quarter of FY 2012 built throughout the year. Sequentially, over the four quarters of FY 2012, the value of net signed contracts rose 45%, 51%, 66%, and 75%, compared to FY 2011's same four quarters. Our net contracts per community ("same store sales"), which increased 33% and 60% respectively versus FY 2011's full year and fourth quarter, were the highest for a fiscal year since FY 2006 and the highest for a fourth quarter since FY 2005. Our large increase in contracts was achieved primarily through growth in percommunity sales. FY 2012's contracts per community of 18.2, while up 33% from FY 2011, were still 36% below our average annual pace from 1987 through 2006 of 28.6; therefore, as the economy strengthens, we believe there is great potential to increase sales paces per community. While there has been only a slight increase in traffic over the past few years, it has supported strong contract growth. We are experiencing our highest conversion ratio from visitor to agreement in the history of the Company as the quality of the traffic is superb and visitors are very serious about buying. When traffic returns to more normalized levels, we believe there is a strong possibility of significant growth in contracts and prices.

FY 2012 net income was $487.1 million, or $2.86 per share diluted, compared to FY 2011's net income of $39.8 million, or $0.24 per share diluted. Included in FY 2012's net income was a net tax benefit of $374.2 million, which included the reversal of $394.7 million of our deferred tax asset valuation reserves against our deferred tax asset, offset by a tax provision of $20.5 million. Net income included pre-tax inventory write-downs of $14.7 million and cash recoveries of prior joint venture write-offs of $2.3 million, compared to pre-tax inventory write-downs of $92.7 million and a $3.8 million pre-tax loss from early repurchase of debt in FY 2011. FY 2011 net income also included a net tax benefit of $69.2 million. FY 2012's pre-tax income was $112.9 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $29.4 million in FY 2011.

Backlog of $1.67 billion and 2,569 units rose 70% in dollars and 54% in units, compared to FY 2011's fourth-quarter-end backlog. With our $1.67 billion backlog and the lowest cancellation rate in our industry, we believe we will deliver between 3,600 and 4,400 homes in FY 2013 at an average price of between $595,000 and $630,000 per home. We expect to end FY 2013 with between 225 and 255 selling communities, compared to 224 at FYE 2012.

of 5.875% senior bonds due in February 2022, which raised approximately $300 million in cash, with the remainder used to retire $118 million of earlier maturing notes. In September, we raised $287.5 million through a 20-year exchangeable note offering, callable in September 2017, with a 0.50% coupon and a conversion premium set at $49.08 per share -- 50% above our then-current stock price of $32.72. Our financial strength also gives us an advantage in buying land as sellers know we have the appetite and capital to close transactions quickly. Since the start of our fourth quarter, we have been seeing great deal flow in some excellent locations.

"Our strong credit ratings have enabled us to access the capital markets on industry-leading terms."
We ended FY 2012 with approximately $3.12 billion of stockholders' equity, $1.22 billion of cash and marketable securities, $815 million available under our 12-bank credit facility, and a net debt-to-capital ratio of 23.6%. Our financial strength gives us a competitive advantage over the small and mid-sized private builders in our luxury niche whose access to capital and land remains constrained. Our strong credit ratings have enabled us to access the capital markets on industryleading terms. By laddering our debt maturities over many years, repaying or extending maturing debt well before it was due, and accumulating cash, we were able to avoid the liquidity crunch that punished many companies across many industries during the recent financial crisis. In February 2012, we issued $420 million

Our philosophy has always been to acquire exceptionally located sites -- on the corner of "Main and Main." In contrast to the just-in-time model of some land-light builders, we often take this land through approvals while we have it under option and then improve it. This helps increase our profit margins and enables us to position the Company for the future as we put land under control today that may translate into revenues starting several years later. With a strong presence in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, we naturally felt some effects in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. While the impact on our business was minimal, our associates were incredibly generous with their time and resources as they and the Company donated food, clothing, equipment, and money to aid the recovery in the towns and cities where we operate and live. We are proud of our team's response as our thoughts go out to those who have suffered from this tragic event. As the economy slowly heals and more customers reenter the housing market, we look forward to the future. Based on our strong balance sheet, solid land holdings,
