* Entering 1999, your Company is primed to embark on a new phase of growth. Although we expect competition to be intense in Las Vegas and certain high-end Asian business to be negatively affected as a result of that region's economic conundrum, the proactive initiatives that we introduced over the past few years should help us offset these conditions. In addition, our expansion into Detroit affords us the geographic diversification that is so critical in a period of temporary over-capacity in the Las Vegas market. * The fundamentals of MGM Grand remain strong. We have a top-notch management team, motivated cast members dedicated to providing grand-class service, a healthy balance sheet and a brand strategy that has enduring value. We are confident that these strengths will allow us to leverage our franchise worldwide and to create wealth for our shareholders.
