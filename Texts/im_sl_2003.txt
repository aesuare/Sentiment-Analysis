It was just 25 years ago that the PC was introduced and a new technology distribution company called Micro D opened its doors. Imagine--the fledgling Kent Foster distributor started with just three vendors: Atari, Commodore and Texas Instruments. As it grew, the company stayed focused on its vision to be the best at bringing technology to market. Today that company is Ingram Micro--a sales, marketing and logistics powerhouse connecting hundreds of thousands of products and services to thousands of resellers around the world, every day.
After 25 years we are still true to our mission--to help resellers and vendors become more profitable. We do this by acting as the catalyst for business growth for the technology industry, broadening our customers' reach into dispersed markets and using our operations to help them do business more effectively than they can on their own. And as technology continues to play an integral role in the way people live, our role becomes even more vital.

The program generated approximately $176 million in annualized operating income improvements--surpassing the $160 million estimated when we announced the program in September 2002--and costs of $139 million were within our original estimate of $140 million. The success of the profit enhancement program is the key achievement of 2003. As we enter what I believe will be a vibrant future for technology, I am pleased to report that the financial position of the company is sound. We ended 2003 on a high note --despite relatively flat sales of $22.6 billion, income before cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting standard was $149.2 million versus $5.7 million in 2002.

( 1 ) All balance sheet data are given at end of period. (2) Excludes special items, reorganization costs and other major-program costs charged to selling, general and administrative expenses, and cost of sales incurred in implementing our comprehensive profit enhancement program and additional profit enhancement opportunities. Please refer to Schedule 1 for more detailed information and reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures. (3) Excludes items noted in footnote (2) above as well as gains on sales of available-for-sale securities; gains (losses) on repurchases of debentures, net of income taxes; the reversal of a deferred tax liability related to the gain on sale of available for sale securities in 2003 (see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements); and cumulative effect of adoption of a new accounting standard in 2002 (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements). Please refer to Schedule 1 for more detailed information and reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures.

Adding to that success, our 2003 net income also included a benefit of $70.5 million in the third quarter for the reversal of previously-accrued U.S. Federal income taxes related to the sale of a portion of our Softbank common stock in 1999. And, a look at our balance sheet shows that our debt ratios remained strong, even with higher sales. Our debt to capitalization ratio was 16 percent--a record low. 3
