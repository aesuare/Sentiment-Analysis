To Our Shareholders

David H. Hannah
Once again, we are very pleased to report our best-ever financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. We completed five acquisitions during 2007 that, along with the 2006 acquisitions of Earle M. Jorgensen Company and Yarde Metals, Inc., contributed significantly to our record results. Our 2007 acquisitions along with our internal growth initiatives were important in further expanding and diversifying our product, customer and geographic base, both domestically and internationally. We expect to continue to grow the Company in 2008 and are well positioned to do so, with ready access to capital.
For the 2007 year, net income was a record $408.0 million, up 15% compared with
net income of $354.5 million for the same period in 2006. Earnings per diluted share were $5.36 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2007, compared with earnings of $4.82 per diluted share for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2006. Sales for the 2007 year were a record $7.26 billion, an increase of 26% compared with 2006 sales of $5.72 billion.
In October of 2007, we expanded our global presence with the acquisition of Metalweb plc (now Metalweb Limited). The metals service center company is headquartered in Birmingham, England, and has three additional service centers located in London, Manchester and Oxford, England. Metalweb was established in 2001 and specializes in the processing and distribution of primarily aluminum products for non-structural aerospace components and general engineering parts used in high-end industrial applications. Metalweb’s sales for the three months ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $12 million. Metalweb increases our European presence and better positions us to meet the increasing challenges and opportunities resulting from the globalization of our customers.
In July of 2007, we acquired Clayton Metals, Inc. headquartered in Wood Dale, Illinois. Clayton Metals was founded in 1976 and specializes primarily in the processing and distribution of aluminum, stainless steel and red metal flat-rolled products, custom extrusions and aluminum circles through its metals service center locations in Wood Dale, Illinois; Cerritos, California; High Point, North Carolina; and Parsippany, New Jersey. Clayton Metals’ sales for the six-months ended December 31, 2007 were approximately $54 million.
In February of 2007, we acquired the Encore Group of metals service center companies (Encore Metals, Encore Metals (USA), Inc., Encore Coils, and Team Tube in Canada) headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. In January of 2008, we sold the assets and

In December of 2007, we announced that our subsidiary, Valex Corp. opened a facility

business of the Encore Coils division that processed and distributed carbon steel flat-rolled products through four facilities located in Western Canada. We continue to operate one of the Encore Coils locations as a toll processor. We also continue to own and operate Encore Metals and Team Tube, which specialize in the processing and distribution of alloy and carbon bar and tube, as well as stainless steel sheet, plate and bar through 13 facilities located mainly in Western Canada. Encore’s sales (including the Encore Coils division) were approximately $208 million for the eleven-months ended December 31, 2007. Encore’s emphasis on specialty long products and exposure to the energy market in Western Canada added further to our diversification strategy in a robust market area.
In January of 2007, we acquired Crest Steel Corporation, a metals service center company
 headquartered in Carson, California. Crest was founded in 1963 and has facilities in Riverside,

We relocated some existing operations into new, larger, more efficient facilities and we added over $55 million of processing and handling equipment to enhance our value-add and quick turnaround services to our customers. We also purchased land for further expansion in 2008. We continue to be excited about our internal growth opportunities and have budgeted capital expenditures of $210 million in 2008 to support this growth.
We also expect to continue to grow the Company through acquisitions. Our strong financial position and ready access to capital will allow us to quickly respond to attractive opportunities for additional accretive acquisitions that meet our stringent criteria.
In 2007 we managed our working capital well which, when combined with our record profits, resulted in operating cash flow of $639 million. We used this cash flow to fund our $124 million of capital expenditures, $270 million of acquisitions, and $82 million of stock repurchases. Our net debt-to-total capital at December 31, 2007 was 32.4% and outstanding borrowings on our $1.1 billion credit facility were $185 million.
In 2007, during a period when our stock price was under pressure, we repurchased about
$408.0
1.7 million shares of our common stock at an average cost of $49.10 per share under our
$354.5
