The U.S. economy took only modeststeps toward recovery, while the U.S. stock marketstraded up and down and the unemployment rateremained at near double-digit levels.Despite this turbulence, the people at Dominionremained true to our four core values — safety, ethics,excellence and teamwork. These principles are thebackbone of our corporate structure and culture. Managementand employees alike strictly adhere to them.Never forget that the daily tasks of many of our employeesare dangerous — from repairing power and gaslines to operating power stations and gas compressors.That is why safety ranks first on our list. We are proudthat our U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’srecordable incident rate of 0.95 incidents per100 employees in 2010 represented a 17 percentreduction from 2009, and 77 percent from 2003. Infact, all three of our operating units demonstratedsuperior safety performance in 2010. Dominionconsistently ranked in the top quartile of companiesin the Southeast Electric Exchange in employee safetyperformance during 2010.Our customer value and satisfaction rankings atDominion Transmission show without a doubt whatour people can do. For the fifth year, our gas pipelinebusiness unit was ranked first in customer value andcustomer satisfaction among its primary Northeastcompetitors, according to a 2010 study by Missouribasedconsultant Mastio & Co. Nationwide, DominionTransmission ranked third in customer value andfifth in customer satisfaction among pipelines with atleast 3,500 miles of transmission pipeline and deliveriesof at least 1 trillion cubic feet of gas.Thanks to dedicated employees throughoutDominion, your company has substantially completed􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀓 􀀶􀁘􀁐􀁐􀁄􀁕􀁜 􀀤􀁑􀁑􀁘􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁓􀁒􀁕􀁗 􀀧􀀲􀀰􀀬􀀱􀀬􀀲􀀱 􀀵􀀨􀀶􀀲􀀸􀀵􀀦􀀨􀀶 􀀚􀀷􀁒􀁗􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁗􀁘􀁕􀁑 􀀦􀁒􀁐􀁓􀁄􀁕􀁌􀁖􀁒􀁑 􀀳􀁈􀁕􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁗 􀁗􀁋􀁕􀁒􀁘􀁊􀁋 􀀧􀁈􀁆􀁈􀁐􀁅􀁈􀁕 􀀖􀀔􀀏􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀓􀀐􀀛􀀑􀀖􀀔􀀘􀀑􀀔􀀔􀀕􀀑􀀓􀀐􀀗􀀑􀀚􀀐􀀔􀀖􀀑􀀘􀀔􀀗􀀑􀀔􀀙􀀑􀀘􀀔􀀗􀀑􀀛􀀖􀀑􀀕􀀖􀀘􀀑􀀜􀀕􀀔􀀑􀀔 􀀕􀀖􀀑􀀘􀀧􀀲􀀰􀀬􀀱􀀬􀀲􀀱 􀀧􀁒􀁚 􀀭􀁒􀁑􀁈􀁖 􀀸􀁗􀁌􀁏􀁌􀁗􀁜 􀀧􀀭􀀬􀀤 􀀶􀀉􀀳 􀀘􀀓􀀓􀀔 􀀼􀁈􀁄􀁕􀀷􀁒􀁗􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁗􀁘􀁕􀁑􀀖 􀀼􀁈􀁄􀁕􀀷􀁒􀁗􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁗􀁘􀁕􀁑􀀘 􀀼􀁈􀁄􀁕􀀷􀁒􀁗􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁗􀁘􀁕􀁑Source: Bloombergits five-year transition to a company whose operatingearnings are more firmly tied to regulated operations.This transition has positioned us to embark on a fiveyear,$10-plus billion growth plan to meet the longtermenergy needs of our customers.􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀓 􀀩􀀬􀀱􀀤􀀱􀀦􀀬􀀤􀀯 􀀳􀀨􀀵􀀩􀀲􀀵􀀰􀀤􀀱􀀦􀀨In 2010, Dominion earned $3.34 per share in operatingearnings, up from $3.27 per share in 2009, well abovethe midpoint of our original 2010 guidance range of$3.20 per share to $3.40 per share.* Because of strongfinancial performance, the bottom end of that range increasedtwice during the year to $3.30 per share. Earningsunder Generally Accepted Accounting Principles(GAAP) in 2010 were $4.76, up from $2.17 per sharein 2009. The difference between operating and GAAPearnings for 2010 was attributable primarily to the saleof our Appalachian natural gas exploration and productionoperations, which I will discuss later.In 2010, our total shareholder return — that is, ourstock’s price change over a given year, plus dividends— amounted to 14.8 percent. Our return to investorsbested that of the Dow Jones Utility Average, a groupof 15 utility stocks including Dominion, which returned6.5 percent. Your company’s total return edgedthat of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a major generalmarket index, which posted a 14.1 percent return,and slightly trailed that of the S&P 500, another majorgeneral market index, which produced a 15.1 percenttotal return.Last year, Dominion returned $1.83 per share individends to shareholders, a 4.6 percent increase over2009. That increase followed 11 percent dividend ratehikes in both 2008 and 2009.We have accomplished the key elements we wantedto achieve when we started our transformation in2006.

At thetime, there was a growing gap in our Virginia franchisearea between demand and available generation — anduncertainty in putting vast amounts of capital intonew infrastructure projects.We were producing largeamounts of natural gas and oil in wells across the U.S.,the Gulf of Mexico and Canada, adding commodityprice exposure and volatility to our earnings and theneed for significant credit capacity and cash to coverhedging programs. Three-fifths of Dominion’s operatingearnings were derived from commodity-basedbusinesses, such as gas and oil exploration and production(E&P) and power stations in the Northeast sellingelectricity into non-regulated markets. That percentagewas expected to increase.Investors asked, Is Dominion a utility? An E&Pcompany? An independent power producer? Our priceto-earnings ratio — a common metric to value a stock— reflected those concerns. Back then our P/E valuationwas at a 12 percent discount to the average P/Eratio of the 14 companies we identified as representingour peer group.*􀀷􀀫􀀨 􀀕􀀓􀀓􀀙 􀀳􀀯􀀤􀀱Seeking to alleviate investor concerns, senior managementunveiled a plan whose philosophy was simple:Reduce risk by shifting the operating earnings mix tofocus on regulated businesses and decreasing earningssensitivity to commodity prices.We developed a strategy to grow federal- and stateregulatedassets. In the Virginia General Assembly,Dominion supported a regulatory model that allowedthe State Corporation Commission to set customers’rates while providing forward-looking cost-recoverymechanisms and performance incentives for new infrastructureto meet rising demand. We considered selling* As of December 31, 2010, our peer companies consisted of Ameren, AEP,Constellation Energy Group, DTE Energy, Duke Energy, Entergy, Exelon,FirstEnergy, NextEra Energy, NiSource, PPL, Progress Energy, PublicService Enterprise Group, and Southern Company.

This wouldsupport a strong balance sheet, stable credit ratings,and the ability to provide investors with competitiveutility dividends.􀀨􀀻􀀨􀀦􀀸􀀷􀀬􀀱􀀪 􀀷􀀫􀀨 􀀳􀀯􀀤􀀱To execute our plan, the company in 2007 divestedour non-Appalachian E&P assets for nearly $14 billion.The after-tax proceeds reduced outstanding debtby $3.3 billion and also allowed us to repurchase morethan $5.8 billion of common stock, more than 18percent of the total shares outstanding as of December31, 2006. Further, as the Virginia General Assemblypassed legislation in 2007 to reregulate the state’s electricutilities and provide premium returns on equityfor critical infrastructure investments, the companyfocused its efforts on a build-out to serve ourcustomers’ needs.Management continued to reduce commodity andmerchant risk and evaluate remaining business lines toensure that they met our targets for actual and potentialROIC.As a result, last year we sold the remainder of ourE&P operations in the Appalachian region for nearly$3.5 billion, including hundreds of thousands of acresholding Marcellus Shale, one of the largest recoverablegas discoveries in recent years. Because of our pipelineand storage system’s strong presence throughout theMarcellus Shale region, we believed it made betterbusiness sense to sell our production interests thereand instead renew our focus on energy infrastructure.Shareholder capital, we concluded, had more value inimproving existing infrastructure and building newproducts extraction facilities, gathering, storage, andtransmission pipelines — infrastructure that wouldhelp producers more effectively and efficiently getnatural gas to demand centers.The Appalachian E&P transaction reduced ouroverall, companywide commodity exposure by an additional20 percent and annual capital expenditures by$250 million.We used the after-tax proceeds to offset2010 and 2011 equity needs, buy back common stock,pay down debt and make a contribution to our pensionplan.Based on ROIC considerations, we also closed onthe sale of Dominion Peoples, a gas local distributioncompany serving parts of Pennsylvania, for $780 millionand reduced debt with the proceeds. Dominionalso divested its interest in Rumford and Morgantown,two small merchant coal-fired power stations in Maineand West Virginia, respectively.􀀵􀀨􀀶􀀸􀀯􀀷􀀶 􀀲􀀩 􀀲􀀸􀀵 􀀵􀀨􀀳􀀲􀀶􀀬􀀷􀀬􀀲􀀱􀀬􀀱􀀪We have been pleased with the success of our transformationto date. I must admit, however, that timingand, to some extent, luck have played their part. Backin 2006, when we decided to market our non-AppalachianE&P business, we did not know that natural gasand oil prices would plummet or that the Gulf of Mexicowould be home to history’s largest oil spill.

Although new connects dropped toabout 27,000 in 2010, the utility has historically connected48,000 new customer accounts each year. PJMInterconnection, a transmission grid operator servingall or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia,reports that the Dominion Zone has the highest expectedelectric load growth rate — 2.1 percent per year— of the 20 zones it operates. It further forecasts thatover the next decade peak demand growth in Virginiawill be the equivalent of adding 1.1 million additionalhomes to our system.Second, enormous gas deposit finds in the MarcellusShale have started a production rush in WestVirginia and Pennsylvania. Although we sold ourE&P business, we plan to help producers by investingat least $850 million in infrastructure to bring theirMarcellus gas to market.Third, gas and electric distribution systems in Virginia,North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia needto be upgraded and modernized. These aging wiresand pipes must continue to serve customers withoutinterruption and to connect new customers as energydemand grows.􀀳􀀲􀀺􀀨􀀵􀀬􀀱􀀪 􀀹􀀬􀀵􀀪􀀬􀀱􀀬􀀤As I have stated in previous letters, Virginia is oneof the best states for business, according to bothCNBC and Forbes.com. The state is home to many ofAmerica’s largest military installations, and serves halfthe nation’s Internet flow. Because of its proximity toWashington, D.C., Virginia continues to be largelyrecession-resistant. Its economy continues to grow.Three-quarters of our anticipated growth capitalexpenditures from 2011 to 2015 — or approximately$7.4 billion — is slated for generation, transmissionand distribution in the electric utility service area. Thatfigure excludes the more than $5.5 billion alreadyspent from 2006 to 2010 to satisfy demand growth inVirginia and North Carolina.The list of major projects currently in developmentor under construction follows. All of these qualify forenhanced returns on generation, transmission anddistribution investments either as part of the regula􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀓􀀶􀁘􀁐􀁐􀁄􀁕􀁜 􀀤􀁑􀁑􀁘􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁓􀁒􀁕􀁗 􀀧􀀲􀀰􀀬􀀱􀀬􀀲􀀱 􀀵􀀨􀀶􀀲􀀸􀀵􀀦􀀨􀀶 􀀔􀀘􀀵􀁈􀁊􀁘􀁏􀁄􀁗􀁈􀁇 􀀬􀁑􀁉􀁕􀁄􀁖􀁗􀁕􀁘􀁆􀁗􀁘􀁕􀁈 􀀬􀁑􀁙􀁈􀁖􀁗􀁐􀁈􀁑􀁗 􀀧􀁒􀁏􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁖 􀁌􀁑 􀀥􀁌􀁏􀁏􀁌􀁒􀁑􀁖􀀦􀁘􀁐􀁘􀁏􀁄􀁗􀁌􀁙􀁈 􀀳􀁏􀁄􀁑􀁑􀁈􀁇 􀀪􀁕􀁒􀁚􀁗􀁋 􀀦􀁄􀁓􀁌􀁗􀁄􀁏 􀀨􀁛􀁓􀁈􀁑􀁇􀁌􀁗􀁘􀁕􀁈􀁖􀀍􀀕􀀑􀀔􀀗􀀑􀀛􀀙􀀑􀀛􀀛􀀑􀀖􀀔􀀓􀀑􀀔􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀔 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀕 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀖 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀗 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀘*All planned expenditures are preliminary and may be subject to regulatory and/orBoard of Directors approvals.tory compact in Virginia or from the Federal EnergyRegulatory Commission:􀁑􀀃 􀀹􀁌􀁕􀁊􀁌􀁑􀁌􀁄 􀀦􀁌􀁗􀁜 􀀫􀁜􀁅􀁕􀁌􀁇 􀀨􀁑􀁈􀁕􀁊􀁜 􀀦􀁈􀁑􀁗􀁈􀁕 in SouthwestVirginia, a $1.8 billion, 585-megawatt coal- andbiomass-fired station.

Dominionbelieves new nuclear power should be a major part ofthe nation’s energy mix because it is safe, reliable, dependableand efficient — and does not emit pollutantsthat may contribute to climate change. In addition,fuel diversity in electric generation is vital to counteringprice volatility of other fuels.While we have not yet committed to constructingthe new unit, we have selected Mitsubishi HeavyIndustries’ reactor design. Your company will continueto seek a combined construction and operatinglicense (COL) from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,which we expect to obtain in 2013. And we areproceeding with preliminary site work, engineeringand planning activities.

All were ontime and on budget.As the price of natural gas has waned, the demandfor its use as a fuel for electric production has grown.Prospects for new products extraction, gathering, storageand transmission appear great, both for conventionaland, as mentioned previously, Marcellus Shalegas. Over the next five years, we will be investing ininfrastructure to meet the needs of the producer communityand the marketplace.Four projects are planned for transporting MarcellusShale gas — the Northeast Expansion, Marcellus404, Ellisburg to Craigs, and Sabinsville to Morrisville.The Northeast Expansion, Ellisburg to Craigs, and Sa􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀓􀀶􀁘􀁐􀁐􀁄􀁕􀁜 􀀤􀁑􀁑􀁘􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁓􀁒􀁕􀁗 􀀧􀀲􀀰􀀬􀀱􀀬􀀲􀀱 􀀵􀀨􀀶􀀲􀀸􀀵􀀦􀀨􀀶 􀀔􀀚􀀦􀁏􀁈􀁄􀁑􀁈􀁕 􀀤􀁌􀁕 􀁌􀁑 􀀱􀁈􀁚 􀀨􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁄􀁑􀁇 􀀳􀁈􀁕􀁆􀁈􀁑􀁗 􀀳􀁕􀁒􀁍􀁈􀁆􀁗􀁈􀁇 􀁈􀁐􀁌􀁖s􀁌􀁒􀁑􀁖 􀁕􀁈􀁇􀁘􀁆􀁗􀁌􀁒􀁑􀀧􀁒􀁐􀁌􀁑􀁌􀁒􀁑 􀁅􀁈􀁊􀁄􀁑 􀁒􀁚􀁑􀁈􀁕􀁖􀁋􀁌􀁓 􀁒􀁉 􀀧􀁒􀁐􀁌􀁑􀁌􀁒􀁑 􀀱􀁈􀁚􀀨􀁑􀁊􀁏􀁄􀁑􀁇 􀀋􀀥􀁕􀁄􀁜􀁗􀁒􀁑 􀀳􀁒􀁌􀁑􀁗􀀏 􀀰􀁄􀁑􀁆􀁋􀁈􀁖􀁗􀁈􀁕 􀀶􀁗􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁗 􀁄􀁑􀁇􀀶􀁄􀁏􀁈􀁐 􀀫􀁄􀁕􀁅􀁒􀁕 􀀳􀁒􀁚􀁈􀁕 􀀶􀁗􀁄􀁗􀁌􀁒􀁑􀁖􀀌 􀀭􀁄􀁑􀁘􀁄􀁕􀁜 􀀔􀀏 􀀕􀀓􀀓􀀘􀀔􀀜􀀜􀀛 􀀕􀀓􀀓􀀓 􀀕􀀓􀀓􀀕 􀀕􀀓􀀓􀀗 􀀕􀀓􀀓􀀙 􀀕􀀓􀀓􀀛 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀓 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀘􀀶􀀲􀀕 􀀐􀀛􀀙􀀈􀀱􀀲􀁛 􀀐􀀛􀀓􀀈􀀰􀁈􀁕􀁆􀁘􀁕􀁜 􀀐􀀛􀀛􀀈 􀀐􀀔􀀓􀀓􀀐􀀛􀀓􀀐􀀙􀀓􀀐􀀗􀀓􀀐􀀕􀀓􀀓binsville to Morrisville projects have executed contractsfor service, and are in the implementation phase. TheMarcellus 404 project is under development, and weare in the process of securing customers. Dominionhas identified an additional $1.5 billion in potentialgrowth capital for gas transmission projects not includedin the 2011-2015 growth plan.To bolster Dominion East Ohio’s system safety andreliability, we launched a $2.6 billion, 25-year bare steelpipeline replacement program in 2008.

About 70percent of the nation’s electricity comes from burningfossil fuels and combustion of those fossil fuels emitsgases into the atmosphere that contribute to air pollution.In addition, many stations use a large amount ofwater for cooling the turbines that create electricity.The combustion of fossil fuels also creates greenhousegas emissions. While climate change laws appearless certain to come from Congress, debate at the U.S.Capitol could return when our nation’s economyimproves. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,on the other hand, has issued several new greenhousegas regulations and is in the process of issuing additionalregulations.Dominion has spent, or is planning to spend, morethan $3.1 billion on environmental improvements atour merchant and utility generating fleet between 1998and 2015. Already, as a result of these improvements,our mercury, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissionsin the mid-Atlantic and New England regionshave steadily — and dramatically — fallen.Additional new EPA regulations are likely to setnew emissions standards for nitrogen oxides and sulfurdioxide, new standards for handling and disposal ofcoal combustion byproducts such as fly ash, new airtoxic standards for mercury and other hazardous airpollutants, new emissions standards for carbon dioxideand other greenhouse gases, and new standards forcooling water. They could add $2 billion or more inadditional environmental spending in the next fiveyears for Dominion.As the environmental regulatory landscape evolves,we will continue to assess all options to meet bothenvironmental and customer obligations in a way􀀔􀀛 􀀧􀀲􀀰􀀬􀀱􀀬􀀲􀀱 􀀵􀀨􀀶􀀲􀀸􀀵􀀦􀀨􀀶 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀓 􀀶􀁘􀁐􀁐􀁄􀁕􀁜 􀀤􀁑􀁑􀁘􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁓􀁒􀁕􀁗􀀧􀁒􀁐􀁌􀁑􀁌􀁒􀁑 􀁅􀁈􀁏􀁌􀁈􀁙􀁈􀁖 􀁗􀁋􀁄􀁗􀁕􀁈􀁚􀁄􀁕􀁇􀁌􀁑􀁊 􀁗􀁋􀁒􀁖􀁈 􀁚􀁋􀁒 􀁒􀁚􀁑 􀁒􀁘􀁕􀁆􀁒􀁐􀁓􀁄􀁑􀁜 􀁄􀁑􀁇 􀁄􀁕􀁈 􀁄 􀁏􀁄􀁕􀁊􀁈 􀁓􀁄􀁕􀁗􀁒􀁉 􀁌􀁗􀁖 􀁖􀁘􀁆􀁆􀁈􀁖􀁖 􀁌􀁖 􀁌􀁐􀁓􀁒􀁕􀁗􀁄􀁑􀁗􀀑􀀬􀁑 􀁖􀁘􀁐􀀏 􀁒􀁘􀁕 􀁅􀁒􀁄􀁕􀁇 􀁄􀁊􀁕􀁈􀁈􀁖 􀁗􀁋􀁄􀁗􀁌􀁑􀁆􀁕􀁈􀁄􀁖􀁌􀁑􀁊 􀁗􀁋􀁈 􀁇􀁌􀁙􀁌􀁇􀁈􀁑􀁇 􀁌􀁖 􀁗􀁋􀁈􀁕􀁌􀁊􀁋􀁗 􀁗􀁋􀁌􀁑􀁊 􀁗􀁒 􀁇􀁒􀀑that serves the best interests of our shareholders andcustomers. This may involve installation of additionalcontrol equipment, potential early retirement of units,and/or new build or fuel-conversion options.One example of our environmental spending willbe on display this year, when the 500-foot tall coolingtowers at the Brayton Point Power Station in Massachusettsbegin to become operational. The closed-loopcooling towers are designed to reduce water usage inthe Mount Hope Bay by more than 90 percent. Unlikeat many power stations across the country, we had theflexibility — and the land — to add cooling towersand other environmental equipment, such as scrubbers,at Brayton.􀀲􀀸􀀷􀀯􀀲􀀲􀀮 􀀩􀀲􀀵 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀔􀀏 􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀕Considering all these factors, our guidance for 2011anticipates operating earnings in the range of $3.00 pershare to $3.30 per share.*Principal reasons for lower earnings per share guidancein 2011 as compared to 2010 include severalmajor merchant power stations being taken offline formaintenance, refueling and environmental equipmenttie-ins and historically low commodity prices. Indeed,it is possible that 2011 could result in Dominion’s firstyear-over-year operating earnings per share declinesince 2005.At this time, your company expects from 5 to 6percent earnings growth in 2012 and beyond as a resultof fewer merchant outages, commodity price increases,rising energy demand, and construction and operationof new infrastructure in regulated businesses, such aselectric utility generation, transmission and distributionand gas transmission and distribution.􀀩􀀲􀀦􀀸􀀶 􀀲􀀱 􀀧􀀬􀀹􀀬􀀧􀀨􀀱􀀧􀀶In October 2007, the board set a goal of achieving a55 percent dividend payout ratio by 2010. Dominion’sdividend payout ratio in 2010, based on operatingearnings, was 55 percent.**With the continued transition to a regulated modeland the greater predictability that comes from a higherproportion of cash flow and earnings from regulatedoperations, in December 2010 the board set a newdividend policy to pay out 60 to 65 percent of operatingearnings per share to shareholders. The board alsoincreased the annual dividend rate by 14 cents pershare — from $1.83 per share in 2010 to $1.97 pershare in 2011 — subject to quarterly approval by thedirectors. As investors view our company as more of a* See page 20 for GAAP Reconciliation of 2011 OperatingEarnings Guidance.** See page 20 for GAAP Reconciliation of Operating Dividend PayoutRatio (non-GAAP) to Reported Dividend Payout Ratio (GAAP).􀀕􀀓􀀔􀀓 􀀶􀁘􀁐􀁐􀁄􀁕􀁜 􀀤􀁑􀁑􀁘􀁄􀁏 􀀵􀁈􀁓􀁒􀁕􀁗 􀀧􀀲􀀰􀀬􀀱􀀬􀀲􀀱 􀀵􀀨􀀶􀀲􀀸􀀵􀀦􀀨􀀶 􀀔􀀜regulated company, our dividend payout ratio shouldmore closely track that of our regulated peer utilities.While all dividend declarations are subject to boardapproval, in light of the 60 to 65 percent payout policyand our earnings growth expectations, you shouldexpect dividend increases to remain consistent with 5to 6 percent earnings growth in 2012 and beyond.We strongly believe that growth in our core regulatedbusinesses fuels the need for a dividend increase— even in a year in which operating earnings per sharecould fall from the previous year. Among the reasons:First, remember that the company views 2011 asan anomaly.We expect commodity prices — and,consequently, New England power prices — to hit abottom. We expect to refuel all three of our merchantnuclear reactors, tie in two cooling towers to two unitsat Brayton, and perform maintenance on turbines atthe gas-fired Fairless Energy facility near Philadelphia,which has operated more than expected because of lownatural gas costs. Second, consistent with the 2006plan to transform Dominion, we are changing theprofile of investment in our company.Dominion believes that rewarding those whoown our company and are a large part of its success isimportant. In sum, our board agrees that increasing thedividend is the right thing to do.􀀷􀀫􀀤􀀱􀀮 􀀼􀀲􀀸In what has been a year of change—and for Dominion,five years of change — your company continuedits transformation into a more regulated company, acompany whose earnings are less tied to the vagariesof the commodity markets and more to constructiveregulatory structures that recognize the need to buildinfrastructure now to meet future demand. We havemet earnings targets and increased the dividend. Wehave sold operations that did not fit what we see aspart of the Dominion of tomorrow.While last year was a great year, 2011 could be atough one. But our employees and shareholders haveconfidence that Dominion will rise to the challenge.During the five years of Dominion’s transformation,we did what we said we would do, and did itwell — thanks in large part to our 16,000 employeesand your confidence in our transformation and growthplan. You have good reason to remain confident inyour company’s direction.In 2011, this new Dominion will build on fiveyears of stable, predictable earnings, a solid dividend,and promises fulfilled. We are poised to grow, and doso holding steadfast to our core values.Sincerely,􀀷􀁋􀁒􀁐􀁄􀁖 􀀩􀀑 􀀩􀁄􀁕􀁕􀁈􀁏􀁏 􀀬􀀬Chairman, President and CEO
