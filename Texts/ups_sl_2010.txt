EMERGING STRONGER
“We experienced balanced growth across all business segments and achieved record profit levels in International Package and Supply Chain and Freight.”
 
During the year, UPS implemented a major restructuring plan for its U.S. operations and completed several ambitious in- frastructure projects. We continued to expand into emerging international markets as well as introduce industry leading products to customers around the world.
The tremendous financial performance that UPS realized during 2010 was a direct result of tough decisions made during the recession and the superb execution by the UPS team. We experienced balanced growth across all business segments and achieved record profit levels in International Package and Supply Chain and Freight.
Looking back, I am proud of our many accomplishments. Here are some of the highlights from 2010:
Creating Value
Advancements in our industry-leading technology allowed us to introduce new products and services in 2010 that simplified and improved customers’ business processes.
• To help our customers better manage returns in the United
States, we now offer UPS Returns® Flexible Access, a low cost and high quality service that provides unmatched alternatives to customers.
• We introduced UPS Smart Pickup®, a service that saves money by eliminating scheduled stops that are unneces- sary and routes unscheduled ones to the nearest driver.
• In April, we released the first-to-market mobile applica- tion for Google® AndroidTM smart phones, adding to our comprehensive suite of applications for mobile devices.
• For our International customers, we introduced UPS Import ControlSM, a solution that allows them to better manage inbound shipments.
• We continue to develop new innovative service offerings in the Ocean Freight market, and in 2010,
we introduced UPS Preferred® LCL Ocean Freight. This service offers less-than-container load Ocean Freight customers improved shipment visibility and day-definite delivery commitments up to 20 percent faster than traditional services.
Transforming to Compete
In 2010, small package operations in the United States were transformed to serve our customers more effectively and ensure our future success. Now organized along strategic market lines—with resources closer to customers—we are focused on what is necessary to compete and win.
Technology continues to transform our superior global network. For example, Telematics software has been implemented in approximately one third of our U.S. package car fleet. This technology not only increases productivity and reduces cost, but it also improves safety.
Investing to Grow
In 2010, UPS completed significant infrastructure projects that have strategically enhanced our global network. And, we invested in technology that has further improved operational efficiency.
• We completed the expansion of Worldport®, our global air hub, ahead of schedule and under budget. This creates substantial network operational improvements and allows UPS to fly larger, more fuel-efficient aircraft.
• We began operating our new intra-Asia air hub in Shenzhen, China, allowing us to better serve our customers by reducing time in transit for hundreds of city pairs in the region.
We also developed strategic alliances in Asia to further strengthen the reach of our global network and expand our service offerings.
UPS 2010 ANNUAL REPORT 03
 After more than two years of economic turmoil we saw signs of recovery in 2010. Emerging from the recession as a stronger and more responsive organization, UPS was uniquely positioned to benefit from the improving business conditions. The result was a 9.4 percent increase in revenue to $49.5 billion and adjusted* diluted earnings per share soaring 54 percent. Our business strategy was driven by three tenets: creating value for customers, transforming our business, and investing for growth.

 • New relationships were established with local partners in the key emerging markets of Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. These alliances allow us to expand the coverage of our global network.
• We submitted an application for a domestic service li- cense in China. This is the next logical step in our strategy for expansion in the Chinese marketplace.
These investments will enhance the service we give customers, provide better access to international markets, and improve efficiencies in the UPS network.
Recognition
Throughout the year, UPS was recognized for leadership in a variety of areas.
• UPS was named “most admired” in its industry by
Fortune and one of the Top 10 most reputable companies
by Forbes magazines.
• United Way recognized UPS and its employees as
the first company ever to total donations of more than
$1 billion.
• We were honored when President Obama asked UPS
to serve on his Export Council, working with the administration and business leaders to help achieve the objective of doubling U.S. exports in the next five years.
• Our efforts in sustainability were recognized by numerous organizations in 2010, including the Climate Innovation Index, the Climate Counts Scorecard, and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.
Other Significant Events
• Last fall, UPS announced a new global communications platform. Given the complexities of today’s marketplace, we designed our advertising campaign to spotlight the power of logistics. Our experience and worldwide capa- bilities make UPS uniquely qualified to provide solutions to customers throughout their supply chains.
• In 2010, we opened our first Olympic Logistics Center
in London. As the Official Logistics and Express Delivery Supporter of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, UPS has an excellent opportunity to showcase its capabilities to the world.
Operations Review
Global Package Operations
Improving economies around the world and market gains led to total package volume growth of 3.4 percent to 3.94 billion packages.
• In the United States, we experienced slow but steady
improvement as customers rebuilt and efficiently managed their inventories. Strong pricing and effective management of our network drove a 45 percent increase in adjusted* operating profit.
• The strength of our International operating model was evident as the average daily volume in that segment jumped 14 percent over last year. Operating profits climbed 39 percent to $1.9 billion, a new record.
During the year, U.S. and International operations showed re- markable adaptability in the face of a challenging economic environment. In the first quarter of the year, we announced a significant restructuring of our U.S. operations. These changes will improve operational efficiency and allow us to better serve our customers with our go-to-market strategy.
The International segment showed the strength of our bal- anced global network and portfolio. We experienced strong growth in all regions of the world in 2010. In Europe, we saw impressive growth throughout the year despite the difficult economic environment.
Supply Chain and Freight
The Supply Chain and Freight segment saw revenue soar 16.5 percent, with total adjusted* operating profit in this segment up 95 percent to $577 million, a new UPS record. This developing segment experienced an improvement in adjusted* operating margin to 6.7 percent in 2010, a 270 basis point jump over last year.
The freight forwarding business unit rebounded in 2010 as a result of improved market conditions and increased demand. Revenue management initiatives and more competitive block-space agreements were key contributors to the success of the unit.
Logistics saw solid gains as we managed supply chains for an increasing number of customers. UPS continued to expand third-party logistics services in the high tech and healthcare industries.

UPS Freight experienced increases in tonnage and ship- ments during the year, which allowed this unit to return to profitability in 2010.
Financial Strength
UPS is proud of its strong balance sheet and ability to gener- ate superior free cash flow. In 2010, we made a decision to take advantage of the record low interest rates available and issued $2 billion in debt. The proceeds from this transaction were used to make discretionary contributions to our pen- sion plans. This transaction was balance sheet neutral and a great move for UPS employees and shareowners.
Our Community
It would have been easy to respond during the recession with a heavy hand aimed solely at cutting costs and jobs. Instead, UPS was prudent and conscious of the responsibili- ties that we have to our more than 400,000 employees, the thousands of communities in which we operate, the customers we serve, and the shareowners who invest in us.
Our decision-making was led by principles that have served us well for 103 years: a balance of economic prosperity, social responsibility, and environmental stewardship.
For example, in 2010 The UPS Foundation invested more than $95 million in charitable giving around the world, continuing to place great emphasis on helping global relief organizations improve their disaster response through more efficient logistics. UPS employees also donated 1.5 million hours of volunteer time.
Our strategy during the economic recovery remains the same: focus on our customers and employees, grow the business while remaining competitive, and operating responsibly.
Outlook for 2011
I remain optimistic about the global economy in 2011 but expect to see economic expansion develop faster in certain regions than others, with UPS ready to take advantage.
Our extensive global network and unique product portfolio provide UPS customers with the unmatched solutions for growing their businesses.
In 2011, UPS expects to implement a more aggressive share repurchase strategy, increasing to approximately
$2 billion. We will continue to invest in opportunities for growth and plan to increase our capital expenditures to $2.2 billion. In January 2011, we used cash to make an additional $1.2 billion in accelerated pension contributions. As a result, our plans are more than 100 percent funded. And in February, we announced an 11 percent increase in our dividend from $0.47 to $0.52 per share.
I look forward to another strong year of earnings growth in 2011. As a result, UPS is expected to surpass previous highs for earnings per share. The company anticipates 2011 diluted earnings per share to increase between 16 and 22 percent over 2010 adjusted* diluted earnings per share to a range of $4.12 to $4.35.
Stronger Than Ever
It was hard to imagine in the midst of the “great recession” in 2009 that we would be anticipating record earnings per share in just two short years. I am proud to say that UPS has emerged from the recession as a much stronger company. With the best financial and competitive position in the industry, we are a company with a rock-solid balance sheet, strong earnings growth, and tremendous free cash flow.
Yes, 2010 was a great year for UPS, and I am confident that 2011 will be even better, as we further implement the three tenets of our strategy. We will continue to create value
for our customers, transform to strengthen our leadership position, and invest in key markets and new opportunities.
