                 From Our Unconventional Perspective
EOG had another record-setting year in 2014. We rewarded shareholders with strong growth and returns that set us apart from others in the industry. Driven by a consistent, returns- focused strategy while constantly refining our proprietary drilling and completion technology and processes, EOG achieved record net income of $2,915 million compared to $2,197 million in 2013. Our game-changing tight crude oil plays — the South Texas Eagle Ford Shale, North Dakota Bakken and West Texas/New Mexico Delaware Basin — enabled EOG to extend our lead as the largest crude oil producer in the Lower 48 States.
Looking at 2015, EOG’s long-time emphasis on returns remains constant. In fact, we expect to be one of the
few companies in the industry to earn healthy returns; yet we have no plans to expand EOG’s production in a low- price environment simply for the sake of growth.
In 2015, we intend to drill fewer, but better wells. At the same time, we plan to hold back on some of our completions and build an inventory of uncompleted wells that will remain until crude oil prices show a marked improvement. When the rebound occurs, and we are confident it will, EOG is primed and ready to resume robust production growth.
EOG has the flexibility to pursue this unconventional strategy because
we continue to manage our greatest resources — assets, technology and people — for superb performance and long-term growth.

                EOG Finds the Best Assets
Discovering and locking in the best acreage when leasing costs are low provides EOG with a potent strategic edge as we grow our portfolio of top- ranked crude oil assets. Using this early-mover advantage in 2014, our explorationists added five new plays — four in the DJ and Powder River Basins in the Rockies and one in the Permian Basin — to a group that already includes some of the best rock in the business.
Not only do we have great assets, but we also have a proven ability to develop them successfully. Because EOG has grown organically by drilling premier plays for years, we have
the added advantages of scale and experience. In fact, we have the most horizontal resource play experience of any oil and gas company — major
or independent — and we’re putting it to good use by
identifying new plays, lowering costs and improving well
productivity.
Last year, we expanded EOG’s inventory by adding more than twice as many locations as we drilled,
and we have been able to grow our reserves significantly. For example, EOG increased the reserve(1) potential in the Eagle Ford to 3.2 BnBoe in 2014. Between the Eagle Ford and the new Rockies plays, we added
1.4 BnBoe of potential reserves(1) to EOG’s asset base last year.
EOG is Technology-Driven
At EOG, the quest for performance improvement and innovation never stops. We focus on science and technology to internally create proprietary techniques that make
us better. Our decentralized organizational structure, which places EOG employees near the assets they manage, allows each play to serve
as a mini-laboratory. Within close- knit regional teams, geoscientists and engineers experiment with new ideas and quickly share results with their counterparts to replicate in other parts of the company.
This approach has led to advances
in both drilling and completion
design that have propelled EOG to the forefront of the industry. It also explains why our wells perform
better and better, year after year. Our distinctive methodologies, particularly with the completion process, are difficult for those outside of EOG
to reproduce.
Notably, EOG innovation is not limited to completions. Last year, technology gains aided EOG in cutting the average number of drilling days per well and driving down costs across our major plays. In addition, we improved productivity by honing our ability to more precisely place well laterals within their targeted zones, while developing and testing tighter spacing patterns.
EOG Has the Right People
EOG’s employees share what we characterize as an “entrepreneurial mindset.” We are always asking, “What if?” We use the feedback to fine-tune everything we do – from the development of our outstanding crude oil assets to our commitment to safety and environmental stewardship.
Working together, our 3,000 employees have made great strides toward our mission of being the
best independent exploration and production company. In our corporate culture, we are not satisfied unless we are continuing to improve.

 In Conclusion
EOG’s consistent strategy has fostered compelling results year after year. In 2014, EOG demonstrated
its capital efficiency by achieving ROE(2) of 16 percent and ROCE(2) of 14 percent. In addition, EOG increased the dividend twice, the 15th and 16th raises in 15 years. These decisions were tied directly to EOG’s excellent financial and operational performance. The board of directors also approved a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend.
In 2015, EOG is focused on evaluating promising new plays and expanding existing ones as we continue to pursue long-term growth prospects. We want to see our big fields keep getting bigger and our deep drilling inventory grow in size and quality.
Given EOG’s strong balance sheet, this year’s crude oil price environment is offering a unique opening to add lower-cost, high-quality acreage through new leaseholds, farm-in agreements and tactical acquisitions. We plan to rigorously evaluate and pursue these opportunities as we simultaneously continue to advance our premier assets.
To that end, EOG remains laser focused on technical progress and cost reduction. Already this year, we see service cost decreases and are confident we can achieve additional cost improvement through ongoing efficiency gains.
EOG and its experienced management team have successfully navigated through weak crude oil price cycles before, and we are well positioned
to weather this storm. We expect to come out of the current downturn stronger than ever before. When the time is right, EOG is poised to move swiftly. In the meantime, we will focus on rates of return, maintain capital discipline and manage EOG for sustained, long-term growth.
