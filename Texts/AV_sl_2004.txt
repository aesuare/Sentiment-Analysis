Chairman's Letter

211 Mt. Airy Road Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920 Donald K. Peterson Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer January 4, 2005 Dear Shareholder: Fiscal 2004 was a period marked by a number of significant, positive developments for Avaya, all of which reinforced the strength of our vision, the importance of our strategic advantages in the marketplace, the commitment of our employees around the world, and our ability to build value for shareholders. Nowhere is the substantial progress we have made more readily apparent than in the improvements we have made in our financial strength and profitability. We significantly strengthened our balance sheet by increasing cash and reducing debt, while increasing operating cash flow by $310 million and operating income by $260 million, and posting our first annual profit since becoming an independent company four years ago. During fiscal 2004, we also enhanced our leadership position in the enterprise telephony market, gaining increased market share and mind share. The principal driver of growth in this market--the transition by enterprises to IP telephony--gained momentum as we moved through the year. Customers are increasingly looking to realize the benefits that IP telephony solutions offer to improve productivity and enhance revenues. We believe we are well positioned to benefit from this growing demand due to our strategic differentiation in the marketplace. To further strengthen our position in our core market, we made a number of important strategic moves during the year that sharpen our focus, enhance our product/service portfolio and extend our footprint. The success we enjoyed throughout fiscal 2004 was the direct result of the hard work of our employees since we became an independent company. During the past four years, through the industry's ups and downs, we never lost focus on delivering on our commitment to shareholders. We have built a strong foundation for success and now are beginning to see evidence of this success. We have come a long way in a relatively short period of time, and believe our future is filled with promise and opportunity. In fiscal year 2004, we grew revenues, captured the operating leverage in our business model, substantially improved operating income, and significantly strengthened our balance sheet. Revenues overall grew by $273 million for the year, and we continued to keep a tight lid on our expenses. This financial discipline, which is now firmly entrenched in our culture, will help enable us to continue to drive profitable growth. Our operating cash flow was $479 million and operating income was $323 million. Importantly, all three business segments were profitable for the year. We ended the year with a strong cash position of $1.6 billion, up from $1.2 billion in fiscal 2003. We successfully worked to de-leverage the balance sheet and reduced total debt by 37.8%. This included retiring $356 million in senior secured notes. We have taken further steps in 2005 to reduce debt by retiring most of the remaining senior secured notes and by redeeming our convertible securities. Increased enterprise spending on IP telephony helped drive our revenue growth, as the technology transition by customers gained traction during the year. Fiscal 2004 marked an inflection point for enterprises of all sizes in their migration to IP telephony. What is driving this transition? While the initial focal point for enterprises was cost reduction, we believe that customers today are more attracted to the productivity improvements and transformative benefits IP telephony offers their business operations.

Chairman's Letter

When we look at Avaya's product sales during the course of fiscal 2004, we see ample evidence that enterprises are making the technology transition to IP telephony, particularly in the U.S. market. This is demonstrated by the accelerating product sales growth we generated during fiscal 2004, and specifically by the double digit quarter over quarter growth in product sales during the second half of the year. As of today's date, more than 2800 of our customers have over 1000 lines of IP telephony deployed, and we've shipped 35,000 IP Office systems, our small and medium business systems solutions. Sales of servers, software and gateways showed robust growth, and the increase in IP line shipments continues to more than offset the decrease in TDM line shipments. Today, Avaya is one of the leaders in enterprise telephony revenue and IP telephony ports shipped, and we will continue to capture the growth opportunities presented by the IP telephony market, both domestically and internationally. Underlying this momentum is Avaya's strategic differentiation in the marketplace. We are the only company in our market that is exclusively focused on the enterprise. Our significant voice expertise, our large installed customer base, a comprehensive suite of applications, and an end-to-end portfolio of services offerings set us apart from our competitors. These advantages enable us to give customers a real choice when they decide to migrate to IP telephony. We stay focused on our customers' return on investment and work very hard to provide IP telephony solutions tailored to their specific needs--now and in the future. That means working with open platforms, and helping customers evolve their existing networks at their own pace and on their own terms. Our Global Services business continues to enhance our strong position in the market as a major IP telephony supplier with a full portfolio of products and services offerings. Looking ahead, we believe there is a real opportunity to grow our Services business as the technology transition to IP telephony accelerates. Enterprise customers will need deeper partnerships as they determine the best ways to integrate IP telephony solutions into their operations. Avaya's professional services capabilities in the planning, design, implementation and management of IP solutions will continue to set us apart and provide added value to our customers. Security, remote monitoring and diagnostics are additional key offerings provided by Avaya Global Services. On the maintenance side, we have added tele-web marketing capabilities to help our customers reach us for support and services. This new capability will not only make it easier for customers to do business with us, it will also help lower costs for both Avaya and our customers. Throughout the year, we enhanced and introduced new products, and announced strategic alliances to help our customers use IP Telephony to improve their business processes. Early in the year, we launched a portfolio of products that includes a new generation of market-leading software applications, media servers and gateways for small, medium and large enterprises, and a full range of desktop and wireless IP telephones. We also integrated Session Initiation Protocol--an industry standard that enables users to conduct multimedia communications sessions--into our portfolio of IP-based Avaya MultiVantageTM Communications Applications. Our new converged mobility products extend IP telephony to wireless networks and deliver the benefits of desktop communications to employees wherever they are in a building. We additionally launched Avaya Contact Center Express, our first complete multimedia contact center solution designed solely for medium sized businesses. We have also entered into a number of partnerships and alliances geared toward helping us deliver the IP products and services that enterprises need to save time and money, improve efficiency and more effectively conduct their business. These include a collaboration with Polycomt, Inc. to develop and market new IPtelephony-enabled video solutions and for Avaya to sell and service Polycom products globally. In early 2005, we expect to launch new products from our collaboration with Motorola Inc. and Proxim Corporation, product offerings that enable seamless mobility between cell phone systems and wireless LANs. For enterprises using the system, cell phones would have all of the functionality of--and could actually replace--traditional office phones.

Avaya announced a multiyear, multimillion-dollar strategic alliance with Extreme Networks Inc. to jointly develop and market converged communications solutions. Avaya will also resell Extreme's data networking products and provide comprehensive planning, design, implementation and management services support through our Global Services area. We have also expanded our alliance with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) to jointly deliver speech-enabled self-service solutions that allow easier and more costeffective deployment of customized speech applications throughout a business. We are focused on building a company with the size and scale to compete in global markets. During fiscal 2004, we made key acquisitions and divestitures to help bolster our competitive position both domestically and internationally. In early fiscal 2004, we sold our Connectivity Solutions business to sharpen our focus on faster growing market segments. We purchased substantially all of the assets of Expanets, Inc. to add strength in the small and medium business markets. To enhance our services offerings around design, implementation and management of converged networks, we purchased the professional and managed services businesses of, and service delivery technology assets from, Vista Information Technologies Inc. Later in the year we increased our ownership interest in Tata Telecom Ltd., a leading distributor of Avaya products in India. Avaya now owns a majority interest in that company, which has been renamed Avaya GlobalConnect Ltd. Our acquisition of Spectel plc, a world leader in audio and web conferencing solutions, closed in early fiscal 2005 and adds an important dimension to our conferencing applications. Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, we announced the completion of the acquisition of Tenovis GmbH & Co. KG, a major European provider of enterprise communications systems and services. Tenovis will greatly enhance Avaya's size and scale in Europe, and represents a major step in our plan to grow our business globally. Our companies have complementary businesses and strategies, which makes Tenovis an excellent strategic and operational fit. Based on industry analyst reports, the addition of Tenovis makes us #3 in market share in Europe measured in lines shipped. Our leading-edge portfolio of systems and applications, and Tenovis's extensive customer base and sales/service infrastructure, form a powerful combination and a strong platform for Avaya's growth in Europe. With this transaction, we gain the opportunity to generate a higher level of product sales to Tenovis's installed base, to expand relationships with multinational customers operating on both continents, and to win new customers in Europe. Finally, the Tenovis acquisition positions us extremely well to capitalize on the acceleration in IP-PBX adoption that is expected in Europe. Looking Ahead As we move into fiscal 2005, it's clear that we have built a strong foundation for our future growth and success. We've improved our operations and created a business model geared for profitable growth. We've enhanced our product and service offerings, strengthened our competitive positioning and reinforced our strategic advantages. Perhaps most importantly, we have instilled in our company a deep commitment to delivering on our strategic goals and objectives. It's also clear, from the actions we have taken so far in 2005, that we are approaching the new year with the same focus and energy that we have brought to our company since we became independent four years ago. Our recent steps to further reduce debt and the acquisitions of Tenovis and Spectel improve our financial strength and competitive positioning. The success we are enjoying is a direct result of the important contributions made by our employees. Everyone at Avaya has contributed to our success, and I want to thank our employees, our management team and our Board of Directors for their hard work. I would also like to thank you, our shareholders, for your support of our efforts. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through 2005. Sincerely, Donald K. Peterson Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer I-3
