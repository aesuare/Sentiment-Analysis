TO O U R SHAREHOLDERS:
2001: HARD QUESTIONS FOR HARD TIMES When business historians talk about 2001, they will highlight fallout from two dramatic collapses, that of the twin towers in New York City on September 11 and that of giant energy trader Enron. These events raised serious questions about the physical and financial security of American citizens. · Can our government protect us from harm? · Are adequate resources available to effect recovery from huge disasters? · Do corporate accounting policies and standards adequately protect investors? All of these are tough questions with far-reaching, long-range implications for our nation and for our insurance industry. They deserve the urgent attention of political and business leaders. As citizens and as insurance professionals, we support a proactive approach to homeland security and serious consideration of proposals for a federally backed insurance facility to absorb the financial shock of an act of terror.

When Chairman and CEO Jack Schiff, Jr. addressed a gathering of Company associates outside CFC Headquarters on a bright November afternoon, everyone's thoughts were on another day and with others whose workplaces and homes would never be the same after September 11. Associates responded to the great sadness that swept over not just New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, D.C., but all of America's Main Streets. They felt the same urge to act that they would feel if a next-door neighbor suffered a grievous loss. So while management worked to determine and fulfill insurance obligations arising out of September 11 events, associates contributed personally and raised funds to support heroic rescuers and their lifesaving companions. On November 21, Jack thanked associates for establishing a $55,000 fund to aid in the training of search and rescue dogs and their handlers. "The Company benefits from having staff and agents who value personal involvement and relationships," Jack said. "In the Main Street markets we serve, people are more comfortable doing business with someone they know, someone who cares. That means someone who takes the extra time to customize their insurance program; someone who makes the extra effort to keep policies and coverages up to date; someone who knows that when they have a claim, their loss may be more than financial. From our file rooms and administrative areas to our underwriting and field departments, associates keep Cincinnati's performance personal." 4

More immediately, the year's high-profile collapses were less dramatic in their direct effects on the performance of Cincinnati Financial Corporation. As an insurer with a Main Street focus and regional distribution outside of the largest population centers, your Company was not as exposed to such losses as some insurers. At $9 million ­ mostly for assumed reinsurance ­ the Company's losses from September 11 events were small compared with an April hailstorm that caused $47 million of insured losses for our policyholders, with an impact of $19 million after reinsurance and taxes. As for the second collapse, your Company wrote no insurance or surety bonds for Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest firm. Our investment portfolio held securities issued by Enron and Kmart, another firm going through a high-profile bankruptcy. Combined, these issues were just $18 million ­ less than two-tenths of 1 percent ­ of the portfolio. After sales and write downs, these holdings retained $1 million of book value. The $11.571 billion investment portfolio comprises 82.9 percent of your Company's assets, which reached an all-time high of $13.959 billion at year-end 2001. Book value, which also reflects the strength of our investment portfolio, was $37.07 at year-end 2001, slightly below the year-ago level of $37.26. Net income rose 34.4 percent in 2001 to $193 million, or $1.19 per share, after net capital losses of $17 million. In 2000, net income was $144 million, or 89 cents per

share, on a comparable basis excluding that year's one-time charge of $25 million, or 16 cents per share, for impaired technology assets. Net operating income rose 44.1 percent to $210 million, or $1.29 per share, in 2001 versus $146 million, or 90 cents per share, on the comparable basis in 2000. Revenues advanced 9.9 percent to a record $2.561 billion in 2001. This year's higher earnings were driven by investment income, which continued to benefit from steadily increasing dividends on common stocks in the portfolio, and by improved insurance underwriting, which benefited from firmer pricing in the commercial insurance marketplace. From your Company's perspective as a regional insurer with a Main Street focus, the changing price environment is the big story of 2001 and 2002. After 13 years of soft prices in a buyer's market, industry underwriting losses have been mounting and industry surplus declining. This pressure has forced insurers, your Company included, to become more selective about the business written and more diligent in pricing it in line with the risk accepted. The turn to a seller's marketplace was already in motion prior to September 11, and some observers think that turn could come faster and last longer after the financial shocks associated with last year's collapses. Now here are some more tough questions, ones that we have to answer ourselves. · Can The Cincinnati Insurance Companies control loss severity and still maintain a stable market for the local independent agents we serve?

· Can those agents continue to rely on Cincinnati to be a market for 60 percent to 70 percent of the risks encountered by a typical agency in our operating territory? · If our actions in this marketplace lead to top-line growth of premium revenues, can we turn this growth into bottom-line earnings? 2001: HARD WORKERS MEET A HARDENING MARKET Over the years, Cincinnati has been tagged as a company that thrives in a strong market for insurance ­ a hard market in the industry's vernacular. We think that's true, and we'll be all right. Many positives are on our side. First and foremost, we do know how to underwrite, and for us that's an activity that happens both in the field and at headquarters. Over the past two years, we became more aggressive about cleaning up the book of business and in 2001 improved results for some lines, notably commercial and personal auto. Agents, field representatives and underwriters are teaming up to gather facts and closely evaluate new and renewal risks. They aren't afraid of the work that leads to sound risk selection, appropriate policy terms and conditions and accurate pricing for the risk exposure. They recognize that local knowledge and local decisionmaking are advantages we can leverage to stay a market for good accounts in most classes of business. Second, your Company has the financial strength to pick up the pace as opportunities arise. Our written premiums-to-surplus

ratio is 1.0, indicating a good margin for growth. The industry's written premiums are 1.2 times surplus, weakened from 0.9 times surplus in 2000. Strong growth of earned premiums softened 2001 loss severity, and our capacity to write more good business will be a factor in offsetting continued severity due to inflated costs and judgments. Your Company's cash flow historically has been sufficient to fund claim payments and fuel investments ­ the key to bottomline profits. We make accounting policies and reserving decisions with the intention of giving a conservative, true picture of your Company's position. We feel strongly that our financial reporting should reflect not just the letter, but the spirit, of accounting policies and standards. When material bad news is on the horizon ­ such as the problems with the uninsured motorist line in 2000 ­ our strategy has been to deal with it openly and then move on. Faced with rising severity of losses, we opted to provide our constituents with more information, not less, shedding light on the issues and the solutions we pursued. Third, your Company has longstanding relationships with highly-rated reinsurers. Our capacity and willingness to retain more risk in 2002 will help mitigate the very large premium increases these reinsurers need to protect their own financial health. Both our catastrophe reinsurance program and the reinsurance working treaties we use to structure layers of coverage for large risks include terrorism coverage, with limitations.

The momentum of premium coming into Cincinnati's insurance companies drove the pace in the Investment Department. Cash flow available for investment during 2001 was superb ­ one of the best years ever without a debt offering. Portfolio managers invested $359 million of net new cash, allocating 77.5 percent of new money to fixed income investments and 22.5 percent to equities. Historically, on a cost basis, fixed income has been 65 percent and common stock 35 percent of the portfolio. As market values change over time, this allocation reverses, resulting in a portfolio that has approximately 75 percent of market value in equities. The Company's total-return equity orientation is reflected in high unrealized gains as stocks are held to appreciate over the long term while they pay steadily increasing dividends. At December 31, 2001, the equity portfolio contained $6.321 billion of unrealized gains, 95.9 percent of this in the 10 largest of the Company's 44 stock holdings. Annualized dividend income from these stocks is approximately $172 million, up $18 million from 2001 increases, as 26 of the 44 stocks in the portfolio raised their dividends. Our largest holding ­ Fifth Third Bancorp ­ raised its dividend twice during the year for a total annualized addition to income of $15 million. While the Company's concentrated investment in a small group of high-quality, dividend-paying financial and value stocks is unconventional for an insurer, the strategy has proven successful. In a declining interest-rate environment, financial stocks have tended to maintain their value better than others. In 2001, the equity portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 Index for the fourth time in six years, with a 2001 rate of return of 0.7 percent versus the S&P 500's 11.9 percent decline.

Approximately $71.00 in investments supported each Cincinnati Financial common share at yearend 2001. Portfolio managers favor stocks with above-average market yields and convertible and investment-grade bonds with compelling riskreward profiles.

While the Company's high percentage of common stock investments reduces the portfolio's effective yield relative to other insurers, it also contributes to the long-term growth of surplus.

CinFin's strategy mirrors that of the parent company ­ equity-based portfolios centering on best-in-class companies. In its third full year of operations, the Company's asset management services subsidiary ended the year with $663 million under management, up 23.6 percent from the year-ago total.

A.M. Best Company affirmed the A++ Superior rating of Cincinnati's property casualty companies based on superior capitalization, strong regional franchise, modest financial leverage and excellent cash flow. Fewer than 3 percent of insurer groups qualify at this level. Best affirmed Cincinnati Life's A+ Superior rating and awarded a new aa Very Strong debt rating to Cincinnati Financial's senior debentures. Standard & Poor's currently rates the corporate debentures A+ Strong and our insurance companies at AA- Very Strong, citing a strong market position afforded by an extremely loyal and productive agency force, a low-cost infrastructure, extremely strong capitalization and strong financial flexibility. While S&P lowered its ratings in January 2001 after our announcement of a $110 million reserve addition in the fourth quarter of 2000, Cincinnati retains top-tier S&P Security Circle ratings. Moody's Investors Service maintained the A2 rating on the corporate debentures and the Aa3 rating of the property casualty companies, noting a strong regional agency franchise, large capital base and historic operating profitability.

RANKINGS
(published in 2001 and generally based on 2000 performance) Fortune (April 16, 2001): Among the Fortune 1,000 U.S. industrial and service corporations, Cincinnati Financial was the 17th largest U.S. stock property casualty insurer based on revenues, placing sixth in that industry category for 10-year total return to investors. Forbes (April 16, 2001): Among the top 500, Cincinnati Financial ranked 237th for assets and 352nd for market value. Compared with all companies appearing on any of the Forbes 500 lists for market value, sales, profits or assets, Cincinnati Financial scored 391st. Best's Review (July 2001): Cincinnati ranked 32nd among property casualty groups based on net premiums written. Among the top 200 life health insurers, Cincinnati Life ranked 164th. Business Insurance (August 20, 2001): Cincinnati was one of only eight companies named to both the property casualty and life health Ward's 50 Benchmark Groups. Qualifying insurers have outstanding five-year scores for financial safety, consistency and performance. Cincinnati Insurance stood among just 10 companies named to the Ward's 50 for 11 consecutive years. 8

For new risks with more than $50 million of total insured values, the Company is purchasing facultative reinsurance in excess of our retention. Our reinsurers are "grandfathering" in terrorism coverage until the policy's anniversary or renewal. Risks with lower insured values have terrorism coverage under the working treaty. Named the leading commercial package insurer in survey results published by Crittenden's Property Casualty Rates & Ratings newsletter (July 2001), Cincinnati writes approximately 80 percent to 85 percent of our commercial policies at annual premiums below $10,000. With reinsurance and terrorism coverage in place, we will have the flexibility to safely write the Main Street risks that are our primary appetite and to selectively write larger risks when our agents and their clients have special needs. Finally, we have built the infrastructure to accept and service more good business. Our talented associates and loyal agents are primed to do what has to be done and to do it better than ever. Staffing has increased 13 percent since the beginning of 2000, and training programs have greatly expanded for both Company and agency staff. The Company is developing and introducing technology to streamline back-office functions. The year 2001 brought the debut of CinciLink, an agency extranet that is the delivery platform for new and updated software including CinciPrint, which gives agents the convenience of retrieving and completing forms online.

Imaging technology currently in use for selected business will be applied in additional areas during 2002, and agents in a pilot state will begin using an online personal policy processing system with functionality supporting a direct-bill option. 2002: HOLDING HARD COURSE All of these considerations give us optimism for 2002. Barring unusual catastrophes, our target is to return by year-end to a statutory combined ratio of 101.3 percent, which was our average ratio from 1995 to 1999. Our will to underwrite and the improved pricing environment should help us build on the positive trends of 2001, when the ratio improved to 103.6 percent compared with 109.9 percent in 2000. Ultimately, we won't be satisfied until we achieve breakeven underwriting that makes it possible for all investment income to flow to earnings. Cincinnati Financial returned more than $182 million to shareholders in 2001, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases of more than 1 million shares at an average price of $37.67. Over the past 10 years, cash dividends paid per share rose to 82 cents from 27 cents, adjusted for stock dividends and splits. That's a 10.2 percent compound growth rate for the 10-year period. Further, the Board declared a 6 percent increase in the dividend during the first quarter of 2002, raising the indicated annual dividend to 89 cents per share. At 2.3 percent, the current dividend yield

TO THE

compares favorably with a yield of 1.4 percent for the S&P 500 Index. The vote to continue the trend of increasing dividends reflects the Board's confidence in our financial strength, business strategy, associates and agents. The 2001 Mergent's (formerly Moody's) Handbook of Dividend Achievers ranked Cincinnati Financial 15th for the longest record of dividend growth, with 40 consecutive years (now 41) of annual cash dividend increases. And on December 31, 2001, Cincinnati Financial was an entrée on BusinessWeek's "Menu of Investment Opportunities" as a stock with a high S&P Equity Ranking and low price-to-book value. While there are many schools of thought about investment valuation, steadily increasing dividends and stable book value are two historically attractive features of your Company. As we work to preserve and expand shareholder value, our plan is to build on strengths instead of shift directions. Our Main Street focus, hard-working people, selective and conservative approach and commitment to personal service and relationships are proven strategies through all kinds of business and economic cycles.
