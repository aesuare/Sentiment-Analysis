Dear Fellow
Investors:

 

LAST YEAR I told you that, as we worked to transform IBM and return it fully to industry leadership, we had four clear priorities:
•	to be profitable;
•	to become more competitive;
•	to increase shareholder value;
•	to grow.
We have a lot of work ahead on many fronts - growth, speed to market and re­ engineering, to name three. We're  not the industry leader yet - at least by my definition. Still, I believe we did make significant progress on  our  priorities and that 1994 was the year a new IBM began to emerge.

Starting with profitability. Last year was a solid one financially. We earned $3 billion - our first profitable year since 1990 and, compared with 1993,  a  profit swing of $11 billion.
Last year we also achieved our first year of re enue growth since 1990. Total revenue was $64.1 billion,  up 6 percent after the sale of the Federal Systems Co.
We reduced annual expenses by $3.5 billion, or 15 percent. In the past two years, we reduced expenses a
 
total of $6.3 billion, and we are on course to achieve the additional $1.7 billion toward our total goal of $8 billion no later than mid-1996.
We finished 1994 with more than $10 billion in cash. Our cash flow was exceptionally strong, even after paying out $2.8 billion in restructuring costs. Just as important, we reduced our core  debt - debt in support of operations - by $3.3 billion, to a total of $2.9 billion. Our key report card - market value - reflec ted all

I have spent a good bit of time in our IBM labs, and I can tell you that right now, we see no limit to the pace of change for at least the next decade. And IBM will be a pacesetter. Last year we were No. 1 in the number of U.S. patents issued for the second year in a row, and our 1,298

The information revolution will hap­ pen, but only when the industry stops worshipping technology for its own sake and starts focusing on real value for its customers. We must provide products and services that improve customers' competi­ tive position; that enhance their own cus­ tomer service; that increase their produc­ tivity; that enrich their personal lives.

The second reason I am confident IBM can and will grow is beca use we are focusing on doing the things we have to do in order to grow, and we are making real progress.
Last year , I told you that no company
- in any industry - is going to succee d without a set of tough-mind ed strat egies grounded in a clear understanding of what' s happ ening in the marketplace. I said that, after making IBM profitable, setting such strategies is our single-high­ est priority because they are critical to growth and building shareholder value.

Establish leadership in network-cen­ tric computing: We're moving on many fronts to define  this new market and this
new model of  computing.  We created  the

For more than a year now, we have bee n wor king on a dozen or so business and technology strategies. We' ve made a great deal of progress on some, and on others we've just started. I have grouped these strategies into six "strategic imperatives" - our roadmap for IBM's near-term future. Here's a status report on each of them:
Exploit technology: Getting  technology  out  of  our lab s and into the market place, and doing it quickly, is important to success in a fast-changing industry. New products introduce d in the past 12 to 18 months accounted for almost half our hardware revenues last year. We roll ed out entir ely new generations of key IBM product families: a new class of mainframes, AS/400s, storage devices and networking hardware and software. We' re exp loiting our technology in the indus­ try  throu gh  technology  agreements  with  companies like  Hitachi, Toshiba,  Canon  and  Cyrix.  Our  patent and
 
field testing IBM technologies that deliver interactive
services to consumers and businesses. We' re embracing the Internet and helping customers do the same, pro­ viding encryption technology, anti-virus software and "firewall" security products to support heavy-du ty commercial transactions while protecting vital data from intruders.

Realign the way we deliver value to cus­ tomers: Responding to what our cus­
tomers said they wanted from IBM -
global solution s - we created a single, worldw ide sales and services organiza­ tion, and organized it by i ndustry and technology special ization. Almost every person tn IBM's field  force  today  is aligned by product , serv ice or industry. Our direct  marketing  activities  continue to expand. IBM Dir ect, our largest U.S. telesales operation, grew almost 750 per­ cent in revenue s last year.

employees and reducing work locations, we've eliminated nearly 20 million square feet of office space worldwide. We're doing common-sense things, too, like consolidat­ ing how we purchase goods and serVlces across the company.
Expand market  share in  client / server
computing: We now have 42 Open Systems Centers in 34 countri es, where we help cus­ tomers design and implement client/server applications. Our work with customers in these centers grew more than 50  percent last year, to about the $1 billion revenue mark. We' re focusing on ease of use, sys­ tem s  management  and  software   tools that
 
to  common  technolo gy " building blocks"  across  IBM
hardware units to take advantage of economies of scale and to give custo mers greater interoperability across our systems. Every month, new IBM products and services are being introduc ed with technologies and features contributed from multiple IBM laboratories. We conso l­ id ated more than 100 advertising campaigns adminis­ tered by dozens of agencies, and now have a single voice with one worldwide ad agency. We consolidat ed work done by 89 data centers and now have 58 - saving near­ ly  $1   billion.  By   increa sing our  nu mber  of mobile
 
improve the way products from IBM and other vendors
work together. Independent observers are noting our progress: IBM's VisualAge tool for creating c)je nt/server software was named best application development prod­ uct of 1994 by both Datamation and PC lfeek maga­ zines. And Datamation readers picked etVie w for AlX as systems management product of the year.

Even as we make all these changes, I want to empha­
size just how much of an asset we h ave in our people. IBM people are smart. They are tough and durable and resilient. They are proud of th is company, proud of their own contributions, and their commitment to suc­ cess is rock-solid.
