  To Our Shareholders
 ONE YEAR REMOVED FROM THE WORST RECESSION SINCE
THE GREAT DEPRESSION, SONOCO TURNED IN ONE
OF THE STRONGEST PERFORMANCES IN THE COMPANY’S HISTORY.
Sales reached a record, growing
15%, which was our highest growth
rate in 15 years. Base earnings
improved by 33% and reached the
second best performance in Company
history. Base earnings before interest and taxes
(EBIT) margins grew 100 basis points and
withstood a significant negative price/cost
headwind. And, most importantly, our
shareholders were rewarded with a 19.2% total
return on their investment, including a 28th consecutive
Packaging segment due to lower material costs. In addition to volume and price
increases, sales were higher as a result of acquisitions and open-market sales of corrugating medium previously pro-
duced under a cost-plus-fixed-man- agement-fee arrangement. The impact of the weaker dollar also
contributed to increased sales. Net income attributable to
Sonoco for 2010 was $201.1 million ($1.96 per diluted share), compared with
$151.5 million ($1.50 per diluted share) in 2009. Earnings for 2010 were negatively impacted by an after-tax charge of $31.6 million ($.31 per diluted share) associated with the Company’s debt tender, which was completed in November,
and $16.9 million ($.17 per diluted share) in after-tax asset impairment, restructuring and acquisition charges, partially offset by one-time tax benefits of $10.2 million ($.10 per diluted share). 2009 earnings were negatively impacted by after-tax restructuring charges of $23.0 million ($.23 per diluted share) and a $5.3 million charge ($.05 per diluted share) related to a tax law change in Mexico.
2010 base earnings were $239.4 million ($2.34 per diluted share), compared with $179.8 million ($1.78 per diluted share) in 2009. Significantly higher Companywide volumes, strong productivity, lower pension costs and acquisitions drove the 33% year-over-year improvement. These positive factors were offset by a negative price/cost relationship resulting from higher raw material, energy, freight and other costs, which we were unable to fully recover through higher selling prices. (Information about base earnings and base earnings per diluted share, along with reconciliations to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measures, is provided on pages 19-20 of the Form 10-K contained within this report.)
Overall gross profit margin increased to 18.6% in 2010, compared with 18.5% in 2009. Margins benefited from the impact of increased volume, productivity improvements and lower pension costs. An unfavorable price/cost relationship
partially offset these favorable factors, resulting from our inability to recover higher costs

Summary of 2010 results: optimism returns
Sonoco’s sales achieved a record $4.1 billion in 2010, up 15% from 2009. Volume improvements throughout the Company, most notably in our industrial-focused businesses, accounted for approximately 40% of our year-over-year sales improve- ment. Higher selling prices also
resulted in higher sales, with the
impact realized almost exclusively
in our Tubes and Cores/Paper
segment and principally driven by
higher recovered paper prices.

     Cash generated from operations during 2010 was
$375.1 million, compared with $391.0 million in 2009. Higher earnings in 2010 were offset by an increased use of cash flow tofundworkingcapitalresultingfromsignificantlyhigher levels of business activity, compared to the prior year. Capital expenditures and cash dividends were $145.9 million and $111.8 million, respectively, compared with $104.1 million
and $107.9 million, respectively, in 2009. In addition, the Company used cash to fund acquisitions totaling $138 million and $6 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company also used $23 million in cash in 2010 to repurchase 695,000 shares of common stock, as part of a 2 million share repurchase program that began in December and should conclude in the first quarter of 2011.
At year end, our total debt was $621 million, compared with $581 million at the end of 2009. The Company’s debt- to-total-capital ratio as of December 31, 2010 was 29.2%, compared with 29.6% at the end of 2009, and at the lowest level since 1986.
Our consumer growth
strategy is based on manag-
ing the global expansion of

the world’s largest producer
of composite cans. In addi-
tion, we are expanding our
capabilities and the footprint
of our rigid plastics and flex-
ible packaging businesses
while extending our packaging services offerings into faster- growing emerging markets.
The cornerstone of our strategy has been to position our- selves as the industry’s only “total solutions” provider for con- sumer product companies by offering packaging and supply chain solutions that range from creation to reclamation.

SALES BY OPERATING SEGMENT (Millions of Dollars)
An important part of our total solutions strategy is to provide “one face” of senior account leadership
to coordinate all aspects of our relationships with our largest consumer product customers. This
Over the past decade, Sonoco has been successfully implementing a strategy to change the mix of our business to take advantage of faster-growing consumer-related markets, while reducing some of the cyclicality that we experienced in our more mature industrial-focused businesses.
In 2010, 55% of Sonoco’s sales came from our consumer- focused businesses and 45% from the Company’s industrial businesses. In contrast, a decade ago, when we began to imple- ment this strategy, consumer market sales accounted for only 45% of the Company’s total sales, while our industrial busi- nesses contributed 55%.
For the third consecutive year, our Consumer Packaging segment produced record operating profits of $179.8 million, up 6% from 2009. Consumer Packaging segment sales also reached a record of $1.67 billion, up 8% from 2009.
haveexpandedittoincludeoursevenlargest consumer customers. Combined, these “Corporate Customers” accounted for about $1 billion of our consumer-
related sales in 2010, or about 25% of the Company’s total sales. Furthermore, sales to these customers have grown at a com- pound rate of about 5% in the past five years.
Our Corporate Customer program also was instrumental in Sonoco receiving nearly $200 million in new projects in the last three years, and we expect to double global sales with these strategic accounts in the next five years. Additionally, approximately 60% of our new product sales comes from our Corporate Customers. During 2010, Sonoco produced approximately $165 million in new product sales, including $132 million in consumer-related products. We have a goal of producing $250 million in new consumer-related products in five years by collaborating with our customers and leveraging

our intellectual capabilities. Throughout this report, you will see numerous examples of new rigid paper, rigid plastic and flexible packaging products which were introduced in 2010.
Coming out of the recession, we have seen opportunities for growing sales in private label products. Our private label sales currently account for more than 12% of our total Consumer Packaging segment sales, and we are receiving more opportunities to work with retailers and small private brand companies that want quality packaging in the market- place. (A more detailed review of our growing presence in private label packaging can be found on pages 9-11.)
Our fastest growing packaging operation is our newly branded Sonoco Plastics. During 2010, we centralized our various rigid plastics packaging technologies under a single brand to better explain our diverse plastic packaging offerings,
continues to experience significant global growth. We expect that about half of our Packaging Services segment sales will come from Poland, Mexico and Brazil in 2011. In fact, each of our consumer-related businesses is refining its global expansion plans with a goal of doubling international consumer sales by 2015.
Industrial-related businesses make strong turnaround
2010 was a strong turnaround year for our global industrial- focused businesses. Much of this improvement came in our vertically integrated Tubes and Cores/Paper segment, where sales grew by 23% to $1.65 billion and operating profits gained 80% to $130.2 million. All Other Sonoco, which includes our protective packaging, reels and industrial-related molded plastics businesses, registered a 22% improvement in sales
to $341 million and a 58% gain in operating profits to $41.6 million.
Sales were up in our industrial-related businesses in 2010 due to volume improvements, higher selling prices and favor- able exchange rates. The most significant volume increases occurred in our North American and European tubes and cores operations, which were also the units most significantly impacted by the recession.
Because our industrial businesses are primarily in mature markets in North America and Europe, our strategy is focused on achieving improved returns by being the low-cost producer in our served markets, creating value for our custom- ers and maximizing cash flow by further leveraging our manu- facturing footprint.
Over the past five years, we have reduced our North American industrial manufacturing footprint by more than 15%. As volume returned in 2010, our capacity utilization and margins improved. For instance, our uncoated recycled paper- board mills ran essentially full in 2010, up from a low of 81% in early 2009. EBIT margins in our Tubes and Cores/Paper seg- ment grew from 5.4% in 2009 to 8% in 2010, despite dealing with a significant negative price/cost relationship as we were unable to fully recover a 140% increase in average recovered
emerging markets. We believe this provides us with an opportunity to grow with our customers. For instance, our global Packaging Services business, which includes global contract packaging, point- of-purchase displays and fulfillment,

Outlook: We provide compelling value-creation potential
We believe that our performance in 2010 is proof that Sonoco is back on track and ready to achieve our long-term growth goals. We’re expecting to have another solid year in 2011, with base earnings growing at approximately 10%, a growth rate much like we experienced coming out of the last recession.
Our expected improved performance in 2011 will come from volume growth of between 2% and 4%. New product sales should be about $175 million, as several significant prod- ucts enter the market. Our newly branded Sonoco Plastics operation expects to commercialize approximately $40 million in new business, and our acquisition of APT will add sales of about $60 million in the first half of the year.
Sonoco expects to continue generating strong cash flow from operations, which we will deploy toward creating long-
ing her 16 years of improving leadership development through- out the Company. She was instrumental in Sonoco being rec- ognized for the third consecutive time as one of North America’s 25 Top Companies for Leaders.
As we go into 2011, Sonoco is well-positioned as a global leader in consumer and industrial packaging and packaging services. We have a strong balance sheet and the financial means to implement our value-creating growth strategy.
Thank you for entrusting us with your investment. I’m excited about what we can achieve in the future.

Milliken is one of the largest privately held specialty textiles, carpet and chemicals companies in the world, and an important tubes and cores customer for Sonoco. Milliken is working directly with Sonoco to improve our oper- ating performance.
Through SPS, we are targeting a 3.5% annual improve- ment in manufacturing productivity. In 2010, more than 56% of our $85 million in total productivity savings came from our industrial-focused businesses. We completed the pilot phase
of SPS in our Newport, Tenn., paper mill and two tube and core converting plants in 2010, and the results were dramatic. For instance, at one converting plant, scrap was reduced by 40% from what we thought was the achieved “entitlement” level.
