2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

To Our Shareholders:
In another extraordinarily difficult year for the banking industry, BB&T remained strong and profitable because we stayed true to our deeply rooted vision, mission and values. Your company stood out as a safe and secure haven when other financial institutions stumbled and even failed. Just as BB&T was the only bank in the Carolinas to keep its doors open during the Great Depression of the 1930s, we have been one of three regional banks in the nation to remain profitable during the "Great Recession" of the past two years. We are proud of our accomplishments this year. Among our most important, your company:  ·     ·       ·      Became one of three large regional banks to pass the federal government's "stress test" for capital strength, and among the first group of financial institutions to exit the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. Completed the FDIC-assisted acquisition of Colonial Bank, the largest in our history, in a deal that protects us from Colonial's problem assets while significantly expanding BB&T's presence in Florida, Alabama and Georgia ­ and giving us an important stake in the huge Texas market. Won recognition by our clients for superior service despite the challenging market, as evidenced by independent surveys measuring our mortgage sales and servicing, mobile banking, wealth management, service to small businesses and middle market companies, and more. While these are important achievements, this is no time for complacency. The banking industry, as well as the national and global economies, are not out of the woods yet. We still face risks and challenges. While BB&T has fared better than our peers in the amount of problem assets because of our disciplined lending standards, we must stay vigilant because the real estate markets are still under stress. Our clients are understandably wary of new investment and new loans with so many Americans still out of work and so much uncertainty coming out of Washington. They also are justifiably skeptical after watching so many financial institutions falter or, worse, abuse their trust. As a result, even though we are ready and eager to lend, would-be borrowers are holding back. We also face increased regulation from Washington that will hamper the competitiveness of U.S. banks in a global marketplace. Despite the political rhetoric blaming the banking industry for both causing the financial crisis and now impeding economic recovery, the truth is most traditional U.S. banks have been working very hard to do our primary job ­ lending to help businesses grow and create jobs in the communities they serve. BB&T and other healthy banks have paid back government-assistance funds, with a good return for taxpayers. While some banks did contribute to the crisis by offering risky exotic loans and investments, the government also shares the blame with ill-considered policies encouraging risky unsustainable mortgages. Even though BB&T did not participate in the riskiest subprime mortgages and other investments, and would likely benefit from Washington's push to limit the size and activities of large banks because we avoid esoteric practices such as owning hedge funds, the answer is not to have politicians dictate what products are offered by private financial institutions. The better answer is to require banks to have the capital cushions needed to protect their clients. At BB&T, we want the free market to decide who survives and who fails.

 · Touched the lives of 1.6 million people through the  BB&T Lighthouse Project.  ·      Contributed to the U.S. economy by extending more than $75 billion in loans, including a significant portion to small businesses and middle market companies; restructured $3 billion in mortgage loans to help homeowners keep their homes; and employed more than 32,000 people.

Despite the numerous challenges facing the industry and BB&T, I have never been more optimistic about the long-term future of your company. Unlike many of our competitors, we have the underlying financial strength and profitability to meet our clients' needs as the economy stabilizes and ultimately begins expanding again. We already are benefiting from a "flight to quality" in attracting deposits, purchasing assets and winning clients from weakened and distracted competitors. Revenue from our insurance, mortgage banking and other businesses produced record results in 2009 and we are wellpositioned to expand our corporate banking services. The lighthouse on the cover of this report is a meaningful symbol for BB&T. Since our founding in 1872, we have managed conservatively and been careful stewards of our clients' trust. We have been a beacon guiding clients to safe harbor in turbulent times such as the last two years. In 2009, our Lighthouse Project focused on helping our communities that also are struggling economically; BB&T employees donated 53,000 volunteer hours to more than 1,000 community service projects. In 2010 and beyond, we believe the BB&T lighthouse also will become another kind of beacon ­ one illuminating financial strategies to help our clients meet their financial goals during today's uncertain times, and during the better times ahead. For our country and for BB&T, I firmly believe our best days are ahead.

2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

OUR 2009 RESULTS
Despite a challenging operating environment for financial institutions, BB&T's results showed very positive trends in 2009, including strong growth in deposits and mortgage banking, insurance and other non-interest income. While our bottom-line results reflect continued recessionary pressures, including slower loan growth and higher credit costs, we are encouraged by a significantly slower growth rate in nonperforming assets and more stability in many of our lending portfolios as the year came to a close. We continue to substantially outperform our peers, demonstrate consistent underlying earnings power and are seeing meaningful benefits from our FDIC-assisted acquisition of Colonial Bank. Net income for the year totaled $877 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, reflecting decreases of 42.6% and 57.6%, respectively. In this environment, the most important driver of performance is credit quality. For the second year, increases in the provision for credit losses were the biggest cause for our lower earnings. Nonperforming loans, as a percentage of total loans, were 2.56% at December 31, 2009, compared to 1.43% a year earlier. Net charge-offs increased to 1.74% of average loans and leases for 2009, up from .89% the previous year. Even with these higher levels of nonperforming assets and charge-offs, BB&T still leads our peer group with the lowest levels of nonperforming loans and superior overall credit quality. The largest concentration of our problem loans continues to be residential properties in Atlanta, Florida and metro Washington, D.C., where prices fell sharply from highly inflated levels, as well as modest deterioration in the coastal areas of the Carolinas. We are encouraged by signs of stabilization, particularly in BB&T's consumer loan portfolios. We also are pleased with a reduction in the rate of increase in nonperforming assets for each quarter of 2009. Despite industry concern about problem commercial real estate loans, we have not seen evidence of major deterioration, with a modest increase in gross charge-offs from 1.0% to 1.2% in the fourth quarter. In addition, we are diversifying our loan portfolio to decrease our exposure to real estate while focusing more attention on commercial and industrial loans over the next few years. In the fourth quarter of 2009, our commercial and industrial portfolio increased by 11.5% on an annualized basis, while we continued to work through our homebuilder portfolio, reducing our exposure to this stressed portfolio by $2.2 billion, or 28%, to $5.8 billion, during 2009. The growth in commercial and industrial lending reflects our success in attracting companies that moved their business to BB&T in a "flight to quality" because they view BB&T as better equipped to meet their financing needs. BB&T's strong balance sheet also contributed to our record net revenues in 2009 as depositors sought safety and security. Average client deposits, including balances acquired from Colonial, increased by 28.8% to $105.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to a year earlier; without Colonial, client deposits were up a stillstrong 7.1%. Our deposit growth during the year reflects continued improvement in deposit mix in the fourth quarter, with more of our growth coming in lower-cost deposits. In addition, deposit costs have continued to decrease while balances have continued to grow.

Average loans and leases increased by 7.3% compared to 2008, including loans acquired from Colonial. Excluding Colonial, average loan growth was up 2.6% from 2008. Our loan growth compares very favorably with the industry, where average loan balances are generally down. Banks have been criticized for reluctance to make loans due to concerns about credit quality, but the main reason for sluggish loan growth is soft demand from borrowers still anxious about an uncertain economy. I assure you that BB&T remains eager to make every good loan we can find. Net interest income totaled $4.8 billion for 2009, up 14.3% from a year earlier. Our net interest margin ­ basically the difference between the interest received on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and other funding, expressed as a percentage of average earning assets ­ improved to 3.66% from 3.58% in 2008. Importantly, in the fourth quarter of 2009, our margin improved to 3.80%, the strongest level in years. Revenue from BB&T's fee income-producing businesses, which represent 42.8% of total revenue, increased during 2009 by 23.1% to $3.9 billion, underscoring the benefit of our diversified businesses. The biggest contributor was BB&T's insurance operations, which exceeded $1 billion in noninterest income for the first time, and mortgage

banking operations, which produced a 139% jump in income from record production revenue and increased servicing income from a larger servicing portfolio. Checkcard, wealth management and other non-deposit fees and commissions also contributed to this growth. For 2009, BB&T's return on average assets was .56% while the return on common shareholders' equity was 4.93%. While these ratios are significantly lower than we experience in a "normalized" credit environment, they do reflect positive earnings. An average of our peers' performance reflects a return on average assets of -.92% and a return on average common shareholders' equity of -11.5%. Finally, we are encouraged by what we regard as one of the most important measures of our normalized earnings power: pre-tax pre-provision income. During a credit cycle, all financial institutions experience heightened credit costs. Pre-tax pre-provision income reflects the underlying earnings power of a company. This measure increased 5.9% to $3.7 billion in 2009 from a year earlier, which we consider a very positive number in a difficult environment. While our results are certainly lower than BB&T's historical numbers ­ and we are never satisfied with lower results ­ they are among the strongest results in the financial services industry.

Faye Bordeaux, LCSW, Chief Executive Officer, Cambridge Behavioral Health Services, PLLC, Greenville, N.C.

With a mission of serving individuals with emotional and behavioral challenges, Faye and Frankie Bordeaux dreamed of opening a behavioral health practice and needed a strong financial institution to finance the building purchase. BB&T responded with a loan for the new facility, and have since financed the construction of two more facilities. Today, the Bordeauxes have a multi-million-dollar practice in two locations, offering counseling, medication management, case management and other services. BB&T's consultative approach has yielded a long-lasting relationship, now managed by Business Services Officer Tommy Price. The relationship includes providing deposit accounts, employee benefit plans, wealth management, cash management and merchant and payroll services. "Because BB&T is our one-stop shop for banking, we can focus our energy on helping patients and building our practice," says Chief Operating Officer Frankie Bordeaux.

OUR STOCK PERFORMANCE
The bottom line in BB&T's mission is to optimize the long-term return to our shareholders, while providing a safe and sound investment. As investors know too well, the last decade has been a difficult period for stock prices. In fact, the last 10 years is the first time since the 1930s when there was a negative return on stocks. But in this very volatile environment for stock prices, particularly shares of financial services companies, your company has been a hallmark of steady performance. While our 10-year performance certainly is not as good as we would like, BB&T did post a modest gain while the banking industry and the S&P both suffered declines. For the periods ended December 31, 2009, we outperformed an average of our peers over the last 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 years. Even considering the erosion of stock prices that began in 2007, a $100 investment in BB&T shares in 1995 was worth $315 on December 31, 2009 ­ significantly better than the S&P 500. Dividends also are very important to our shareholders, and a very important responsibility for BB&T. Your company has paid a cash dividend every year since 1903. By far the most difficult decision for me in 2009 ­ and the worst day in my 37-year banking career ­ was having to reduce BB&T's annual dividend to $.60 per share. I believe it was a prudent and necessary decision to help us maintain a strong capital position throughout this economic downturn, and, considering our levels of earnings in recent quarters, the reduction was required by banking regulations. I also believe the dividend reduction is a temporary measure. I know how much many of our shareholders depend on our dividends. I promise you that I and our leadership team are working as hard as we possibly can to improve earnings. When economic conditions improve and our earnings levels permit an increase in the dividend, we are committed to increasing the dividend to an appropriate level. We continue to target a 40% to 60% payout of our earnings to our shareholders. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2009, we earned $.27 per share and paid out $.15 per share, or a 56% payout. Finally, like our stock price, our current dividend still compares very favorably with our peers. We were the last large bank to reduce our dividend, and we continue to pay a premium compared to other large banks and all but one of our peers. While it was a painful decision in the short term, I believe it will prove to be in the best interest of our shareholders and the company over the long term.

2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

OUR CAPITAL STRENGTH
In the midst of the nation's most severe financial crisis since the 1930s, BB&T demonstrated that its capital levels are among the strongest in the industry. Capital, a key measure of a bank's financial health, is the margin by which creditors are covered if the bank's assets are liquidated. In the fourth quarter of 2008, the federal government's concern about bank failures prompted the Treasury Department and banking regulators to strongly encourage even well-capitalized institutions such as BB&T to accept government investment to increase capital levels as part of its Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. As I said in last year's report, we were determined to exit TARP as soon as possible because the accompanying excessive government regulations are inconsistent with our free-market principles and harmful to shareholders. I am pleased to report that your company was among the first financial institutions in the country to meet the government's standards to exit the program. In May, BB&T exceeded the government's minimum "stress test" requirements under a "more adverse" economic scenario that projected a prolonged and deepening recession ­ assumptions more severe than BB&T's estimates. The test, conducted by federal regulatory officials using rigorous forward-looking criteria, showed that BB&T surpassed minimum requirements for regulatory and tangible capital. In the year since the stress test, BB&T has outperformed the government's projections for earnings by $576 million and outperformed expectations for losses by $2.4 billion. In June, BB&T received regulatory approval and bought back the preferred stock it sold to the U.S. Treasury in November 2008. In addition to $3.1 billion to repurchase the stock, BB&T paid the government a total of $92.7 million in dividend payments and paid $67 million to repurchase the warrant from the government ­ amounting to an 8.4% rate of return, an excellent investment for the American taxpayer. At the same time, BB&T has remained committed to helping meet the TARP's original spirit of thawing frozen credit markets. As we proudly proclaim with the "Still Strong, Still Lending" banners in front of our branches, we continue to actively pursue and make every good loan we can find. Our loan originations exceeded $75 billion in 2009. At December 31, 2009, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and total risk-based capital ratio were 11.5% and 15.8%, respectively, compared with 11.1% and 15.6%, respectively, at September 30, 2009. Our Tier 1 common ratio, a measure of tangible capital, was 8.5% at December 31, 2009, ranking second in our peer group. These ratios all remain well above regulatory standards for wellcapitalized banks. Our strong capital position both bolsters your company during the current credit cycle and gives us the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities as we emerge from the economic downturn.

To build on their 100-year history in the construction industry, the Murphy family was eager to consolidate their corporate investment, debt and treasury management requirements. The family also valued their 14-year relationship and accounts with Colonial Bank. When BB&T purchased Colonial's Florida operations, BB&T City Executive Robert Bowlby and Business Deposits Officer Lina Macki, who had long handled the family's corporate accounts at Colonial, quickly offered a solution that met the family's needs and preserved the relationship. With its solid capital base, BB&T offered a secure place for the multi-million-dollar cash-investment balance of the family's company, Coastal Construction, along with business loans and financing that were previously managed by Colonial. The builder also turned to BB&T for treasury management tools that now help Coastal efficiently handle thousands of transactions, including checks, wires, investments and payments, on a secure and timely basis. Among Coastal's many projects is this expansion and renovation of Miami's Southside Elementary Museums Magnet School.

2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

OUR COLONIAL BANK ACQUISITION
Our acquisition of Colonial Bank in August 2009 was a strategically compelling and financially attractive transaction that has exceeded all of our rigorous criteria for acquisitions. The transaction has four key benefits:
Expands and enhances BB&T's franchise in key markets Protects BB&T from losses from substantially all acquired loans and securities

BB&T's goal is to be in the top five in deposit market share in all of our markets. The transaction propelled us to No. 5 in Florida (from No. 11) and opened new markets in the burgeoning South Florida communities. We moved up dramatically in Alabama to No. 4 (from No. 55) and are well-positioned to benefit from market turmoil caused by several bank failures and takeovers in that state. We bolstered our No. 5 ranking in Georgia, with notable gains in Atlanta and Columbus. The acquisition also gave us a foothold in the important Texas market, with its huge population (24.8 million in Texas versus 18.5 million in Florida and 9.4 million in North Carolina) and diverse economy. Our 22 financial centers in the Dallas and Austin markets ­ while representing a small share of the market ­ complement our existing commercial insurance and mortgage businesses in Texas. We are committed to expanding our presence in the state over time. Though larger size is not a goal of our acquisitions, it is worth noting that the Colonial transaction is the largest acquisition in BB&T's 138-year history and makes us the nation's 10th largest financial holding company by deposits. The Colonial acquisition also was ranked No. 3 in Time magazine's top 10 business deals of 2009.

BB&T emerged as a top candidate to take over Colonial, the largest of 140 U.S. bank failures in 2009, because of our ongoing strength during the financial crisis. Under an agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, BB&T assumed all of Colonial's $19.2 billion in deposit accounts, but did not acquire any of the assets or assume any obligations from Colonial's holding company. BB&T purchased $19.6 billion of assets, with essentially all either covered by FDIC loss-sharing protection or risk-free assets like cash. The FDIC will cover 80% of losses and share some of our upside if losses are less than $5 billion, and assumes 95% of losses above $5 billion. BB&T's responsibility for the 20% of the first $5 billion has already been recorded. If the entire covered portfolio were charged off, BB&T's maximum exposure would be less than $500 million before taxes. One of our most important requirements for acquisitions in this credit environment is to protect our balance sheet from additional credit risk. The Colonial deal meets that goal very well.

Dr. Marc Bendickson, Dynetics Inc., Chairman & CEO, Huntsville, Ala.

A leader in engineering, scientific and information technology for the U.S. government and other business sectors, Dynetics was on the verge of closing its deposit account with the failing Colonial Bank. After BB&T announced its acquisition of Colonial's banking operations, Alabama State President Dontá L. Wilson and Commercial Lending Officer Herman Stubbs swiftly arranged to meet with company leaders to rescue the relationship. Wilson and Stubbs personally assured Dynetics of BB&T's strength, commitment to helping clients and knowledge of government contracts and services. As a result, Dynetics chose to continue its services and immediately moved a money-market account worth several million dollars to BB&T from a competing bank. The key reasons for the decision: BB&T's long tradition of conservative management, ability to offer a seamless transition and attractive services including wealth management and insurance. "We were impressed with BB&T and its strong state leadership, and felt comfortable putting our business in their hands," says Dr. Bendickson.

2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

Provides immediate earnings contribution

Creates opportunities for growth

Using conservative assumptions, the transaction exceeds BB&T's merger criteria. This immediate positive effect on earnings includes the impact of issuing 38.5 million shares of common stock at $26 per share to raise proceeds of $963 million in connection with the acquisition. We have a proven track record of achieving cost-savings targets in acquisitions. In this transaction, we anticipate reducing 30% of the Colonial cost base, or $170 million pre-tax annually, offsetting an estimated $185 million pre-tax in one-time merger and integration costs.

Colonial's franchise, widely coveted in the banking industry, was not performing up to its potential because of the bank's financial problems. We have created new community bank regions, which allow decision-making close to the client, and introduced BB&T's broader array of products and services. Already, Colonial and BB&T employees, working seamlessly side-by-side, have retained and expanded our relationship with many of Colonial's clients. In Alabama, for example, we have won deposits and loans from competitors because of BB&T's long record of financial strength. Amazingly, employees in the former Colonial branches have grown deposits by $1.5 billion since the August 14 acquisition date and have originated $334 million in loans.

Texas Regional President Kay St. John sees exciting prospects for BB&T's growing presence in one of the nation's largest states. With nearly three decades of financial services leadership experience in Texas, St. John is enthusiastic about the state's robust business climate, particularly in the commercial, industrial and real estate markets. In addition to leading the bank's regional business, retail and mortgage operations, her goal is to provide the resources needed to build awareness and meet the needs of clients and local communities. "Our team is hitting the ground running and we have the right suite of products and services to help existing and new Texas clients," says Ms. St. John.

2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

OUR VALUES
We believe our values are the underlying reason for our success. That has never been more true than during the difficult times of the last two years. People are disillusioned and skeptical about the financial sector, causing some banks to seek to redefine themselves. At BB&T, we have never had to redefine ourselves. We figured out who we were long before this financial crisis, and the last one. By remaining true to fundamental values that are deeply rooted in our history and culture, we are not distracted by trends that come and go. We did not rush in to embrace the exotic mortgages and other flashy products that have haunted some other financial institutions, largely because such products would not be beneficial to our clients, and therefore would be inconsistent with our mission. Our values are the "heart and soul" of how we choose to live our organizational life, and how we make our everyday decisions. Our values are our beliefs. People behave in a manner that is consistent with their beliefs. Honesty is our bedrock value, as you see depicted in the accompanying illustration. Without honesty, there can be no trust. Without trust, there can be no meaningful relationships. And without relationships, there can be no advancement as an organization or a society. Particularly now, after so many financial scandals and other violations of trust, people form relationships only with individuals and institutions they trust. Our values help us achieve our vision of creating the best financial institution possible. They also help us "live" our mission of serving our clients, nurturing our employees, supporting our communities and rewarding our shareholders. The first part of our mission is to help our clients achieve economic success and financial security. It is worthwhile work and one of the most important relationship responsibilities in the world because finances are crucial in helping people achieve their dreams and goals in life. We achieve that mission by offering products that meet their needs, and service that is reliable, responsive, empathetic and competent. The second part of our mission is to create a place where employees can learn, grow and be fulfilled in their work. We achieve that with continuous training that instills our values. Our mission also requires that we support our communities, and we achieve that by contributing our money and more importantly our time, as you'll see when you read about our Lighthouse Project in the next section of this report. Finally, by living our mission, we achieve our bottom line as a company: optimizing the long-term return to our shareholders, while providing a safe and sound investment. Of course, our values, vision and mission are just words on a page unless all of the individuals who make up BB&T both believe and practice them. That's why we also stress in our employee training programs what I call the characteristics of outstanding achievers. They include believing absolutely that BB&T will become the best financial institution possible, committing the time, energy, resources and training to get the job done, and enjoying the journey. But the most important characteristic is an Enthusiastic Positive Attitude about work and life ­ an attitude that we believe our clients and communities share with our employees.

2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

OUR LIGHTHOUSE PROJECT
My proudest moment in 2009 was watching our employees live our mission by helping ­ on a very personal level ­ the communities we serve. In our Lighthouse Project, we sponsored more than 1,000 hands-on community service projects that touched the lives of more than 1.6 million people in 25 states. BB&T distributed approximately $3 million, based on a $100 contribution for each of our 30,000 employees. But much more important than the money was the time BB&T employees contributed to personally select and then complete a project that would give a boost to their communities during these tough economic times. We renovated daycare centers and school playgrounds, painted Habitat for Humanity houses, assembled toys, packaged school supplies, stocked food pantries, taught children to swim, conducted museum tours, prepared care packages for overseas troops and much, much more. Many employees told me it was a life-changing experience for them, and almost half of those who responded to a company survey said they gave additional time to the organization they chose for the Lighthouse Project. Employees also said they've noticed improved teamwork in the office as a result of rolling up their sleeves together for their communities. They've shared their excitement with their clients. And, based on the overwhelmingly positive response, we have committed to sponsor the Lighthouse Project again in 2010. To quote one employee in our survey: "I'm proud to be part of an organization that is big enough to meet the needs of even the most sophisticated investors, but not too big to kneel to help a child or other individual in need."

RONALD MCDONALD HOUSE Roanoke, Virginia The Ronald McDonald House in Roanoke, Virginia, had limited resources to make needed improvements in its housing for families of pediatric patients. More than 300 BB&T volunteers pitched in, replacing the home's blinds and lighting, installing new picnic tables and benches and supplying the playground with 1,400 square feet of mulch, making it safer for children to use. "Thanks to BB&T, we are able to give our families a house that feels more like home," said Executive Director Laney Mofield.

STANDUP FOR KIDS Orange County, California Staff from BB&T Insurance Services teamed with STANDUP FOR KIDS, a nonprofit organization that benefits at-risk children, to address the needs of homeless youth in Orange County, California. Employees donated 200 backpacks stuffed with school supplies, as well as 56 sleeping bags and 100 survival kits containing food and hygiene products. "We were overwhelmed by BB&T's generosity," said Executive Director Justine Madison. "The donation came at the perfect time."

UNITED SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS Atlanta, Georgia Two dozen BB&T employees showed their appreciation for military personnel and their families by volunteering at the United Services Organizations (USO) Center in Atlanta. In addition to donating funds, employees served as greeters, assembled 500 USO care packages and distributed lunches. The USO Center serves as a coordination point for incoming and outgoing members of the U.S. armed forces. "The heart of the USO is its volunteers. BB&T's presence and help lifted the spirits of our troops," said Executive Director Mary Lou Austin.

OUR KEY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES FOR 2010
Clear, consistent long-term goals are essential for the success of any organization, especially during the volatile and uncertain times we've been experiencing. The penalty for ill-prepared banks is heavy: In 2009, 140 banks failed, up from 25 in 2008 and three in 2007. Even though the economy is showing signs of recovery, more failures are forecast for 2010. The banking industry's challenges are daunting: the aftermath of the deepest global economic recession in decades, increased risk in the financial and real estate markets, intense competition, increasing regulatory cost, and overcapacity in the financial services industry. The winners over the long term will be those financial services companies with strong cultures, rational strategies, superior processes and exceptional executional abilities. To assure BB&T is one of the winners, we have never wavered from our long-term goal of creating a superior earnings-per-share growth rate without sacrificing the fundamental quality and long-term competitiveness of our business, nor taking unreasonable risk. Strategies and tactics may vary, but four principles form the foundation for our goal:  · Client-driven service with a passion for consistently  providing better value, based on higher service  quality relative to price  · Rational risk taking and exceptional risk management  · Superior earnings growth  · Targeted and consistent investments for the future BB&T's strategic objectives for 2010 are consistent with our long-term goals and these principles.
Effectively Manage through the Credit Cycle

For the third consecutive year, the ability to manage credit costs will be the number one driver of BB&T's performance. We are encouraged by signs of stabilization. In Florida, where we experienced the highest loss rates due to the substantial drop in home values, delinquency rates flattened out in the fourth quarter. For BB&T as a whole, the rate of growth in nonperforming assets declined throughout 2009, to 7% in the fourth quarter from 35.5% in the first quarter. For 2010, we expect that trend to continue and currently believe charge-offs will be flat for the full year compared to 2009. That said, the economy remains uncertain, so we must maintain our intensive risk-management focus, including early identification of problems, reducing our real estate exposure and allocating more resources to collections and risk management. We have reassigned 500 employees from loan production to loan administration as we aggressively work through credit problems. Our commercial real estate portfolio is diversified and we follow a strict project limit of $25 million, which effectively prohibits BB&T's involvement in high-rise offices, condos and hotels, large retail centers and other projects that have shown the most distress. Consistent with BB&T's mission, we seek solutions that are in the best interest of our clients, communities and shareholders. We work cooperatively with our borrowers, offering loan-modification programs when appropriate, during these difficult economic times. When foreclosure on real estate is necessary, our goal is to both maximize the return on BB&T's investment in the property while avoiding bulk sales at depressed prices that undermine property values in the communities we serve.

2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

Achieve Superior Revenue Growth

During difficult times, organizations often focus all of their energy on damage control and forget about growth. During 2009, many financial services firms were faced with that dilemma because of problem-plagued loan portfolios and increased federal government involvement in their businesses. BB&T has fared much better than most of our peers, in large part because of our disciplined lending standards, and remains focused on both growth and credit quality. A "flight to quality" to BB&T by clients from weakened competitors, aided by our FDIC-assisted acquisition of Colonial Bank, contributed to our record net revenues in 2009. Throughout the credit crisis, your company has posted industry-leading revenue growth, with a 25.6% increase during the last two years. This is due in large part to our ability to continue to invest in our revenue engine during the credit downturn. We will again invest in 2010 by hiring top producers, pursuing strategic acquisitions like Colonial, adding branches and developing systems and infrastructure. Our diversified business model ­ balanced approximately 50-50 between retail and commercial revenue ­ produces a less volatile, more predictable revenue and earnings stream. We will continue to build our core banking business in a 12-state footprint that extends from Maryland to Florida, west to Kentucky, and now into Texas with the Colonial acquisition. We are aggressively expanding our small business lending and rank as one of the most active banks in SBA financing. We are expanding our Capital Markets team to serve the financing needs of middlemarket companies. BB&T was recognized in 2009 by Greenwich Associates as an Excellence Award winner in

20 out of 20 national categories ­ more than any other financial institution ­ in small business and middlemarket banking. In addition, at a time many small and mid-sized businesses have negative opinions about most financial institutions, BB&T was accorded the highest positive reputation score by executives of those businesses among banks surveyed by Greenwich, a leading global financial services research and consulting firm. At the same time, we are expanding our fee-income businesses on a national scale. Our retail mortgage banking, insurance agency and wealth management businesses, as well as Scott & Stringfellow, our full-service regional brokerage firm, all posted record results. BB&T Insurance Services, the nation's seventh-largest insurance broker, surpassed $1 billion in revenue. In a move complemented by our acquisition of Colonial Bank, BB&T Insurance Services also increased its presence in southwest Florida with the acquisition of Oswald Trippe and Company Inc. of Fort Myers. Grandbridge Real Estate Capital LLC, BB&T's commercial and multifamily mortgage banking firm, expanded with acquisitions in Dallas and Louisville, Kentucky. We will pursue other non-bank acquisitions in insurance, mortgage, consumer finance and commercial finance. We believe the "reintermediation" trend of this past year will continue as investors' funds flow into banks from non-banking investments. Loans that left the traditional banking system and flowed to the "shadow" banking system in the past 20 years will return because of the demise of that system, and loan prices will be more rational. At the same time, Wall Street firms that previously enjoyed an advantage over traditional banks

will be encumbered by increased government oversight. As the economy stabilizes and ultimately recovers, we believe BB&T's tested core banking services are well positioned for accelerated growth.

Deliver the BB&T Value Promise (...Thereby Creating the Perfect Client Experience)

"Highest in Customer Satisfaction with Primary Mortgage Sales."

BB&T's value promise starts with a simple greeting to our clients: "You've made an excellent choice by selecting BB&T. Let me tell you why." Our employees then explain their job and training, describe BB&T and our values ­ and most importantly show how they will meet their clients' needs better than anyone else. While price is always important in any business environment, we believe our simple promise of delivering the greatest value ­ the highest quality service ­ distinguishes BB&T from our competitors. Our value promise is also at the heart of delivering BB&T's Perfect Client Experience: service that is reliable, responsive, empathetic and competent. Particularly after the financial crisis of the last two years, consumers rightfully are demanding to know what they are receiving for their hard-earned money and life-long savings. We could not deliver on our promise without another BB&T hallmark: our community banking structure. While we have grown tremendously in recent years, we have retained a hometown banking approach with 37 community banking regions ­ each headed by a regional president empowered to offer all of the advantages and services of a major financial institution as well as the specializedRetail attention that our clients expect from a Banking Maritz Research hometown bank.

2009 ANNUAL REVIEW

Of course, it is easy to promise great service and hometown values. Everyone does it. At BB&T, we have independent validation of our client service record. Maritz Research's survey of clients of BB&T and of our in-market competitors showed we again ranked No. 1 in overall retail and commercial client satisfaction and likelihood to remain a client, among other categories. J.D. Power and Associates, which awarded BB&T its top national ranking for mortgage servicing two years in a row, added another accolade in 2009: the highest ranking in mortgage loan origination client satisfaction. We are also proud that our recognition for superior service extends into many of our lines of business, including wealth management, small business lending, 401(k) retirement plan sponsorship, sales finance and stock research. The excellent client service behind all of these awards is possible because of an underlying service we provide our own employees: BB&T training. Our training programs again won national recognition from Training Magazine and the American Society for Training and Development.

Control Costs

In a slow-growth environment, we must be relentless in controlling costs. We have done that with lean budgets and increased productivity. BB&T's efficiency ratio ­ basically, the cost required to generate each dollar of revenue ­ improved to 50.4% from 51.4% two years ago. In contrast, our peers' efficiency ratio has deteriorated to 60.6% from 56.0% in 2007. At the same time, while many of our competitors announced major layoffs and cuts in employee benefit programs, BB&T has been able to largely retain our talented workforce and continue investing in vital employee development and training programs. Cost control remains crucial in an environment with higher FDIC insurance and other regulatory costs, more resources devoted to mitigating credit problems and other financial pressures. We will continue intense scrutiny on full-time-equivalent positions, needlessly complex programs and projects that have inordinately long payback periods. Our resources will be allocated based on their potential to maximize profits.

THANK YOU
In closing, I want to express my profound appreciation to John Allison, who stepped down as chairman of BB&T at the end of 2009. I am looking forward to his continued counsel as a member of our corporate board of directors. In a fitting tribute to his two decades of leadership of BB&T and in our industry, American Banker awarded John its Lifetime Achievement Award for 2009, citing his "career full of conviction." I also want to salute Nelle Chilton and Tom Efird, who retired as members of the corporate board of directors, for their years of dedication and board leadership. They contributed mightily to BB&T's success with their strong personal values, business acumen and intellectual insight. In addition, I want to welcome three new members of the corporate board, who joined in 2009:  ·        ·        ·       K. David Boyer, Jr., Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of GlobalWatch Technologies, Inc., an information-services company based in metro Washington, D.C. He also is a member of the Commonwealth of Virginia's Treasury Board, which supervises the investment of state funds, among other responsibilities. J. Littleton "Litt" Glover, Jr., a metro Atlanta lawyer who also is President and Chief Executive Officer of Batson-Cook Development Company, which develops commercial real estate throughout the  southeastern U.S. For the last 10 years, he has been  a director of Branch Banking and Trust Company,  our principal subsidiary. Tom Skains, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Piedmont Natural Gas, a  Charlotte-based company serving one million  residential, commercial and industrial utility clients  in the Carolinas and Tennessee. A leader in the  natural gas industry for 30 years, Tom was chairman  of the American Gas Association in 2009. I also want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on BB&T's Executive Management team. The team has come together quickly over the past year and is highly committed to the success of BB&T. For the last 138 years, BB&T has survived and thrived through all sorts of market cycles. The current cycle has been the most challenging in my career, and I'm proud that your company again is emerging as one of the strongest in the financial services industry. We have unwavering values that guide us. We have an experienced and highly motivated team; the average age of our executive management team is 50, with an average of 28 years experience with BB&T. We have a diversified, stable business mix that is resilient in all operating environments. We have a community banking model that produces the best value proposition in the industry. We have great markets and a great franchise. We have a proven track record in managing our credit portfolio and integrating mergers with discipline. In 2010 and beyond, we have the best opportunity in our history to achieve our goal of building the best financial institution possible. The challenges are not going to disappear, but with the continued support of our talented employees, loyal clients and steadfast shareholders, I am confident we will be successful. I truly believe our best days are ahead!
