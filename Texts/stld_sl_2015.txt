Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer
On behalf of everyone at Steel Dynamics, I convey our gratitude to our loyal customers, vendors and shareholders for the support of our company. And, my heartfelt thanks to our extraordinary employees for your passion, innovation and dedication
to excellence.

                     Driven by the strong U.S. dollar, low iron ore cost and global excess steel production capacity, steel imports were 2015’s principal headwind. Imports as a percentage of domestic consumption remained at historically high levels in 2015, representing 29% of annual domestic steel consumption. Excessive steel import volume—combined with high customer inventory levels—limited U.S. steel mill utilization and pressured domestic steel pricing. While Steel Dynamics’ production utilization remained well above our peers and the industry, there is certainly more to be achieved.
Although these challenges created highly competitive market conditions in the metals industry, our employees performed exceptionally well, driving financial metrics that again were at the top of our industry peer group. Despite record steel and steel fabrication volumes, our annual 2015 revenues were $7.6 billion compared to $8.8 billion in 2014, based on significantly lower product pricing. The dramatic drop in global commodity prices caused the average annual 2015 ferrous selling price for our metals recycling operations to decline over 36% year-over- year.
Additionally, due to unfairly traded steel imports, the average annual 2015 selling price for our steel operations decreased 18%. Our adjusted annual 2015 operating income was $398 million, with adjusted net income of $178 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, excluding non-cash asset impairment and other charges related to our metals recycling and ferrous resource operations, and first quarter 2015 refinancing costs.
SAFETY IS OUR #1 VALUE
Nothing is more important than creating and maintaining a safe work environment for every employee. We have improved our recordable incident rate for each of the last five years and we again achieved a record low recordable incident rate in 2015. Even though our metrics remain meaningfully better than industry averages—our goal is higher—it’s a ZERO safety incident work environment. Over half of our locations achieved this objective for 2015—now we need to realize this result everywhere. Collectively, we must ensure every employee is engaged, taking personal responsibility for creating and maintaining a safe working environment. Safety is our highest priority.

                 8 2015 ANNUAL REPORT FROM THE DESK OF MARK D. MILLETT
KEY 2015 GROWTH INITIATIVES
During 2015, we executed several key initiatives to support our strategic growth:
     In September 2014, we completed our largest acquisition by acquiring
a 3.2 million ton flat roll steel mill located in Columbus, Mississippi, for $1.6 billion. This was a step-change transaction for Steel Dynamics and introduced another state-of-the-art mini-mill to our portfolio. Columbus Flat Roll Division (Columbus) increased our total annual steel capacity by more than 40%, from 7.8 million tons to 11.0 million tons, and broadened our product capabilities while expanding our geographic reach into the southern United States and Mexico. During 2015, the Columbus team made tremendous progress toward diversifying its product mix and customer base from energy-related markets and toward the strong automotive and growing construction sectors. Columbus added over 100 new and valued customers in 2015. Market shifts take time, but we are already seeing the benefit with committed new 2016 automotive business. Additionally, the team has done a fantastic
job of reducing their operating
cost structure, while improving production rates and product quality.
Our $100 million paint line and Galvalume® expansion at Columbus will be a significant catalyst of growth, providing 250,000 tons
of value-added coating capacity. The project groundbreaking
took place in February 2016, and we expect to begin operations
in the first quarter of 2017. This investment further diversifies the mill’s end markets into higher- margin products, de-emphasizing commodity-grade steel. We plan to produce appliance-grade,
and heating and air conditioning quality steel.
The expansion at our Engineered Bar Products Division was completed mid-year 2014, and gained market momentum during 2015. The $96 million investment increased our production capacity at that facility by 52% to 950,000 tons, ranking us among the largest single-site suppliers of engineered special-bar-quality steels in North America. This diversification into smaller-diameter bars was critical to the division’s 2015 performance.
It allowed us to maintain a higher volume through market share gains, as smaller bars are typically used in the automotive industry, and the medium and larger bar market dramatically weakened as a result of poor energy, agriculture and heavy equipment demand.
 Our quality and service performance continues to receive outstanding ratings as measured by our customers. This is a testament to our drive to provide superior customer service and high-quality products. We are focused on providing exceptional value to our customers, committing to the highest levels of quality and timeliness, and as importantly, partnering with them
to deliver what they need today as well as anticipate what they will need for tomorrow.

  IGNITING OUR FUTURE
As we enter 2016, there are many factors at play that align the macro environment to provide the opportunity for improved domestic steel mill utilization. Based on anticipated trade case rulings, unfairly traded steel imports are expected to decline. Domestic steel inventory levels have realigned with actual consumption and demand from the automotive and construction sectors is expected to stay steady. Steel Dynamics has growing exposure to both of these
sectors through our Columbus Flat Roll Division, additional long products production capability, and growing steel fabrication operations. While concerns surrounding global growth have resulted in considerable market volatility, the fundamentals for the United States remain intact. Non-residential construction continues to improve, and as
one of the single largest steel- consuming sectors, this bodes well for the domestic steel industry. Additionally, automotive, the second largest steel- consuming sector, continues
to remain strong.
As non-residential construction continues to improve, all of
our operating platforms should benefit. Our steel fabrication operations have additional capacity to grow both in volume and market share as the markets improve. Additionally, based
on 2015 steel shipments of
8.3 million tons, we have over 2.6 million tons of additional steel shipping capability—a significant portion of which is leveraged to the continuing improvement in the construction market. Finally, if domestic
steel mill utilization improves, demand for ferrous scrap should follow, bringing benefit to our metals recycling operations.
We remain the lowest-cost domestic steel producer with one of the most diversified product offerings in the industry. The variability within our operating costs provides strong cash flow generation through market cycles. We have record levels of liquidity and a strong credit profile. We generated over $1.0 billion of cash flow from operations during 2015. We are poised for continued growth.
We continue to drive toward maximizing opportunities to
Structural and Rail Division Columbia City, Indiana
effectively perform through
all market cycles, maintaining sustainable differentiation
from our peers. We assess opportunities for the growth and consistency of profit margins. Our capital allocation strategy includes high-return organic
and inorganic growth initiatives and positive dividend trends, while maintaining an appropriate credit profile.
As we look toward 2016, we
are optimistic regarding the opportunities that lie ahead for Steel Dynamics and for those we impact. The passion and spirit
of our employees compel us
to a standard of excellence—to perform at the highest level.
I thank each of them for their hard work and dedication, and remind them—safety is the first priority—always.
Sincerely,
Mark D. Millett

A Letter to You
Despite the domestic steel industry challenges in 2015, we continued to execute on our strategic initiatives, while further strengthening an already solid financial foundation. We maintained our focus on remaining a low-cost, highly efficient, customer-centric steel company. Throughout market cycles, our unique operating culture and low, highly variable cost structure allows us to achieve strong levels of cash flow. Our 2015 adjusted operating income of $398 million was 35% lower than our 2014 adjusted results, yet we generated over $1.0 billion of cash flow from operations.

   A testament to our disciplined approach to growth, creating shareholder value through sound capital allocation and an efficient balance sheet—and consistent
with our preference to maintain an appropriate credit profile—we reduced debt by $350 million in the first quarter of 2015, reducing a portion of the additional debt we had issued to acquire Columbus in September 2014. Correspondingly, based on our additional cash flow generation capability related to the addition of Columbus, we increased our annual cash dividend to shareholders 20% in the first quarter of 2015, evidencing our continued confidence in the strength of our cash generation capacity, financial position and optimism concerning our future prospects.

                 Despite the increased debt associated with the recent acquisition of Columbus, combined with the challenging industry environment experienced in 2015, we achieved record liquidity and our credit profile remained solid. At December 31,
2015, our liquidity was $1.9 billion, comprised of our undrawn $1.2 billion revolving credit facility and $727 million of available cash. At the end of 2015, our net debt was $1.9 billion, with corresponding net leverage of 2.7 times—a profile aligned with our preferred through-cycle level of less than 3.0 times net leverage.

Our current capital allocation plans for 2016 include additional investments of between $250 and $300 million— which includes our announced $100 million investment at Columbus which is intended to further diversify its product offerings into higher-value-added painted products.
Current operations and growth will be aligned with our attention toward sustainability of resources within our entire operational structure to allow for additional growth, including, among many other aspects:
Our environmental stewardship through the collection
of scrap metal to reuse in our furnaces to generate new steel products and our commitment to high environmental standards in all areas
Our social stewardship through both the positive financial impact of our charitable foundation which has donated to the communities in which our employees work and live, and the human impact of our employees through their encouraged volunteerism
Our human capital stewardship through the importance of safety and employee development to benefit long-term success and growth of shareholder value
Our overall financial strategy is to be the safest and lowest- cost steel producer of high-quality, broadly diversified, value-added products, creating the highest margins. Through our exceptional operating culture, experienced employee base and performance-based incentive programs, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of each opportunity. Our growth must be additive to margins, counter-cyclical where possible, and be in areas where our culture of performance-based incentive compensation and ownership mentality can thrive. We are creating shareholder value through a sound capital allocation strategy and an efficient and flexible capital structure.
As we look to 2016, we see opportunity. We are uniquely positioned to have the financial foundation to not only sustain and enhance our current operations, but to also continue our prudent growth objectives, during this prolonged challenging environment for the steel and metals recycling industries.
Sincerely,
Theresa E. Wagler
