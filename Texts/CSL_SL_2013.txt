 Carlisle 2013 annual report DEAR CARliSlE ShAREhOlDERS:
2013 will be characterized as a year of record sales and net earnings, significant increase in shareholder value
and strategic progress. It was the fourth year in a row that we set a new sales record and the second con- secutive year that we set a net earnings record. Our sales for the year exceeded $2.9 billion, a 3% increase over the previous record set last year. Net earnings for the year were $235 million, a 3% increase over last year’s earnings. 2013 was also a year of exceptional cash generation. Our cash conversion rate was 110%. We ended 2013 with $755 million in cash, also a record for the Company.
On December 24, 2013, our price per share hit an all-time high, closing at $79.62. Our share price gained 35% in value during 2013, 79% for the 2-year prior period and 100% for the 3-year prior period. This compares very favorably to our Peer Group, the S&P 500 and the S&P MidCap 400 as shown in the chart and graph on page 6, upper right. We also increased our dividend 10% in 2013, which was our 37th consecutive year of dividend increases.
We took a significant strategic step in December, when we sold the transportation products business (CTP) for $375 million. Selling the tire and wheel business was not an easy decision, but it was the right decision. Since 1917, the tire business had been the heart and soul of our Company. It funded the growth of Carlisle for more than 80 years and generated respectable levels of profitability and growth until the late 1990s when foreign competition stiffened and our products became a commodity. Following those market changes, the business went from being our highest profit margin segment to our lowest. We took steps to improve profit- ability and did, but not to the level that we expect from a core business. It was evident that CTP had limited opportunity to be a long-term contributor to our strategic financial goals going forward. We received a fair price and found a good home for it at AIP, the private equity group that bought the business.
In 2013, we continued to invest in the organic growth of our business. We began to see a recovery in the non-residential construction market in the later part of 2011 and decided that we needed to add capacity to support the forecasted market growth in 2013 and beyond. Most of the $98 million of capital we invested in organic growth during 2013 was to expand our Carlisle Construction Materials manufacturing footprint. We built two new Polyiso insulation plants, one in Puyallup, Washington, and a replacement plant for our Kingston, New York, facility in Montgomery, New York. We also started construction on two new roofing membrane plants, a PVC factory in Greenville, Illinois, and a TPO factory in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. These facilities will provide us the needed capacity to meet the growth in commercial real estate development over the next four to five years.

 We were able to make these investments without tapping into our revolving line of credit, in part because of the effort of our management teams to reduce our working capital as a percent of sales in each of their busi- nesses. We have been focused on improving working capital over the past six years. We had approximately 30% of our sales value tied up in working capital then. We have steadily reduced that number to 19% in 2013 as inventory turns increased to 7 turns from 6 turns and Days Sales Outstanding decreased to 54 days from the prior year’s 58 days. Despite our improvement over the past six years, we assembled the management team to discuss how we could further improve working capital and our attention turned to our ERP systems. Using cross-functional teams from across the Company, we identified changes that would fully utilize the capabilities of our systems in the management of working capital. With the changes being implemented, we expect to be below 19% in 2014 and moving closer to our overall goal of 15% over the next three years.
A strategic issue we have for 2014 is creating shareholder value with cash we generated from operations and the sale of CTP in 2013. Having cash on hand is a blessing; putting it to work requires discipline. We have a 4-pronged plan to use our cash judiciously. First, we will continue to invest in organic growth opportunities such as the factories we built and are building for Carlisle Construction Materials, in addition to the factory we are building for Carlisle Interconnect Technologies in Mexico. Second, we will seek bolt-on acquisitions for Carlisle Construction Materials, Carlisle Interconnect Technologies and Carlisle Brake & Friction. Third, we will seek an acquisition to replace CTP; a business that will present limited risk but will provide us with a high margin business that has excellent growth prospects. Fourth, we expect to be more active repurchasing shares of our stock.
Developing the talent to manage new plant start-ups, product development activities, working capital initiatives, new product marketing activities and process improvements has been a priority. We knew we couldn’t rely exclusively on outside hires if our business was to grow as planned. We would need people who understood our products, manufacturing processes and most importantly, continuous improvement driven by the Carlisle Operating System (COS). Working jointly with Indiana University’s Kelley School of Business, we developed the Carlisle Leadership Program (CLP). It is an educational process that teaches existing employees to think strategically while managing their day-to-day operations. If an employee is lucky enough to be chosen to go through CLP, they spend three months immersed in a project with team members from other Carlisle busi- nesses developing a solution to a real world Carlisle problem. They spend part of that time on campus in Bloomington, Indiana, working with the world-class educational staff at the Kelley School. The people who attend CLP are some of our best and brightest. Many CLP graduates have been promoted within a year of graduating and are doing a terrific job in their new assignments.

 We also have been working with the Kelley School’s MBA program, hiring two to four people at the end of each educational year to participate in our management rotation program for the first twelve months of their career at Carlisle. During that time, these gifted employees spend three months within each of our businesses working on a meaningful business project. Upon completion of their rotation program, they assume a man- agement position in one of our businesses.
In the past, I have provided you with a summary of each of the business’ performance in my Shareholder Letter. This year, I have asked our Business Group Presidents to explain how their businesses performed in 2013. Who better to take you through a detailed review than John Altmeyer, John Berlin and Chris Koch. They are very talented executives and the success we have enjoyed over the past number of years has been the result of their marketplace wisdom, financial expertise and manufacturing knowledge. These are the people who “make it happen” 365 days a year. You will find their commentary insightful and it can be found in the business segment reviews in this report.
Six years ago we began a journey to create shareholder value by concentrating on fewer and more profitable businesses. We divested the businesses that were not strategic and, with the sale of the transportation prod- ucts business, the face of our business has changed. We now have four businesses capable of delivering 15% operating margins, 15% return on invested capital, utilizing 15% of our sales dollars tied up in working capital and to have 30% of our sales outside of the U.S. The one strategic objective that will take longer to achieve is the $5 billion sales goal. When we sold CTP, we lost more than $750 million in revenue and it will take us a few years to replace those sales dollars.
There’s no doubt, 2013 was a banner year for Carlisle. Every Carlisle employee worldwide contributed to our success. These are the people who have driven this business through six years of record setting performance. I am pleased they are on our side. We now put 2013 in our rear view mirror and are setting our sights on 2014 and beyond. We have once again raised the bar and are focused on higher levels of performance. Each of our businesses is led by a management team that is passionate about and intimately familiar with their products and how those products serve the needs of their customers. We thank you, our investors, for your confidence and for joining us throughout this journey...there are more great years to come.
