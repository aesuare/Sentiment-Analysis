Exelon 2013 Summary Annual Report

Letter to Our Shareholders

Dear Exelon Shareholders:
Exelon's operating performance in 2013 was exemplary. Each of our three utilities had its best year ever in reliability and customer satisfaction. Our nuclear fleet turned in its highest generation ever; and our natural gas and hydro plants were available 99% of the time the market demanded them. That performance, however, is not always properly priced in our current markets and under current energy policies. Throughout the year, low power prices, low gas prices, subsidized generation and sluggish load growth prevailed in the market and drove a declining share price. Exelon is working diligently on strategies to improve our opportunities to compete in current markets, and promote competitive market structures that appropriately compensate clean reliable generation. We are acting aggressively on both the things we can control as well as the energy and environmental policy issues we are able to influence to improve value for our shareholders. Financial Performance
Our GAAP earnings were $2.00 per diluted share in 2013, compared to $1.42 in 2012. On an operating (non-GAAP) basis, our earnings were $2.50 per diluted share, compared to $2.85 in 2012. 2013 earnings cannot be directly compared to 2012 earnings given the inclusion of Constellation and BGE in Exelon's financial results commencing in March 2012. However, the overall $0.35 decrease in non-GAAP operating earnings primarily reflects continuing declines in realized power and gas prices during 2013, in part driven by the abundance of natural gas supply, continued sluggish demand and subsidized renewable generation; these are partially offset by improved returns at the utilities, realization of additional post-merger synergies, and operational excellence. The increase in GAAP earnings reflects the adverse impact of merger-related costs in 2012, partially offset by 2013 charges for an income tax matter, the cancellation of certain nuclear uprate projects and the accounting impairment of certain wind generating assets.

Exelon 2013 Summary Annual Report

Letter to Our Shareholders

Each of our three utilities performed well financially, partly as a result of favorable weather and lower storm costs, as well as solid rate recovery and overall cost management.

Our stock price remains correlated to natural gas prices, as well as to our power markets and overall economic conditions. While 2013 calendar year spot market prices for natural gas were higher than 2012 levels, the NYMEX forward price curves were down slightly at year-end. Power prices have not yet recovered from last year's PJM capacity auction. During the course of 2013, power price forward curves dropped nearly 7 percent in PJM West and 5 percent in NiHub. These challenges were intensified by Exelon's nuclear concentration, exposure of our generation revenues to volatility in natural gas prices, and substantial presence in Midwest markets that are impacted by excess generation from subsidized renewables, flat load growth and distorted market designs. All these factors negatively affected our share price in 2013. Despite the impact of market forces on our earnings, Exelon's financial results for 2013 were essentially on plan. Each of our three utilities performed well financially, partly as a result of favorable weather and lower storm costs, as well as solid rate recovery and overall cost management. We closed out Exelon/Constellation merger integration on track to deliver more than $550 million in savings annually by the end of this year. Cost management remains a focus. We have aggressively driven costs out of our wholesale and retail operations, while originating more retail business than in any previous year. Last year's revised dividend policy has had the intended effect of bolstering our balance sheet and cash flow. Our credit metrics are strong, giving us a platform for growth.

Our nuclear fleet turned in one of its best years ever, with a capacity factor of 94.1% and record generation output.

Operating Performance
Operational results across the company in 2013 were outstanding. Each of our three utilities -- BGE, ComEd and PECO -- had its best operating year ever, tangible proof of the value of scale and the ability to leverage experience and resources. Operating performance in each utility improved over 2012 in all key metrics including safety, reliability, customer service and customer satisfaction. For all three of our utilities, customer satisfaction and outage frequency are in the top quartile of similar utilities in the U.S. Our nuclear fleet had one of its best years ever, with a capacity factor of 94.1% and record generation output. The Exelon team managing the operating services agreement at Omaha Public Power District's Ft. Calhoun nuclear plant restarted the plant after it had been offline for more than 900 days. Exelon Power had a strong year as well, with very high unit reliability in its gas, hydro, wind and solar units.

Growth Strategy and Investments
Exelon is confronting its market challenges with a defined strategy for earnings growth, based on diversification of revenue streams, utility investment, optimization of our asset base, and recovery of power market fundamentals. Execution of that strategy requires a disciplined, long-term view buttressed by the right near-term actions.

Letter to Our Shareholders

Our earnings profile and balance sheet strength enable us to act on growth and diversification opportunities when the time and price are right.

To begin with, we believe in a supply-driven recovery of power prices, and hold a portfolio position that will enable us to capitalize on our views of market recovery and earnings growth. Our earnings profile and balance sheet strength enable us to act on growth and diversification opportunities when the time and price are right. We are diligent in the identification and rigorous in the assessment of those opportunities. We added 153 MW of new solar capacity in 2013 at the Antelope Valley Solar Ranch in California, and have more than 500 MW of natural gas, contracted wind and solar power and nuclear capacity uprates in the development pipeline. The utilities will invest $15 billion over the next five years in smart meter technology, transmission projects, gas infrastructure, and electric system improvement projects, providing greater reliability and improved service for our customers and a stable return for the company. We continue to review our asset mix and work to optimize its value. We evaluate the economic viability of each of our generating units on an ongoing basis and use that assessment to identify ways to enhance their value. Our nuclear plants had their best generating year ever, but despite that performance, some are facing economic headwinds due to wholesale prices and the unintended consequences of current energy policies including subsidies like the wind production tax credit. We are assessing infrastructure, operational, commercial, policy, and legal solutions to these market pricing issues. Putting in place the right energy and tax policies is clearly the best answer. But our obligation to you, our shareholders, is clear: If we do not see a path to sustainable profitability in any of our plants, we will take steps to shut those plants down to avoid sustained losses.

Properly designed competitive markets ensure cost-effective reliable power supply and have demonstrated the ability to eliminate dirty, inefficient plants in the most efficient way.

Public Policy Advocacy
The enduring value of Exelon's business portfolio and assets depends to a very large degree on federal and state policies and regulations. One key example: low natural gas prices are not the sole threat to the viability of nuclear plants. State-sponsored preference to specific generation providers, technology-specific mandates, and the wind production tax credit are all anti-competitive market strictures that put continued operation of clean and reliable nuclear energy at risk. They cost taxpayers and consumers a lot of money, and as they threaten the economics of nuclear generation, they also put the nation's progress in reducing emissions at risk. For that reason, Exelon is and will remain a leading voice in policy debates and decision-making, particularly around our critical priorities:  Opposition to non-competitive energy subsidies  Recognition of nuclear as a clean, resilient energy source   Promotion of market rules and structures that ensure fair treatment of clean, competitive, reliable generation  Protection of the value of the grid  Equitable rate recovery structures in our utility jurisdictions

We have the financial strength and the strategic options to manage through this economic trough.

Properly designed competitive markets ensure cost-effective reliable power supply and have demonstrated the ability to eliminate dirty, inefficient plants in the most efficient way. To that end, Exelon remains active in advocating for competitive markets, opposing policies that ask either taxpayers or consumers to subsidize or give preferential treatment to specific generation providers or technologies, or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid. We have seen success in confronting individual threats to the market, but many threats remain. We need to move beyond outdated policies and allow the market to stimulate innovation and determine the most economical clean energy solutions.

Conclusion
The markets have been challenging for Exelon for the last several years, but we have the financial strength and the strategic options to manage through this economic trough. We are not simply waiting for the price recovery. We are taking action to improve our situation by finding ways to optimize our fleet value, investing in improved utility reliability and infrastructure, maintaining the operational excellence for which we are known, and advocating for tax and energy policies that best support clean, reliable energy. Our scale and depth give us strength to weather storms. Our healthy balance sheet, our sustainable dividend, and our financial discipline constitute a solid platform for sustained growth.
