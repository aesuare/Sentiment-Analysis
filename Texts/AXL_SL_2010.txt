To Our Shareholders,
In 2010, the Company repositioned itself for oil production and oil reserves growth as it started to shift its emphasis from a natural gas driller and producer to a Cardium light oil horizontal driller and oil producer. The culmination of weak natural gas markets, the weak outlook for natural gas and the Cardium horizontal oil discoveries offsetting the Company’s land in central Alberta caused the Company to completely rethink its strategy. Although this was an easy decision to make, it took time to implement as the Company had to move up the learning curve on the Cardium play, wind up some of its natural gas drilling and tie-in initiatives, and defer its shallow gas drilling commitments. As well, the Company had to finance the strategy change. 2010 was a transition year to reposition the Company for future oil production and oil reserves growth and 2011 will be the year that the Company and its shareholders will benefit from the repositioning. In January 2011, Anderson established a 2011 capital budget of $75 million almost entirely focused on drilling Cardium light oil horizontal oil wells.
Two financings were completed in 2010. In February 2010, the Company issued 21.9 million common shares at $1.45 per share for gross proceeds of $31.8 million, pursuant to a bought deal financing. The proceeds were used to commence the evaluation of the Cardium horizontal oil play. On December 31, 2010, the Company issued $50 million of convertible debentures with a five-year term, a 7.5% coupon and a conversion price of $1.55 per share. Proceeds were used to reduce bank debt and will provide financial flexibility for the Company’s 2011 capital program.
nATuRAL gAS MARKETS
In last year’s annual report, we characterized 2009 as a very challenging year for junior natural gas companies and natural gas markets. 2010 was no different. In 2010, the average price for natural gas at AECO was $4.00 per Mcf, compared to $3.95 per Mcf in 2009 and $8.13 per Mcf in 2008. The level of natural gas in storage in the united States continued to remain at very high levels throughout 2010 and into 2011. In January and February 2010, we saw a “normal” winter which prompted very good supply withdrawals for the heating season. This past summer was hot in eastern Canada and the eastern united States, which created strong demand for natural gas to generate electricity for air conditioning. However, the price of natural gas was suppressed due to increasing u.S. gas supply driven primarily by the u.S. shale gas plays. The large amount of gas in storage, combined with strong u.S. gas production and financial market fears, has suppressed the price of natural gas. The future price for natural gas is at a level that should not support most drilling projects on either side of the border. However, drilling continues in u.S. shale gas plays, partly due to lease retention and partly due to the large number of u.S. shale gas joint venture projects, where third parties are obligated to drill to earn lands owned by u.S. shale gas producers. In Canada, drilling continues primarily in areas where the gas target is liquids rich.
The best cure for low natural gas prices is periods of low natural gas prices, where ultimately drilling rig counts fall to the point where supply and demand become more balanced. natural gas is still a cyclical commodity. When the markets start to believe that supply and demand are more balanced, natural gas prices should strengthen. However, from our shareholders’ perspective, we cannot wait for the return of stronger natural gas prices. We were successful in the winter of 2009/2010 in reducing both capital and operating costs in our natural gas business; however, the cash flow coming from our natural gas business was not enough in a low natural gas price environment to sustain the Company’s drilling plans. In a higher natural gas price market, the Company has a sizeable natural gas asset base and drilling prospects that can generate considerable production growth. However, for now, our solution to low natural gas prices is to drill for light oil in the Cardium horizontal play.

CRuDE OIL MARKETS
Crude oil prices strengthened considerably in 2010, with the average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price in Canadian dollars being $82 per bbl as compared to $70 per bbl in 2009. WTI oil prices in Canadian dollars year to date in 2011 have been even higher with the recent political unrest in the Middle East. Future strip prices for the balance of 2011 are over $100 per bbl. We expect oil prices to remain high but to continue to be volatile, as crude oil remains a geopolitical commodity. On a relative basis, the difference between the Company’s realized field oil price and wellhead natural gas price is currently 25:1 as compared to the commonly used energy equivalency ratio of 6:1.
THE CARDIuM HORIZOnTAL OIL PLAY
The Company’s initial land position in the Cardium horizontal oil play was primarily acquired in a 2007 property acquisition, where the Company bought high quality deeper producing rights along with shallower Edmonton Sands rights and key facility infrastructure. Initially the Company successfully developed the deep liquids rich natural gas prospects at Westpem, Bigoray and Willesden green, as well as the Edmonton Sands shallow potential in these lands. It is now developing the Cardium oil prospects.
In late 2009, the industry aggressively started to acquire land and drill horizontal light oil wells in the Cardium. The Company reassigned one of its most senior geologists (who had previous Cardium experience) away from the shallow gas operations to focus on analyzing the Cardium. A lot of time was spent analyzing cores at the Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB) core storage facility. The conclusions were that the Company’s land was well positioned geologically to drill Cardium horizontal wells. Initial concerns with the play were focussed on geological risk, drilling and completion risk and cost control.
The Company believed that with the significant well and core control, geological risk could be managed. Outside consultants were hired to acquire horizontal drilling and multi-stage frac completion technologies. The Company operated the drilling of two wells and participated in another well in the first quarter of 2010 and completed them in the second quarter of 2010. Initial completion results were encouraging. The Company was one of the early adopters of monobore drilling technology, which is now the industry standard. After drilling 22 wells in 2010, the drilling risk in this play is minimal and controllable.
On the well completion front, consistent with other operators in the play, the initial multi- stage fracture stimulations were done using diesel, and then later using synthetic oil as the frac fluid. Today, as part of a general shift up the learning curve, water is used as the frac fluid for several key reasons:
– The stimulation cost is reduced by approximately $500,000 when compared to using a hydrocarbon based frac fluid;
– The cycle time to get new oil on stream is reduced significantly. With a water based frac, the first oil to surface is new oil and typically occurs three to four days after the frac stimulation has been completed. With a hydrocarbon based frac, all the hydrocarbon (diesel or synthetic oil, called load fluid) that was put down the wellbore when conducting the fracture stimulation must be recovered at surface before incremental volumes are deemed new oil. This load fluid recovery process can take three to four weeks;
– Water is a superior frac fluid to hydrocarbon based fluids in terms of its density and compressibility / shear properties; and
– Initial concerns that the introduction of water into the highly oil saturated Cardium reservoir would result in a reduction of permeability and hence poor post stimulation production performance have proven to be unfounded.

It is the Company’s view that the multi-stage fracture stimulation process is what carries the most risk in the play. Some of the early wells were not effectively stimulated along the whole horizontal length due to difficulties in shifting open some of the frac ports. The Company has successfully made a number of changes to date to mitigate this risk.
Since the play inception, the Company has reduced the costs of the play from $3.5 million per well to $3.0 million per well for full cycle drill, complete, equip and tie-in costs.
As we accomplished in the Edmonton Sands shallow gas business, our objective with this play is to be an industry leader in capital costs and build our own infrastructure to reduce operating expenses, improve operating margins and deliver strong recycle ratios.
Anderson has 112.5 gross (65.8 net) sections of Cardium prospective land and, based on a drilling density of three wells per section, could have 338 gross (197.4 net) drilling locations. The Company has high-graded this list of locations to a non-contingent development drilling list of 183 gross (111.2 net) locations. As of March 25, 2011, the Company has drilled 37 gross (26.7 net) wells, leaving a remaining non-contingent development drilling inventory of 146 gross (84.5 net) wells. The Company continues to add to its land position with farm-in deals, property swaps and acquisitions.

 The Company has created core areas in garrington, Pembina East and Willesden green and is developing a new core area in Ferrier. In each core area, the Company builds central tank batteries and pipelines to these facilities. Where possible, tank batteries are connected to oil pipeline systems for transportation to market. The Company consolidates its position in each area through land deals, and once battery infrastructure is in place, infill drilling can commence. ultimately, waterflooding could significantly improve recovery rates in the Cardium, and the Company plans to pursue this further in 2012.
In the past 12 months of operating in this play, the Company has learned some valuable lessons:
– The longer the horizontal well, the better the well, as long as the well is in good quality rock with sufficient net pay and permeability;
– Well performance is independent of wellbore orientation. Theoretically, the best wells should be positioned northwest to southeast. However, it is more important to position the well to intersect the thickest oil pay and best permeability;
– geology is more important than geography;
– It is important to locate the wells away from areas of significant pressure depletion from existing mature vertically drilled Cardium fields; and
– Oil recovery is higher in under-saturated oil reservoirs (lower gas oil ratio), than in saturated reservoirs (higher gas oil ratios below bubble point pressure/gas caps).
For example, initial production data can be misleading. The table on the following page describes two Company-operated wells. The 5-25 well is a saturated reservoir and the 5-24 well is an under-saturated reservoir. Although the 5-25 well had excellent initial production data with high gas oil ratios, its oil reserves on a proved plus probable basis are less than half of the 5-24 well.

2011 CAPITAL BuDgET
The Company is planning to direct almost all of its 2011 capital program to Cardium oil horizontal drilling. Anderson’s Board of Directors has approved a capital budget (net of dispositions) of $75 million for 2011. The associated production guidance for 2011 is approximately 7,500 BOED (net of dispositions), of which 33% is oil and ngLs, up from 18% oil and ngLs in 2010. The Company is estimating it could potentially exit 2011 with 40% to 50% of its production being oil and ngLs. The Company considered alternative spending plans that yielded higher BOED production growth through spending on natural gas prospects, but elected to proceed with the oil focused capital budget as it yields higher cash flows through stronger oil netbacks. The Company is not planning to spend any capital on its natural gas properties in 2011 and therefore estimates that production from its gas and ngL properties will fall at an annual decline rate of approximately 25%. The Company believes that in the current commodity price environment with future strip pricing of greater than $100 per barrel WTI for oil and less than $4.00 per gJ AECO for gas, a capital program focused primarily on Cardium horizontal oil is prudent. At WTI oil prices of $100 u.S. per barrel, the operating netback for Cardium light oil projects is currently about $75 per BOE, compared to the operating netback for Edmonton Sands shallow gas projects of about $15 per BOE. Based on current strip pricing, the Company’s 2011 cash flow is estimated to be approximately 50% higher than its 2010 cash flow.
The budget includes the drilling of 32 gross (22.0 net capital, 20.0 net revenue) Cardium horizontal oil wells in 2011, of which 15 gross (13.6 net capital, 11.3 net revenue) wells are planned to be drilled in the first quarter. The Cardium drilling program in the first quarter of 2011 is designed to add significant oil volumes by the second quarter. We plan to have a total of 41 gross (29.8 net) Cardium horizontal oil wells on production before the end of the second quarter of 2011. The Company continues to review the commodity price outlook and could potentially add to its 2011 drilling program with additional Cardium oil horizontal drilling locations.

   Reserves related to the Cardium horizontal oil play made up 14.8% of total proved plus probable reserves at December 31, 2010, compared to 1.4% at December 31, 2009. The percentage of total reserves from oil and ngL increased to 21% at December 31, 2010, from 11% at December 31, 2009. The Company has 98,813 gross (47,300 net) undeveloped acres of land excluding Cardium prospective lands as at December 31, 2010, and has assigned a value of $5.0 million to this land. The Company has assigned a value of $3.0 million per net section for Cardium lands that were not assigned drilling locations in the gLJ reserves report. These locations have not been included in the reserve report as they do not yet meet the criteria for recognition established under nI 51-101, either because there was insufficient production or horizontal well control to book the reserves, or the land deals were completed after December 31, 2010. The Company’s engineers have estimated the potential net present value of an average unbooked Cardium location to be approximately $2.2 million per location, using gLJ’s price forecast, a 10% pretax discount rate, farm-in and straight up economics over a four year time span of drilling activity. The Company has an inventory of 74.7 net Cardium locations not booked in the gLJ reserves report. The net asset value calculation also assumes that in-the-money stock options are exercised and convertible debentures are converted to common shares at $1.55 per share. Outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis are adjusted accordingly.
(1) The net asset valuation shows what the Company’s reserves would be produced at using forecast prices and costs. The value is a snapshot in time and is based on various assumptions, including commodity prices that vary over time. It should not be assumed that net asset value represents fair value of Anderson Energy shares.

OuTLOOK
The Company’s increasing oil production is expected to start improving operating netbacks and cash flow in 2011. As a result, the performance of the stock should also start to improve as the “gas label” starts to peel off the stock. Junior oil companies trade at better evaluation metrics than natural gas companies, and management believes that as we progress through 2011, we will start to attract more of a junior oil company evaluation. In 2010, 18% of the Company’s production came from oil and ngL. Our current estimate for 2011 is 33%. The Company is striving to be 40 to 50% oil and ngL by late 2011 or early 2012. The Company was able to move up the learning curve in 2010 and in the first quarter of 2011 with its drilling, completion and production initiatives. Currently, the Company is one of the industry leaders in terms of low capital costs. The Company is very focused on increasing its land position in the Cardium and utilizing new technologies to lower costs and enhance well performance. The addition of water based fracture stimulation in February 2011 is one example of new initiatives. The convertible debenture financing conducted in December 2010 gives the Company the financial flexibility to possibly expand its initial 2011 capital program beyond $75 million. In the second quarter of 2011, the Company will review the potential for budget and guidance expansion.
