   Dear Fellow Shareholders,
It is my pleasure to report that Glatfelter delivered
a solid year in 2016, achieving substantial operating improvements across the company and producing 3% earnings growth. Throughout the year, Glatfelter PEOPLE maintained a sharp focus on operational excellence, continuous improvement, and value creation to overcome significant market challenges.
We conducted business in a slow-growth global economy and faced overcapacity and intensifying competition
in some of our key markets. Despite these headwinds, Glatfelter made significant progress toward fulfilling
our vision of becoming the global supplier of choice in specialty papers and engineered materials.
• Advanced Airlaid Materials continued its growth with record operating profit climbing 24% over 2015.
Our exciting new specialty wipes product line experienced a 12% sales increase. Continuous improvement initiatives propelled the Canadian mill to record production. Construction of the new facility in Arkansas, which
will significantly expand the business unit’s capacity, is proceeding on budget and on time for completion in
late 2017.
• Specialty Papers improved operations and achieved record pulp production. Operating profit grew 25% over the previous year, and the business unit outperformed the uncoated free sheet market for the 12th year in a row.
• Composite Fibers was adversely impacted by lower selling prices, customer inventory reductions, and geopolitical disruptions. These combined to create a difficult market environment that depressed operating profits. Despite these headwinds, the business unit improved productivity and drove strong growth in attractive market niches such as technical specialties and composite laminates, delivering 16% EBITDA margins.
• The multi-year environmental compliance projects in Specialty Papers were completed on schedule – enabling us to meet new Clean Air Act regulations while substantially reducing Glatfelter’s carbon footprint.

• A strong safety effort drove the majority of our facilities to achieve industry top quartile performance. We are striving to become a safety leader and achieve our goal of working injury-free, every day.
Glatfelter introduced exciting new products, leveraged our market-leading positions, and conducted an aggressive continuous improvement effort that generated $23 million in cost savings. The result was an improvement in our financial performance.
• Adjusted earnings grew 3% to $1.38 per share.
• Glatfelter’s share price rose 29.6% versus 2015.
• We increased the dividend by 4%, the fourth consecutive year we have done so.
While capital expenditures of $160 million reduced cash flows, our balance sheet maintained the flexibility and strength to continue to execute our growth strategy.

   LOOKING AHEAD
As we chart the course for 2017 and beyond, Glatfelter will pursue a dual track execution plan.
The first track ensures we build a competitive cost structure while maintaining our leading market positions. Glatfelter will proactively manage cost and continuous improvement to mitigate the impact of market overcapacity and lower selling prices. For example, Composite Fibers will implement a cost optimization program in 2017 that will save $10 million. In addition, aggressive new product development for both the industrial market, such as electrical papers, and the consumer sector, such as dispersible wipes and inkjet papers, will help drive growth.
The second track involves investment for growth. While we anticipate a return to growth in Composite Fibers and continued growth in Advanced Airlaid Materials, we are exploring strategic acquisitions. Our primary focus is in adjacent product sectors that leverage our existing capabilities, increase our exposure to global megatrends, and provide access to higher-growth markets. Opportunities that meet these criteria are being evaluated in the hygiene and personal care, electrical and energy storage, and filtration sectors, among others.
Glatfelter also is making internal investments that will expand our participation in rapidly growing markets. For example, when the Arkansas facility enters production
in early 2018, it will add 22,000 tons of capacity to our personal care product lines. And customer commitments for a majority of this capacity are already in place.
We expect 2017 will bring increased volumes at our Advanced Airlaid Materials and Composite Fibers business units as we leverage our leading market positions and expand our product offerings, and Specialty Papers is positioned to again outperform the uncoated free sheet market. We will drive hard to implement our continuous improvement and cost reduction initiatives to combat the sluggish economic environment, excess capacity in key markets, and currency translation impact that will create some headwinds for the business.
CLOSING THOUGHTS
The coming year will be a critical transition period as Glatfelter prepares for an exciting new cycle of growth. In 2018 and 2019, we anticipate:
• The Arkansas facility will augment an exciting segment of our engineered materials business and begin generating operating profits
• Capital spending will recede to more normalized levels, restoring cash flows and strengthening our balance sheet
• Continuous improvement initiatives will provide a more competitive cost structure
• Continuing investments in our people and processes will improve asset reliability, productivity and organizational efficiency
• An expanded engineered products platform will address growing niche markets
• And the business cycle may begin to rebound, increasing demand for our high-value products
By focusing our efforts on flawless execution, targeted growth investment, and a superior customer experience, I am confident we will succeed in building the premier engineered materials company.
I want to thank all company shareholders for their support, loyalty, and patience. Much progress was achieved during the year – and more work remains to be done. We firmly believe that Glatfelter’s greatest accomplishments are yet to come.
Sincerely,
Dante C. Parrini
