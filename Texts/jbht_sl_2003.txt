 LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
2003 was a high-water mark in our return to respectable profit margins. Some of you who are relatively new to the J.B. Hunt Transport Services family may not know that in our first four years as a public company (1983-1986) we posted operating ratios of 78.6%, 75.9%, 79.7% and 77.1%, respectively. During that same time period, we also tripled in size from $63 million in revenue to $203 million. While it was another time and we were considerably smaller, we believe the same elements of excellence and execution apply today.
Our goals, while not based upon a return to operating ratios in the 70% range, are to challenge our peers for excellence in SAFETY, operations and profitability. We are proud of our team for making progress toward achieving a reasonable margin of profitability given our $2.4 billion in revenue. Most importantly, we not only improved the bottom line, but we gave our customers best-in-class service while keeping SAFETY first in our thoughts and actions. As a result, we had one of our safest years in history. Safe operations not only contribute to the bottom line but also signify our success in guarding the motoring public and our own drivers from accidents and injury.
Total operating revenue for the year was $2.43 billion, compared with $2.25 billion in 2002. While the economy and level of freight activity were uninspiring during 2003, we are extremely pleased to report the following improvements in operating income and net earnings for the year:
¥ Operating income rose 84% from $101 million in 2002 to $186 million in 2003 on an 8% rise in revenues.
¥ Net earnings for 2003 were $95.5 million, after reversing expected non-cash tax benefits of $7.7 million from the current year, resulting from a sale-and-leaseback transaction on containers. Comparatively, our 2002 earnings, which held the previous record,
were $51.8 million.
¥ Diluted earnings per share for 2003 (after the income-tax charge) were $1.17, also a record number, compared with 2002
full-year earnings of 66 cents per diluted share.
Earnings would have been $103.2 million and $1.26 per diluted share had the charge for taxes not been taken. As we have previously disclosed, the IRS has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with the sale-and-leaseback transactions. We continue to believe the transactions conform to applicable tax laws, and we intend to vigorously defend against the IRS position using all administrative and legal processes available and are optimistic we will prevail. However, the applicable accounting literature dictated that we reverse all of the 2003 expected non-cash tax benefits of approximately $7.7 million and cease recognition of the resulting benefits until the issue is resolved. There is no impact on the benefits taken in prior years.
Earnings per share jumped 77% even after deducting $7.7 million in tax benefits (91% if the tax charge had not been taken) in spite of a nearly 5% increase in average shares outstanding. The overall operating ratio for the company improved 310 basis points to 92.4% compared with 95.5% in 2002. The improvement in profitability was evenly distributed among our three business segments as Truck improved 270 basis points to 94.1%, Intermodal improved 300 basis points to 90.3%, and Dedicated Contract Services (DCS) improved 360 basis points to 93.3%.
Clearly, though long in coming, we are delighted at the continued improvement in our profitability. While we have much more to do in attaining a margin that justifies the risk involved in our business, we are satisfied with the pace of the progress. The teamwork and dedication of almost 16,000 transportation professionals have brought us to this point. The unity of purpose is ingrained into our culture. We have all embraced a commitment to operating our company safely, while providing best-in-class service and reliability to our customers and performing all of our work efficiently and effectively.
The recognition by Forbes magazine as the best managed trucking company in their Platinum listing for 2003 belongs to the entire J.B. Hunt organization because it is truly a team effort and a reflection of their sacrifices and hard work. It is that dedication and singleness of purpose that gives us great confidence as we continue our quest for excellence and as we continue to move toward our initial goal of a 90% operating ratio for the company as a whole.
We sincerely appreciate your support.
