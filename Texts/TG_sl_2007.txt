Dear Shareholders,“Everything has its time.”I have struggled over the years with the taskof writing the annual report’s letter toshareholders. This year is no different. Earningswere okay, but far from great. Strategicprogress was achieved. Cash generation wasvery strong. The stock price fell (a lot), substantiallyoffsetting its appreciation in 2006. I’vehad some difficulty coming up with a themethat fits such a mixed bag of performance.There is a time to be boring.Tradition suggests the CEO should commenton financial performance and strategic milestones.To some extent, this boils down to asummation of the detailed schedules includedin the 10-K and a review of press releases. SinceI am a traditionalist, I’ll do that, but as succinctlyas possible.The most significant strategic event since lastyear’s report actually occurred in 2008. For thelast several years our aluminum extrusion business(Bonnell) has struggled with the profitabilityof its Canadian operations (BonLCanada). Between January of 2003 and yearend2007 the Canadian dollar appreciatedapproximately 57 percent versus the U.S. dollar.Since most of BonL Canada’s sales were in U.S.dollars and our costs were in the stronger currency,profits were continuously squeezed.The recession that is continuing in the NorthAmerican aluminum extrusion industry madematters worse. We concluded that continuationin this market would not be rewarding.On February 12, 2008, Tredegar closed on thesale of this business. Transactions such as thischallenge an organization. The Bonnell andCorporate teams responded magnificently.We wish our Canadian brethren well andthank them for their significant efforts overthe years.The after tax cash proceeds from the sale ofBonL Canada are expected to be approximately$35 million. This cash will more than pay forthe planned expansion of our Carthage,Tennessee facility, which is focused onservicing the commercial construction market.Bonnell’s greatest strength resides in thissegment.The 2007 financial statements reflectcontinuing operations (i.e., BonL Canada hasbeen eliminated). Despite a nearly 16 percentdecline in aluminum extrusion volume and anapproximately 20 percent increase in averageglobal polyethylene resin prices since thefourth quarter of 2006, earnings per sharefrom continuingmanufacturing operationsincreased 6.5 percent. Our employees executedadmirably on strategic initiatives and costreductions. In addition, Film Products’ profitsfrom abroad benefited from currencyappreciation, and Tredegar had a $4.5 millionfavorable pretax swing in pension income.I find it difficult to conceive of a bad timeto generate cash.For those who are inclined to study financialmeasures, I commend to you an analysis of ourcash flow statement on page 43 in the 10-K.2007 was an extraordinary year for cash generation.To summarize, Tredegar’s modest netdebt increased by only $12 million after spending$74 million on stock repurchases (acquiringapproximately 12 percent of shares outstanding)and investing $23 million outside of manufacturing.This kind of cash generation beatsthe heck out of a sharp stick in the eye. Ouremployees’ focus on all components of cashwas rewarding.There is a time to be grateful.The most difficult challenge in writing anannual letter is balancing the message to adiverse audience. Most employees care aboutthe financial health of the company, but theyexpect, need and deserve clarity of vision,inspiration and a sense of how they fit into thecompany’s aspirations. This was a focal pointin last year’s letter.In 2007, our leaders responded to our chairman’scall to “integrate the company’s narrativewith that of the individual’s.” Numbersoften do not speak to an organization’s alignmentor commitment, but it is worth consideringthe human effort required to limit theerosion of operating profits to less than $2million when volumes fall off a cliff like theydid for Bonnell. Duncan Crowdis, president ofBonnell, and his team have instilled a pridefulenergy into the entire organization. Toughness,resiliency, and responsiveness are part of thefabric of the Bonnell story. I am very proud ofthe manner in which all Bonnell employeeshave responded to the challenges of 2007,particularly in controlling costs. Their characteris Bonnell.Nancy Taylor, president of Tredegar FilmProducts, and her team reinforce the vision of“innovation and quality at the right price.” Thisteam implemented a new organizationalstructure in 2007, which clarifies everyone’srole in realizing that vision. The board, shareholdersand I look to Films for a continuationof the growth we have seen since 2004. Thecombination of a slowing economy, increasedcompetitive activity and rapidly rising rawmaterial costs represent challenges in 2008. Iam optimistic that our people will rise to thechallenge of reducing costs while seizingopportunities. I am most encouraged by theenergy behind the drive to innovate, providesolutions for our customers and develop newproducts and technology platforms.Shareholders own and boards direct. Advice isoffered. Strategies are challenged. Performanceis reviewed. Some boards and owners aredirectly involved with shaping the vision andthus become part of the story.Employees live the story. They dedicate theirenergy to make the vision a reality. Strategyand execution matter most to them. Theircommitment goes beyond a meeting, a decimalpoint on a personal financial statement orconsideration of a buy or sell order. To allemployees, I am grateful for your efforts in 2007and welcome you to the continuing story ofleadership and excellence at Tredegar.There is a time for sober reflection.If earnings from continuing operations wereup, cash generation was excellent, and theorganization is heeding the call, then why wasthe stock down 29 percent in 2007? The shortanswer is: I don’t know. Since I don’t know, itdoesn’t make much sense to expound on myignorance; however, I will cite a few factors toconsider. Weakness in the aluminum extrusionmarket and the impact of higher resin pricesbecame increasingly evident as the year progressed.The outlook for residential constructionworsened throughout 2007. Concernsabout commercial construction markets areincreasing. The subprime credit crunch notonly exacerbated the concerns about constructionand the economy, but it dampenedvaluation multiples in our industries as privateequity firms reassessed their interest in businessesup for sale. As winter approached,some economists, many politicians, and mostof the news media decided we should havea full-fledged recession. All of this boils downto growing uncertainty about the outlookfor U.S. industrial firms, particularly thosetied to construction and fossil fuel basedraw materials.There is a time to look ahead.Tredegar has great strengths. Our Filmsbusiness has excellent technology, innovativepeople, a global position and enviablecustomer incumbencies. Bonnell is a provenleader in the U.S. aluminum extrusion businesswith great strengths in the commercialconstruction market, and an outstandinggroup of employees who have overcomeextraordinary challenges. These businessescontribute cash to a very healthy balancesheet. While capital spending slowed in 2007,we have ample opportunities to invest andgrow including the installation of a newextrusion press in Tennessee, global expansionin Films as well as broadening of technologyplatforms for protective film product lines.There is a time to recognize and welcome.To conclude, I would like to express myappreciation for the contribution of HorstAdam who will retire from the board in May.In 2005, our board’s Nominating and GovernanceCommittee asked Horst if he would be willingto endure three years of transcontinentalshuttles to help Tredegar focus on growth andhe has filled that role admirably. He has helpedthe leaders of Tredegar broaden their view ofopportunities. On behalf of the board, I wishHorst the very best and thank him for hiscontributions to our evolving story.George A. Newbill, former Executive VicePresident—Manufacturing Operations forAlbemarle Corporation will, upon a favorablevote by shareholders, join Tredegar’s board.George has led Albemarle to manufacturingexcellence according to every measure. I haveno doubt that his experience and insights willhelp Tredegar down the road of continuousimprovement.John D.
