To our Stockholders, In 2015, we completed the separation of PayPal from eBay Inc. and increased our efforts to innovate and grow our Marketplace, Classifieds and StubHub platforms. The business and financial achievements outlined in the CEO's letter underscore the progress the company has made to execute its strategic priorities during a year of significant change. As we set up the new eBay for success, we also established a best-in-class Board of Directors, adding six new directors -- Anthony Bates, Bonnie Hammer, Paul Pressler, Robert Swan, Perry Traquina and Devin Wenig. Collectively, these leaders bring significant management, technology, financial, retail and media experience to the eBay Board. Their skills and expertise, coupled with those of our existing Board members, lend the right level of stewardship to the company. Additionally, I was honored to assume the role of Chairman of the Board in 2015, succeeding the incomparable Pierre Omidyar, who remains a director of the Board. As eBay looks to complete its first full year as a standalone company, we believe our potential has never been greater. The Board believes deeply in eBay's purpose of creating economic opportunity for all, and we are confident that we have the right strategy in place to bring this vision to life. I look forward to being a part of eBay's bright future. Thank you, our stockholders, for your continued support and commitment to our company.

Thomas Tierney Chairman of the Board
