to our shareholders and friends:
What we want for Capital One
Capital One turned five in November, and in every year since its public offering, it has set financial records across the board. We are especially proud of consistently meeting two of our most ambitious annual goals, a 20%-plus increase in earnings per share and a 20%-plus return on equity. We have delivered both for five consecutive years, a record matched by only 10 of the country’s 10,000 public companies.
Other highlights:
• We started as a U.S. credit card company. We now have a growing international business. We also market auto loans, installment loans, deposit accounts, other con- sumer financial products and wireless phone service.
• In 1994, we had 5 million customers. Today we have 24 million, giving us one of the largest customer bases in the world and a large, ready-made market for our other products.
• We’re one of the fastest-growing financial service companies on the Internet.
Even after this high-velocity growth, we believe our opportunities are broader and brighter than ever. But what we want most for Capital One goes well beyond making the most of opportunities. We want to build one of the world’s truly great companies. That is the dream at the heart of all we do. We want Capital One to be great in every way that matters — great as a place to work, great at innovation and customer service, great as a financial performer and a corporate citizen. And we want this greatness to endure.

To ensure that it will, we often forgo short-run gains to achieve long-term success. Our marketing investment, which funds testing and product rollouts, is huge: the $732 million we invested in 1999 was 127% of our pretax earnings. Our capital base significantly exceeds the regulatory requirements for a “well-capitalized” financial institution.
As in the past, our growth will be driven by our information-based strategy (IBS), which we created 12 years ago. IBS links our database (one of the world’s largest) to prize-winning information technology and highly sophisticated analytics. With IBS we scientifically test ideas before taking them to market, and we tailor the product to the individual customer. Before IBS, issuers priced all cards at 19.8% and denied credit to applicants whose risk pro- files did not fit narrow parameters. The testing and customizing made possible with IBS have transformed the credit card industry by dramatically reducing credit costs for most con- sumers and by making credit cards available for the first time to millions of people.
IBS allows us to reach hard-to-find customers in thousands of “microsegments” and offer them innovative, high-value products tailored to their needs. We have built a thriving business in the superprime market — the country’s most blue-chip customers. We also successfully market to the needs and passions of sports fans, music lovers, newlyweds, new parents, and hundreds of other lifestyle and lifestage groups. And we market profitably to the underserved — customers traditionally overlooked by our competitors.
With IBS we can innovate constantly. And rapid, substantive innovation is essential to great- ness. The winners in an increasingly competitive world will be the companies that offer the best buys, offer them first and move on when competitors move in. Capital One’s innovation machine is running smoothly at very high speed: in 1999, we tested 36,114 new ideas, 25% more than in 1998.
IBS has generated consistently high returns for Capital One and has helped us maintain excel- lent credit quality. Our profitability in 1999 was one of the highest among major issuers, and our charge-off rate was the very lowest.
While we are enjoying explosive growth in the U.S. credit card business, we have also been successful in exporting IBS to other markets. We now operate in Canada and the United Kingdom and are actively testing in other countries. In addition, we continue to diversify beyond credit cards. Our 1998 acquisition of Summit Acceptance Corporation has given us a beachhead in auto finance, a market almost twice the size of the credit card business. Our installment loan business grew by 45% in 1999.

Profits from cross-selling have tripled in the last two years. In 1999, 57% of new customers bought at least one other product from us. The products we cross-sell are best in class. We don’t market a product until our associates try it and say they’re satisfied with it.
The magnitude of Capital One’s potential is best appreciated in the context of two of the biggest business revolutions of our time — direct marketing and the Internet. Capital One is at the forefront of both because it excels at data mining, testing, customizing and innovat- ing. Financial services are ideal for direct marketing, and customer interactions produce an endless stream of information for research and development.
On the Internet, IBS works at unprecedented speeds. Testing and customizing happen in real time. Approvals take less than a minute instead of a week. Account numbers are assigned with approvals, so customers can use their cards online immediately. We’re a leader in online credit cards. The Internet also expands opportunities for account servicing and cross-selling, and it opens the way for new online products and services. As we move into these new areas, we remain deeply committed to protecting the privacy of customer information on the Internet, in our database and throughout our marketing and customer service operations.
Knowing that there are no great companies without great people, we make recruiting our top priority. The people we attract are talented, entrepreneurial individuals with big dreams of their own. They come for the big opportunities they see in a high-growth company with a cul- ture that prizes performance more than time and grade. Capital One’s 15,500 associates are first-rate at work and in their communities, where they volunteer their creativity, energy and time. These contributions, plus financial support from Capital One, are making a difference in countless nonprofit programs, especially for children and families at risk.
For five years, Capital One has created great opportunities for associates, great products for customers and great returns for investors. We expect the next five years to be just as excit- ing. We have a winning strategy as well as the market power and the momentum for continued strong growth. Most important, we have the people who can help us realize our dream of great- ness. It has been said that you can tell a lot about people by the company they keep. We agree. We’re proud to be judged by the company we keep. We invite you to join us in pursuing our dream.
