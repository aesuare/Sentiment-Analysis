 KINDRED HEALTHCARE’S MISSION
is to promote healing, provide hope, preserve dignity and produce value for each patient, resident, family member, customer, employee and shareholder we serve.
 Dear Shareholders,
Nearly eight years ago, Kindred Healthcare emerged from bankruptcy protection in great part thanks to the hard work, dedication and leadership of Eddie Kuntz, our Chairman, our management team and the unwavering support of our Board. Today we celebrate Kindred Healthcare being ranked first in Fortune magazine’s list of Most Admired Companies among Health Care: Medical Facilities. The participants in Fortune magazine’s survey of Most Admired Companies ranked us not only Number 1 among our peers, but Number 1 in people management, use of corporate assets, financial soundness and social responsibility. Since beginning this journey, we have made significant progress in a number of areas:
• Employee turnover is down company wide from 81% in 2001 to 38% in 2008.
• The quality of services in our nursing and rehabilitation centers has significantly improved and we have received more Quality Awards from the American Health Care Association (“AHCA”) than any other provider in the country.
• Our hospitals successfully worked through several years of significant regulatory changes. Through these difficult times, we continued to improve our clinical outcomes, exceeding national benchmarks, and mitigated much of the financial impact of the reimbursement changes.
• Peoplefirst Rehabilitation was established as a separate division in 2004, and has grown from $228 million in revenues to $427 million last year with operating income of $38 million.
• And, in July 2007 we successfully spun-off our institutional pharmacy business in a tax-free transaction to shareholders creating PharMerica Corporation (“PharMerica”), now a Fortune 1,000 company with almost $2 billion in annual revenues.
Progress in 2008
We continued to achieve success in 2008 on a number
of fronts despite a difficult economic environment. More importantly, fiscal 2008 provided further evidence to support our fundamental management philosophy: If we take care of our people, and focus on quality and customer service, our business results will follow.
Operational and financial highlights for the year include:
• Our employee turnover and retention rates improved in all three operating divisions;
• Quality and customer service metrics continued to improve across all divisions. In our Health Services Division, we improved our federal and state survey results, showed improvements in recognized quality indicators, and 51 of our nursing and rehabilitation centers received AHCA Quality Awards. In our Hospital Division, our vent pneumonia
and blood stream infection rates continued to exceed national benchmarks. And in Peoplefirst Rehabilitation, our therapists achieved additional improvements in the functional outcomes of over 115,000 patients discharged from our care.
• We reported solid revenue gains in each of our three operating divisions in 2008. Excluding our former pharmacy division that was spun-off in July 2007, our consolidated 2008 revenues of $4.2 billion grew a solid 8%;
• Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations totaled $1.51, significantly better than our expectations at the beginning of the year;
• Routine, information technology, facility modernization and hospital development capital spending totaled $149 million in 2008, all of which was financed through internal sources;
• Operating cash flows for 2008 grew 12% to $183 million;
• Cash levels at December 31, 2008 increased to $141 million, and together with the remaining unborrowed capacity under
 
 our revolving credit facility of $151 million at the end of the year, provides significant financial flexibility in a difficult credit environment. The credit facility, with its favorable pricing, financial covenants and other terms, is scheduled to expire in July 2012.
In our Hospital Division, thanks to our continued efforts to educate referral sources on the quality, clinical capabilities and cost effectiveness of our services, we increased our admissions significantly, particularly our managed care business. Despite the positive admissions growth, declining length of stay, cost management issues and weakness in certain newer facilities negatively impacted our hospital operating results for 2008. As we move into 2009, we have renewed our efforts to better control variable costs and are leveraging our management resources to improve the operations of our underperforming hospitals.
In our Health Services Division, stable reimbursement rates, growth in managed care and Medicare admissions, and quality- driven reductions in professional liability costs resulted in strong financial performance. Our investments in staffing, training and the modernization of our physical plants are also paying off, as we continue to enhance our capabilities to serve short-stay rehabilitation patients and higher acuity longer term residents. Our overall admissions growth was strong in 2008, which improved our occupancy to 89% from 87.8% in 2007.
Peoplefirst Rehabilitation continued its growth beyond the Kindred portfolio of hospitals and nursing centers by signing 67 new contracts with non-affiliated customers. In 2008, approximately 37% of our Peoplefirst revenues were derived from non-affiliated customers, up from 32% in 2007. Further growth in volumes and revenues helped to offset declines in our operating margins from wage rate pressures associated with a competitive marketplace for therapists and the start-up costs associated with non-affiliated customer contract growth.
We also have made great progress over the past few years in the recruitment, retention and development of our people. Our commitment to our employees is the key driver of our ongoing efforts to improve our clinical outcomes and customer service. Our investments in employee orientation, continuing clinical education, leadership development and employee recognition programs have helped to make Kindred an employer of choice in many of our local markets.
As a provider of healthcare services, we also are committed to providing cost-effective, quality patient care. For example, we recently renegotiated our pharmacy services agreement
with PharMerica resulting in anticipated cost reductions
of approximately $10 million per year during 2009 and 2010, and saw continued improvement in our professional liability underwriting results, reducing aggregate expenses by approximately $3 million from 2007.
Despite the turmoil in the financial markets, we remain committed to growing and repositioning our operations and believe further opportunities exist for the expansion of our services. During 2008, we continued to execute our strategic development plan as reflected by the following:
• We opened a new hospital with 70 licensed beds;
• We have five hospitals containing 208 licensed beds currently under development, one of which will become operational in 2009 and the remainder in 2010; and
• We further repositioned our hospital portfolio by divesting three underperforming long-term acute care hospitals.
We expect that the general economic environment will be difficult in 2009. We also anticipate that healthcare reform will be a central focus of lawmakers at both the federal and state levels. As the largest diversified provider of post-acute care services in the United States, we believe that Kindred, and other post-acute providers, will be an important part of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our nation’s healthcare delivery system and we welcome your insights as we prepare to engage in this ongoing policy process.
Our focus on the quality of care provided to our patients and residents, our commitment to taking care of our employees, and our efforts to effectively use and preserve our capital resources have positioned us well for the future.
Finally, the work performed on a daily basis by our 53,700 dedicated employees will continue to drive our success and create value for our patients, residents and shareholders. On behalf of them, and on behalf of our Board of Directors, we thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Paul J. Diaz
President and Chief Executive Officer
