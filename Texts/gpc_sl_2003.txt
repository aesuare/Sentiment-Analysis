TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
We are pleased to have the opportunity to give you our thoughts and comments on the year 2003 for Genuine Parts Company and what we see ahead for 2004. Total sales for 2003 reached $8.45 billion, an increase of 2% and a new record level for us exceeding our previous high set in the year 2000.
Net earnings of $353.6 million before an accounting change were down 4% compared to 2002 and earnings per share before the effect of a change in accounting principle in 2003 and 2002, were $2.03 compared to $2.10, respectively. We are disappointed that earnings before the cumulative effect adjustments were not on the plus side given our sales improvement. While we were able to do a commendable job of expense control, our gross profit margins before the reclassification of vendor consideration, were below those of the previous year and negatively impacted our earnings picture. There are a number of actions we can take to improve margins for 2004 and this is certainly a priority for our entire GPC Management Team.
2004 to an annual rate of $1.20 per share. The new cash dividend represents 59% of our 2003 earnings before the effect of a change in accounting principle and becomes our 48th consecutive year of dividend increases.
MANAGEMENT
In June 2003, Robert L. Fitts, Chairman of S.P. Richards Company, retired after 29 years of service with the Company. Bob joined Motion Industries in 1974 and was promoted through several sig- nificant positions there, moving to S.P. Richards in 1985. Bob led our Office Products segment through a period of excellent growth in both sales and earnings and provided splendid leadership to the S.P.R. team. Our thanks and best wishes to Bob as he looks ahead. Following Bob's retirement at S.P. Richards, C. Wayne Beacham has been named Chairman in addition to his title of Chief Executive Officer, and Paul D. Donahue was named President and Chief
  WE WERE ENCOURAGED WITH OUR SALES PICTURE EARLY IN THE YEAR, EXPERIENCED A SLOWING IN QUARTERS TWO AND THREE AND THEN A STRENGTHENING IN THE FINAL QUARTER WITH SALES IMPROVING BY 5%. WE ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT THIS STRONGER SALES TREND WILL CARRY OVER INTO 2004.
As you may recall, there have been a number of accounting changes coming forward from the Financial Accounting Standards Board in recent times. Effective January 1, 2003, all companies including GPC were required to adopt the Financial Accounting Standards Board's EITF 02-16 affecting the accounting treatment of cash consideration received from vendors. As a result of EITF 02-16, a non-cash charge of $20 million was recorded as of January 1, 2003 representing the cumulative effect of a change in account- ing principle. It is important to note that these changes have no impact on our operating results and no cash implications for us.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH
The Company’s balance sheet remains strong and our financial condition is excellent. Our ratio of current assets to current liabili- ties was 3.4/1 at year-end, a slight increase over the previous year, and we continued to generate strong cash flow, with approxi- mately $402 million in cash flow from operations for 2003. We used cash during the year to invest $74 million in necessary capital expenditures for our businesses and reduced total debt by approx- imately $114 million. This represents the second consecutive year of significant debt reduction for us, and our total debt to total capitalization ratio moved down to 23% from 27% in 2002.
The Company also purchased approximately 600,000 shares of our Company stock during 2003, as part of our gradual share repurchase plan and we currently have an additional 6.6 million shares authorized for repurchase. We will continue to use available cash flow to further reduce our debt levels and remain active in our share repurchase plan for 2004.
DIVIDENDS
The Company has paid a dividend every year since going public in 1948 and the $1.18 per share dividend paid in 2003 was our 47th consecutive year of dividend increases. We are pleased to report that on February 16, 2004, the Board of Directors continued this significant tradition by increasing the cash dividend payable April 1,

DEVELOPMENTS IN OPERATIONS
The Automotive Group produced a 3% sales increase for the year, showing improvement in each period, and a strong finish in the final quarter. In our third quarter comments we reported to you that we were near the completion of our acquisition of NAPA Hawaii and we were pleased to accomplish this on October 31st. Their annual revenues are approximately $35 million and their results since completing the acquisition have been very encouraging. We believe that positive industry trends in the automotive after- market combined with our growth initiatives and strengthened management team position our Automotive segment for a higher level of sales tempo in 2004.
Sales for the Industrial Products Group began to slip after a moderate increase in the first quarter and were down in the second and third quarters compared to 2002. In the fourth quarter, this segment managed to rebound with a 2% sales increase. We believe that Motion has maintained or even improved market share during the soft period for the manufacturing sector in the U.S. for many months now. We see indications of improvement occurring gradually with Motion’s customer base and expect this to impact Motion in a positive way for 2004. EIS, our Electrical/Electronic segment, finished the year with a modest sales increase in the final quarter, their first increase in quite some time. Much like Motion, we are encouraged by the improving trends we see at EIS.
The Office Products Group led all our businesses in sales growth
in 2003 with solid increases in each period and up 4% for the year. S.P. Richards also increased their operating profits, despite margin pressures associated with competitive pricing issues and a slight shift in product mix to lower margin products. We anticipate their growth to continue in the 4% to 5% range for 2004.
LOOKING AHEAD
We are fortunate that the industries we serve provide Genuine Parts Company with large and fragmented markets offering sub- stantial growth potential. With this said, we recognize the need to pick up the pace with our strategies and execution particularly in our large Automotive and Industrial markets. GPC is in a position of market leadership in all our businesses but we enter this year with a determination and explicit plans to reach a higher level of growth. Many of these ideas and plans are expressed in the pages in the Annual Report covering all four business segments and we hope you will take a look at them.
We thank each shareholder, as well as our employees, suppliers, and especially our customers for your valuable support and we will be pushing hard for a year in 2004 that we can all be proud of.
Respectfully submitted,
Larry L. Prince Chairman of the Board
