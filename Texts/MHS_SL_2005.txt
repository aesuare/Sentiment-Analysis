To our shareholders, clients, and employees:

By any measure, 2005 was a year in which Medco continued to deliver on its commitment to enhance the value we offer to our customers, members, patients, and, in turn, our shareholders.
We grew as a business, winning in the marketplace. We also demonstrated a sense of social responsibility on a global level. Among our significant 2005 accomplishments, Medco:
Won new business: Annualized new sales surpassed $3 billion. Retained existing business: Renewed business totaling $10 billion annually. Acquired high-growth business: The acquisition of Accredo Health,
David B. Snow, Jr. Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

Incorporated created the largest specialty pharmacy in the country with $4.9 billion in annualized sales in the fastest-growing area of prescription healthcare. Launched a new product line: We developed and implemented a nationwide Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program and were named by the government as one of only 10 national Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) to service the Medicare-eligible population. Drove generic adoption: Generic dispensing rates grew to 51.5 percent, an increase of 5.2 percentage points from the prior year. As we executed on our strategy with a combination of technology-driven innovation and market-focused insight, Medco in 2005 continued to deliver strong financial results:
Delivering 2005 net income of $602 million, a year-over-year increase of 25 percent, on record revenues of $37.9 billion. Surpassing our EPS goals, generating full-year GAAP diluted EPS of $2.05,

an increase of 17.1 percent from 2004.
Generating cash flows from operations of more than $1 billion in 2005.

Increasing shareholder value, ending the year with stock appreciation of 34.1 percent -- a return of 134 percent since the company was taken public in

August 2003. Medco market capitalization grew 48.6 percent, to $17.0 billion, up from $11.4 billion at year-end 2004. Medco's strong financial performance provided the flexibility to respond to a marketplace that is dynamic and competitive, as well as the wherewithal to return value to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. In August we implemented an initial $500 million stock repurchase program, with an incremental $1 billion approved in December. By year-end we had repurchased 7.7 million shares at an approximate total cost of $407 million.

$31 billion
in client renewals over the past 2 years. This unprecedented amount of renewals allows us more focus on winning new business and developing new solutions for our clients.

Winning in the marketplace
When clients choose Medco, it's more than just good business -- it's personal. We work with clients to lower costs and raise the standards for quality prescription healthcare. It's the basis for a lasting relationship. In addition to the new business we won in 2005, we accelerated our momentum, entering the 2006 sales year with an additional $2.7 billion in annualized new business to date, placing the company in a net-new sales position of $700 million, to date, for 2006. We achieved these business results by developing a corporate culture that maintains an uncompromising focus on our clients and members. Ranked No. 48 in the Fortune 500, Medco in 2005 achieved standing as one of Fortune magazine's Most Admired companies, and received the highest ranking of any pharmacy benefit manager. In 2005 we were rated No. 1 for a fifth straight year in the competitive WilsonRx Pharmacy Survey of customer satisfaction -- a distinction that no competitor in our industry has ever attained.

An affordable, accessible pharmacy benefit for all Americans
America's gold standard of pharmacy care must be both affordable and accessible. Medco continues to invest in programs and services that are designed to ensure that high-quality care is available to larger numbers of people -- by extending care to new, uncovered populations; encouraging the use of lower-cost therapies made available through more efficient channels; and leveraging technology systems to empower clients and members with information that enables informed healthcare decisions -- frequently referred to as consumer-driven products. The development, positioning, and implementation of a Medicare products suite was a highlight in our series of 2005 accomplishments. Medco's PDP, YOURx PLANTM, was one of only 10 nationwide plans approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Medco was also selected to serve individuals automatically assigned to the program by the government in 19 out of 34 national CMS Medicare Part D regions.

For the past 7 years, Medco clients have experienced some of the lowest drug trend in the industry. Across our entire book of business, drug trend declined to a record-low 5.4 percent in 2005, driven downward in large part by Medco programs designed to increase utilization of generic medications and mail service.

By the end of 2005, 52 out of every 100 prescriptions managed by Medco were for generic medications. Over the next 5 years, generic drugs are expected to become available for more than 70 brand-name drugs, driving this money-saving trend even higher.

Response to Medco's Medicare products has been exceptional -- we retained 95 percent of the retirees enrolled through our pre-existing employer business and are on target with our initial enrollment expectations of 250,000 to 270,000 members by adding nearly 240,000 new YOURx PLAN members to date. In addition, more than 10 of our health plan clients elected to use Medco as the "PBM inside" of their plan. Medco estimates that the drug spend from these clients along with Medco's YOURx PLAN will represent more than 9 percent of the projected $124 billion in overall 2006 drug spend for U.S. Medicare-eligible retirees. As our clients increasingly provided incentives for their members to become more actively involved in economically advantaged choices, Medco's generic dispensing rate increased 5.2 points to 51.5 percent in 2005. Medco is already one of the nation's largest purchasers of generic medicines, and the increasing acceptance of generics reinforces our foundation for delivering even greater future savings as a new wave of generics hits the market -- $46 billion over the next 5 years. Generics, combined with increasing use of our advanced mail-order pharmacy services, provide a convergence of interests that delivers significant cost reduction for our clients, high-quality therapy and service for members, and greater profitability for Medco. In 2005 Medco dispensed 87.3 million prescriptions through its mail-order pharmacies compared to 87.7 million in the prior year, representing a 12.6 percent increase when excluding the 10.2 million prescriptions associated with the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan contract that expired in December 2004. As a result, drug trend -- the rate at which prescription drug spend grows each year -- dropped from 8.5 percent in 2004 to 5.4 percent in 2005 for Medco clients, its lowest level since this metric has been tracked. Indeed, some Medco clients that took full advantage of our plan design and management capabilities experienced reduction in their year-over-year drug spend.

Responding to new science
Today, the specialty pharmacy industry is a rapidly expanding market. Spending on biotech and specialty pharmaceuticals is increasing at twice the rate of that for traditional medications, and some specialty therapies can exceed a quarter of a million dollars per patient, per year. As the nation's largest specialty pharmacy operation by virtue of our Accredo acquisition, Medco has increased its specialty penetration by selling-in its specialty pharmacy services to clients representing more than 40 million eligible members. Medco expects $50 million in 2006 synergies from the integration of Accredo into our business. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings per share by $0.05 to $0.08 in 2006. Our approach aligns specialty pharmacy and leverages proven techniques that have decreased drug trend across traditional pharmacy benefits management programs -- leveraging the efficiencies of scale with our leading edge tools such as EXPERxT Advisor® and integrating medical data through RationalMed® to effect better overall health outcomes for patients. This improves safety and savings while offering a seamless continuum of care.

Doing well by doing good
Two events, the South Asian tsunami and Hurricane Katrina, were sudden and devastating. Each of us at Medco was saddened by the loss of life, suffering, and devastation, and collectively our response was swift and appropriately reflected the values that are at the core of our company. As part of the tsunami relief effort, we committed to a donation of more than 13 million doses of critically needed generic medications. In New Orleans and Texas, the passion and professionalism of our employees drove many to an even deeper level of commitment, staffing evacuee shelters and spending days in a quickly crafted mobile pharmacy -- in short, Medco people made a difference by offering their unique skills, expertise, and time. Each of these employees has my gratitude and admiration.

Client retention rate for 2005. High client retention reflects our commitment to service and value. Today, the average contract length across Medco's largest clients is an impressive 4.5 years.

Momentum and growth in 2006
As we reflect back on our success, we look forward to even greater opportunity in 2006. The historic wave of new generics coming to market enables us to help our clients manage the growing demand for pharmacy care. At the same time, our industry-leading specialty pharmacy operation will assist our clients in managing the high costs associated with today's biotech treatments. We are poised to deliver a record 91 million prescriptions through our mailorder pharmacies, widely regarded as the most sophisticated in our industry, and delivering the benefits of cost efficiency and clinical effectiveness. As 2006 begins, enrollment in our Medicare programs enables us to extend proven clinical and management capabilities to new sectors of the population. And Medco intends to assert its clinical leadership with broad-based implementation of our Therapeutic Resource Centers, launching what promises to become a new generation of pharmacy practice excellence. I invite you to read our annual report, which elaborates on the ways in which Medco continues to deliver more -- building value and recalibrating the standards for quality and savings in prescription healthcare.
