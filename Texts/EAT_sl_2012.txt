To Our Shareholders, Team Members, Guests, Franchise Partners and Supplier Partners:
Results. That's the promise Brinker leadership made to you, our shareholders, when we unveiled our `Plan to Win' two and a half years ago. We committed to measurable, tangible goals designed to move our company out of the casual dining sea of sameness and back into our rightful place as an industry leader. Milestones of our plan were aggressive, but attainable: 
-IMPROVING OPERATING MARGINS BY BASIS POINTS-RETURNING VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASE AND INCREASED DIVIDENDS RESULTING IN stock price appreciation 
-DOUBLING EARNINGS PER SHARE TO REACH $2.75 -$2.80 BY 2015 AND 
-SUSTAINED POSITIVE YEAR OVER YEAR SALES GROWTH 

And today, the entire Brinker organization ­ from hourly, management and restaurant support center team members to our valued domestic and global franchise partners, and the hundreds of suppliers who make it possible to run our restaurants every day ­ is working together to deliver on those promises. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2012, THE RESULTS ARE CLEAR 
-BRINKER CROSSED THE HALFWAY MARK TOWARD OUR GOAL IN 400BPS OF MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS
-OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN INCREASED 27% OVER FIsCAL YEAR 2011
-WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE DIVIDENDS AND DURING THE YEAR REPURCHASED 11 MILLION SHARES FOR $287 million, and 
-OUR STOCKHOLDERS ENJOYED A YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARECONCLUDING FISCAL 2012 AT $1.96 EARNINGS PER SHARE
 Even against the current economic backdrop of fluctuating unemployment rates and consumer spending headwinds, Brinker brands are continuing to deliver record results and gain market share from competitors across multiple categories. This year, we reported comparable restaurant sales for THE ENTIRE BRINKER SYSTEM WERE UP & OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS MARKED THE FIFTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF POSITIVE SAMESTORE SALES FOR CHILLI'S BAR AND 10th CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF POSITIVE SAME store sales for the Maggiano's Little Italy® brand.LOOKING FORWARD INTO FISCAL 2013,BRINKER AND OUR BRANDS REMAIN FOCUSED ON DELIVERING ON OUR promise to strengthen the company's overall business model with a balanced approach that will increase topline sales, improve operational efficiencies and increase value to you, our shareholders. And while our shareholder value driven by business results is paramount; it's not the only measure by which we evaluate new initiatives and investments prior to execution within our brands. To PRODUCE SUSTAINABLE RESULTS IN ALMOST 1,600 RESTAURANTS WORLDWIDEINITIATIVES MUST PROVIDE A WIN FOR all three parties involved--our team members, our guests and the company. In our business, there's always been a wrong way to get margins: by cheating the guests or by asking our team members to unduly sacrifice. When filtering our initiatives to ensure they contain `The Three Wins,' we improve margins and sales the RIGHT way--the way we are doing it within our two restaurant brands today.

Feedback from guests, team members and the marketplace
Whether they are dining with us at one of our exotic overseas locations or in a local neighborhood restaurant, from the moment a guest walks through our doors, we gain priceless feedback regarding their experience. More than one million guests dine with us every day, and each of their individual experiences shape their beliefs about our brand. We recognize the importance of actively listening to guest feedback regarding their restaurant experience. METRICS EVALUATED INCLUDE ATTENTIVENESS OF SERVICEQUALITY OF FOOD PACE OF MEAL DELIVERY AND restaurant management and appearance. Our survey provides the ultimate proving ground for whether the initiatives and `Big Rocks' we have implemented in our restaurants are delivering an improved experience for our guests. That's why it brings me great pride to share our brands' guest experience scores are the highest they have ever been since implementing the survey four years ago.
