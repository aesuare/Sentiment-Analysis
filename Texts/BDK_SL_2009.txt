Letter to Shareholders
Diversification, Operational Discipline, Agility
We have long believed that recessionary times present game-changing and transformational opportunities for companies that are strong enough to take advantage of them. Stanley experienced such a year in 2009. Our substantial cash flow, focus on cost reduction initiatives and pricing actions in 2009 enabled us to increase our earnings, achieve record gross margins of 40.4% and produce a best-in-class 7.9 working capital turns, all while dealing with a precipitous sales decline amidst the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression. It was our financial strength and our portfolio diversity that allowed us to pursue -- and recently close -- the most significant transaction in Stanley's history: our combination with Black & Decker. This combination is another important step in the transformation of our company, creating a global diversified industrial leader and a powerful engine for future growth. Stanley's accomplishments in 2009 were realized through methodical execution of all elements related to the Stanley Fulfillment System (SFS) -- our transformational business system focused on operational excellence and continuous improvement. We also benefited from the fact that we have some of the strongest brands in the world and deliver outstanding customer value propositions. For the full year, we generated approximately $450 million in free cash flow (refer to page 6), an increase of approximately $25 million over 2008 levels, and our second-best year ever. More than $220 million of this free cash was due to our management of working capital, which underscores the benefits from our successful deployment of SFS. Strong free cash flows allow us to pay our dividend, manage debt levels, acquire new companies and buy back shares over the long term. We remain committed to these same priorities for cash deployment and building shareholder value for the future. In 2009, we were proud to have maintained our dividend during a challenging period and to have raised it for the 42 nd consecutive year. We had a plan to deleverage the company in 2009 and were able to reduce our debt by approximately $230 million. Protection of our strong investmentgrade rating remains a key element of our financial strategy, and the importance of doing so was highlighted this past year.

Stanley Black & Decker
The capstone event of 2009 was the announcement of our combination with The Black & Decker Corp., a company with a century-long legacy of excellence, customer focus and innovation. Along with Black & Decker comes a talented and motivated management team and workforce, world-class products and outstanding brands such as DeWalt, Black & Decker, Porter-Cable, Baldwin, Kwikset and Emhart Teknologies. The union of these two iconic global companies has been discussed by their various leaders for decades, and 2009 presented a once-in-alifetime opportunity to bring together two highly complementary companies with exceptional franchises. We believe the combined Stanley Black & Decker will yield excellent results for its shareholders and employees over the long term, the magnitude of which neither company could have achieved on its own. We have long considered the Stanley culture to be one of our key differentiators. It is a culture that is predicated on strong values: accountability, integrity and respect for individuals, with a growth orientation and a focus on innovation. These attributes enable us to create superior value propositions which we bring to our customers every day. Not suprisingly, the Black & Decker

culture has been a positive force behind their success as well. In the recent studies we have conducted, we have found that Stanley and Black & Decker share many more cultural similarities than differences. By combining the two organizations, we are creating a stronger and more talent-rich company, which will benefit from the unique strengths of each. Our future as the combined Stanley Black & Decker is exciting. Both companies have taken significant actions to right-size their cost bases over the past two years, and the combined potential for powerful operating leverage is immense. We expect the combination to yield an additional $350 million in cost synergies beyond the steps each company has taken individually. We also believe that we will

attain approximately $1.5 billion in EBITDA (refer to page 4) and $1 billion in free cash flow by 2012. The powerful financial rationale of the combination is clear, and we are now focused on successfully integrating the two companies. Stanley has an excellent track record of integrating companies, and both companies will continue to work together diligently to make this happen. Since 2002, Stanley has integrated nearly 60 companies, with a time-tested rigorous set of processes and procedures that has produced outstanding results. As a global organization, we have teams working daily around the world, staffed with members of both companies who have expertise in each critical business function, to ensure the integration of Black & Decker is a success.

The revenue synergy potential of the combined company is also highly compelling. Black & Decker's presence in Latin America and the Middle East creates an excellent launchpad for many of our Stanley and sub-branded products to grow in these emerging markets and burgeoning channels. We also see the potential for revenue growth within the strong foundation Stanley has laid in our global Industrial and Automotive Repair platform, which serves a number of global industrial channels that will benefit from the power of Black & Decker's DeWalt products. Additionally, Black & Decker brings a strong presence in the STAFDA (Specialty Tools & Fasteners Distributors Association) channel, which can be further leveraged to sell additional Stanley and Bostitch products.

of processes and operating metrics across our businesses, and allows us to hold management accountable for performance levels above and beyond a company of our current size. There is no silver bullet; it is a dynamic process that demands hard work and constant testing and refinement, and will continually evolve with our company as we grow and expand our business mix and geographic reach. The four critical elements of SFS are:  · Sales & Operational Planning, which works to keep supply and demand in balance.  · Transformational LeanTM, Stanley's trademark lean methodology that combines traditional supply chain and manufacturing lean approaches with the transformation of existing business models to create competitive advantage.  · Complexity Management, which eradicates complexity where we can in the products and services we offer and handles it efficiently and profitably in areas where we cannot.

Stanley Fulfillment System (SFS)
Sales & Operations Planning (S&OP) S&OP is a critical business process that keeps demand and supply in balance. S&OP involves tight controls across the supply chain through synchronization and rapid response to demand variation. Transformational LeanTM Transformational LeanTM is Stanley's proprietary methodology used to minimize inventory and overhead by streamlining our supply chain, manufacturing and back-office processes. It is thoroughly integrated with the other aspects of SFS, including Complexity Management, S&OP and Common Platforms. Complexity Management Complexity Management examines existing processes to identify and eliminate unnecessary activities to reduce cost and increase productivity. Complexity is tolerated only when it creates customer value. Common Platforms SFS involves the development of standardized business processes and system platforms to reduce costs and provide agility and scalability to facilitate organic growth and the integration of acquired companies.

Investing In Growth For The Future
For 2010 and beyond, we remain dedicated to investing for growth and shareholder value creation. We have a clear, three-pronged strategy: Continuously Strengthen the Core Business Portfolio Our platform for growth begins by having strong value propositions in our core franchises to drive organic growth, underpinned by our global reach and great brands. While a number of other companies decreased their brand support in 2009 due to the challenging economic climate, we invested over $20 million in our brands, launching new programs with Major League Baseball, English Premier League, and WALT DISNEY WORLD® Resorts, while maintaining our strong presence with Nascar. We will continue to strengthen our core businesses by focusing on achieving our operational objectives in every area of our company. Even as we integrate Black & Decker, it is a top priority to keep our fill rates up and exceed our customers' expectations. Further embedding SFS as a company-wide business system is crucial to our success now and in the future. Combined with a laser focus on innovative newproduct development, which we continued to support in 2009, we are ready to take advantage of any recovery in the markets we serve. Build out Our Five Major Growth Platforms One of Stanley's core competencies is building businesses through acquisitions. We believe there

are compelling strategic opportunities to deploy the free cash flow from the combined company to further diversify our revenues and end market exposures in the coming years by building out our growth platforms: Security Solutions (both Electronic and Mechanical), Infrastructure, Healthcare and Engineered Fastening. All are attractive high-growth, high-profitability areas that will create exceptional value for our shareholders. Expand Our Presence in Emerging Markets We remain committed to building out our presence in the developing economies of China, Southeast Asia, Brazil and the rest of Latin America, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and we believe we can do so more effectively as a larger organization with our increased size and scale. The combination of Stanley and Black & Decker unlocks opportunities to grow and compete in these emerging markets in a more robust way. We're excited about the established presence Black & Decker brings in Latin America, with revenues of approximately $400 million, and we look forward to seizing the opportunities this presents to sell more of Stanley's products through Latin American channels. We continue to see tremendous opportunities in the security markets in Asia and are focused on expanding our presence both organically and through acquisitions in the region to take advantage of the strong growth expectations of the market.

Mission In 2010 and Beyond
Stanley performed well in 2009, as our core value propositions, financial strength and flexibility, and successful diversification strategy left us well positioned for the future and confident as we undertake our transformational combination with Black & Decker. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the principles that have enabled our strength and success thus far. Our mission is clear. We must successfully integrate Black & Decker by avoiding distractions and deploying the tenets of SFS with rigor. We must protect our core franchises and ensure that we are positioned to succeed in any economic environment. We must remain vigilant on cost

control and productivity and be prepared to ramp up production quickly and efficiently as demand warrants. With our tenured management team and talented employee base, we are prepared to take on the challenges of 2010 and beyond and produce outstanding results for our shareholders.

The Company believes excluding the Q4 2008 after-tax restructuring and related charges of $47 million ($0.59 diluted EPS) is a better indicator of operating trends when analyzing EPS and EBITDA due to the unusually large magnitude of these charges in relation to the past 5 years. Such charges amounted to $67 million pre-tax. Therefore, the company has provided these measures both including and excluding such charges.  ree Cash Flow = Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures F minus capitalized software. In 2008, free cash flow also excludes income taxes paid on the gain from the CST/Berger divestiture due to the fact the taxes are non-recurring and the directly related gross cash proceeds are classified in investing cash flows. Refer to page 27 in the enclosed 10-K for the reconciliation of operating cash flow to free cash flow.
