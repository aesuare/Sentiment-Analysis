Dear EE investors, customers, regulators, and interested stakeholders,
For more than 100 years, El Paso Electric (“EE” or
the “Company”) has been dedicated to the long-term
success and well-being of our region. Our more than
1,000 local employees, management team and Board
of Directors are committed to continuing our history of
anticipating and investing in the plant, equipment and
facilities required to provide reliable, cost-effective and
clean energy for our growing region’s needs. These are
exciting times in our service territory, as we continue to
see significant growth; we now have more than 400,000
customers. We are also excited about changes within
the Company, the major construction projects we have
undertaken and the challenge of preparing for our future,
and our region’s future, in a rapidly changing world of
energy services.
At EE, it is our responsibility and obligation to provide
clean, safe and reliable energy at an affordable cost.
While we work hard to keep expenses down, the costs
of delivering reliable energy to our customers continues
to go up. Several years ago, we began planning and
investing to replace our aging plant and equipment and
provide additional resources for our growing service
territory. The time to make these improvements and
build additional capacity is now. Delay is not an option
if EE is to continue to have the most reliable and safest
grid possible. We are proud to be a top-ranked
investor-owned utility when it comes to reliability and
customer satisfaction, and we intend to continue to
excel in these areas for the benefit of our customers.

We have placed in service approximately $1.3 billion in
new assets over the last 6 years, including the recently
operational Montana Power Station (“MPS”) Units 1
and 2, the Eastside Operations Center, as well as new
transmission and distribution lines. As always, we are
planning and managing our expenditures to ensure
we are good stewards of our customers’ hard-earned
dollars and the capital entrusted to us by our investors.
We appreciate the trust placed in us by our stakeholders
as we provide for the current and future needs of our
customers and the communities we serve. Our ability
to serve our customers over time also requires EE to
ensure its financial strength by achieving a fair return on
its invested capital, which now requires the first significant
base rate increase in 20 years.
Now that MPS Units 1 and 2 are in-service, EE expects
to file requests to increase base rates in New Mexico
and Texas in the coming months. The need for rate
recovery is necessitated predominantly by the increase
in our invested capital driven by the replacement of plant
and equipment, as well as load growth. These rate cases
will be handled in a transparent, public process in which
many stakeholders, including residents, business owners,
and advocacy groups, will have input to the process.
Everyone’s interests will be represented.
2014 solidified EE’s role as a leader in renewable energy
and sustainable practices. Because we have the good
fortune to be located in the high mountain desert of the
Southwest, and due to the reduction in the cost of solar
panels, we have been able to incorporate significant
utility-scale solar generation into our portfolio at a cost
competitive with conventional fossil fuel alternatives.The
use of utility-scale solar provides the most economic
solar option for our customers and also allows all of
We currently plan to begin construction on MPS Units 3
and 4 during the second quarter of 2015, and expect
Unit 3 to begin commercial operation by the summer
peak of 2016, and Unit 4 by the end of 2016.
In February of 2015, Michael K. Parks, EE’s Chairman of
the Board of Directors, resigned from the Board after
19 years of valuable, dedicated service to the Company.
We thank Michael for his many contributions and wish
him all the best.
2015 will continue the challenging, but rewarding,
work of building new infrastructure for our growing
communities. We are reminded every day of the great
strides made by EE, as well as by our region, and more
importantly, of our potential. Our service territory is
gifted with extraordinary sunshine to power economical
utility scale solar facilities. Every day, the entire EE team
is working to provide reliable and cost-effective power
to our customers now and for the future, to generate
appropriate returns for our shareholders and to make
our communities and our Company even better places
to live and work.
On behalf of the EE team, we thank all our stakeholders
for the opportunity to serve.
