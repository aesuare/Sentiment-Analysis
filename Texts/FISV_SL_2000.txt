T H E C O R E B U S I N E S S of Fiserv -- information management technology -- is changing the way financial services providers do business. From the explosion of online technology to deregulation to consolidation among financial institutions, our industry continues to evolve. It's a new world, and financial services providers need a solid foundation to survive and flourish. Our goal is to help our clients open doors of opportunity by using technology for the benefit of their organizations and their customers. F I N A N C I A L H I G H L I G H T S Our operating results for the year continued strong, as we met our expectations for growth in revenues, net income and earnings per share. Fiserv annual revenues for 2000 were $1.65 billion, a 17% increase over the $1.41 billion reported in 1999. Net income per share-diluted for the year ended December 31, 2000, was $1.36 per share (before recognizing a $0.04 per share realized gain from sale of investment) compared to $1.09 in 1999.

M A R K E T I N F L U E N C E S : O N L I N E S O L U T I O N S Today it's possible to be online, connected, in touch -- all the time, anyplace. To keep up with consumer demand and growing competition, the financial services market has embraced online technology. And while our clients understand the benefits of e-commerce, they also realize the applications in demand are relatively new and highly specialized. That's why they turn to Fiserv -- because our e-commerce strategy leverages resources and technological developments throughout our organization to create advanced, proven solutions. We believe the influence of the Internet in financial services will continue to grow, and we've positioned our Company and our clients to capitalize on this evolving delivery channel. Fiserv provides some of the industry's leading online financial solutions, and we're continually expanding and enhancing our offerings to serve the needs of our clients -- and their customers. M A R K E T I N F L U E N C E S : I N D U S T RY C O N V E R G E N C E Banking, insurance and securities were once mutually exclusive markets, with clearly defined guidelines as to what providers could, and could not, offer their customers. As regulations relax, a new world of opportunities is opening for our clients, accompanied by a whole new set of challenges.

We will continue to enhance our service capabilities in response to the needs of our industry. M A R K E T I N F L U E N C E S : E V O LV I N G T R E N D S The financial services industry is dynamic, to say the least. Financial institutions today face new challenges on a daily basis -- from increased competition to demand for new products and services. To stay competitive, they must enhance customer satisfaction while improving efficiencies in all aspects of their businesses. For most, the key is effective use of technology. Trends show that financial institutions are looking to outsource more, offer additional online services and take advantage of diverse delivery channels. This means they need a strong technology partner with the resources, expertise and foresight to navigate an industry full of changing expectations. At Fiserv, our primary business is providing information technology services. We believe the market potential for our products and services remains strong, and we will continue to focus on the solutions that enable our clients to better serve their customers. We will adhere to our business strategy, utilize our ability to recognize and capitalize on industry trends, and never compromise our dedication to service excellence. I N A P P R E C I AT I O N We thank you for your investment and confidence in our Company. We will work hard to continue providing the results that you, our owners, expect and deserve.
