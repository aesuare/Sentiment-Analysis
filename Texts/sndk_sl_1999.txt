Reaping the rewards of relentless focus.
A LETTER FROM THE PRESIDENT

Fiscal 1999 was a year of remarkable growth and progress for SanDisk. During the year, the vision that we have nurtured for
the past decade finally began to fall into place as a beautiful quilt of emerging mega-markets. For several years we have talked about the post-PC era which will see the accelerating conversion of consumer electronics from analog to digital, the explosive growth in wireless/portable communications, and the swift transformations wrought by the advent of the internet and e-commerce. These mega-market forces will shape our lives in the new century. Each will require the power to compute, transmit and store vast amounts of digital information, be it e-mail, voice mail, music, video, images, digital books, maps or video games, and the infrastructure for switching, routing and storing this expanding bandwidth. This is SanDisk's opportunity, and our challenge: to provide the most reliable, most competitive flash storage to these new markets, and to be able to rapidly scale the volume of our business to allow us to maintain our leading market share position globally. I am happy to report that in 1999 we made great strides toward meeting our long-term strategic objectives. At the same time, we continued to demonstrate our attention to the daily details, and our relentless pursuit of lower costs through accelerated introductions of advanced technology.

financing in November. The company continues to operate conservatively with essentially no debt.

Driving these impressive numbers is a growing demand from consumer retail sales of our products, particularly into the digital camera market, which began to grow rapidly in the second half of the year. After a decade of working closely with key manufacturers such as Kodak, Canon, Nikon, and Hewlett-Packard to develop the digital camera market, we are beginning to realize considerable returns on our investment. By the end of 1999, SanDisk had shipped over three million CompactFlash memory cards to major OEMs and to more than 13,000 retail outlets worldwide. Today, more than 130 digital camera models sold in retail outlets throughout the world have slots for CompactFlash.

Also during the year, the MultiMediaCard product family gained strong support from the emerging Internet music player market, as well as the digital camcorder and smart cell phone markets. Because of the strong increase in demand, we were supply constrained for flash memory, and as a result were unable to meet our customer demand for MultiMediaCards during 1999. We are focusing significant efforts on adding new flash memory capacity to meet this burgeoning demand.

The numbers speak for themselves. Revenues for 1999 totaled $247 million, an increase of 82 percent over the previous year. Product revenues grew 99 percent over 1998 due to increased sales of CompactFlashTM and MultiMediaCard products. Royalty revenues increased 27 percent to $41 million. Net income grew 124% to $27 million, or $0.43 a share on a fully diluted basis. We greeted the new millennium with our balance sheet stronger than ever, with cash and investments of $457 million following a successful secondary

One of the most significant events of 1999 was the agreement between SanDisk, Matsushita Electric Industrial, and Toshiba to jointly develop and promote the new Secure Digital Memory Card. This high-speed, read/write memory card heralds the next generation of flash memory storage by providing cryptographic security

through its intelligent flash memory controller for protection of copyrighted data, including music, movies, and other digitally available commercial content. We believe that the security features of the Secure Digital Memory Card will be a key enabler for the secure electronic distribution of copyrighted works. First shipments of our new Secure Digital Memory Card are slated for the second quarter of 2000, however, we do not expect to generate substantial Secure Digital Memory Card revenues until 2001, when numerous new designs are expected to arrive on the market.

On the production side, we strengthened our manufacturing infrastructure through the increased emphasis on leveraging outside subcontractors for much of our manufacturing, assembly, and test operations. In fiscal 2000, we expect the majority of our production to be completed by subcontractors in China and Taiwan. As a result, our U.S. operations are now focused primarily on new and custom product development and production. With our world class manufacturing partners, we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant future growth in the market for flash memory.

In the fourth quarter, we announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Toshiba for the long-term strategic cooperation in the development and manufacturing of advanced flash memory technology. We expect this partnership to become an important element in SanDisk's market leadership in the years ahead. It is an exciting time at SanDisk. We are breaking new ground in many areas. We believe we are just at the beginning of a long period of sustainable growth. The key to SanDisk's ability to sustain our success lies in the execution of our plan by our employees, our greatest asset. Our employees are enthusiastic, highly dedicated During 1999, we relied exclusively on our foundry partnership with UMC for our flash memory production. Despite the severe earthquake in Taiwan in September, UMC was able to recover quickly, minimizing the interruption in our fourth quarter wafer supply. All in all, we shipped almost four times more megabytes of flash memory in 1999 than we shipped in all of 1998. and passionate. Their hard work has brought us to where we are today, a world class, highly respected, market leader. As we look ahead, we are confident that we will continue to reap the rewards of our passion for quality and our relentless focus on lowering the cost and improving the value to our customers of our flash memory products.

I am pleased to report the excellent progress we made in 1999 in our operations and technology groups. We began the year focused on the production of our 64Mbit flash chip. By the middle of 1999, we successfully transitioned to 128Mbit production. By the fourth quarter of 1999, we completed the production transition to our first 256Mbit double density flash chip. We believe that now, with the 256Mbit flash chip and its high performance, low cost controller in full production, SanDisk is very well positioned as a world class high volume, low cost producer of flash storage cards.

We are most grateful for your continued support.
