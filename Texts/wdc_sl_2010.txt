Fellow Shareholders:
Fiscal 2010 was another highly profitable growth year for WD, concluding a decade of strong financial performance as the company marked its 40th year of operation.
Looking ahead into our fifth decade, ever-increasing demand
for cost-effective, high-capacity storage continues to provide opportunity for substantial growth and consistent value creation, when addressed with an effective business model. With a relentless focus on customer needs, quality, low-cost, and high asset efficiency, WD has become solidly and increasingly profitable since adopting the basis of its current business model a decade ago. Over the last five years, we have profitably grown revenue
at a compound annual rate of 22%. In this same period we have grown operating income at a compound rate of 50% per annum. In fiscal 2010, we grew revenue 32% to $9.8 billion and we increased operating income by 194% year-on-year.
The hard drive demand growth story continues to be fueled by the proliferation of multiple devices and applications that are resulting in the generation, utilization and storage of massive amounts of digital content—most notably video—on low-cost, high-capacity hard drives. Storage devices are being utilized either locally or in the cloud, with WD addressing both of these opportunities in a significant way. We believe that the industry’s growth trajectory will continue over the foreseeable future, creating significant additional opportunity for WD with its expanding product set, to continue to generate growth on a sustained and profitable basis. We are also investing in and participating in adjacent markets such as solid state storage and media management in the home, to expand
our addressable markets and our opportunities for continued profitable growth.

WD ended fiscal 2010 with $2.3 billion of net cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $1 billion from fiscal 2009.
The growth opportunity in the hard drive market has been created in large part by our ability to continually drive down average cost per gigabyte, leading to attractive price points that have driven mass market adoption of devices incorporating hard drive storage. At the same time, we have gradually expanded gross margins while growing revenues by continuously increasing efficiencies and reducing costs.
While remaining highly profitable, we have continued to generate significant amounts of cash, further strengthening the industry’s highest quality balance sheet. We generated $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations during fiscal 2010. Our cash and cash equivalent balance of $2.7 billion at the end of the fiscal year exceeds our anticipated operating needs and provides us with operational flexibility, the ability to continue to invest in advanced technology, expand our product breadth through the pursuit of internal and external opportunities and protect against continued macro economic uncertainty. We continue to prudently review and evaluate all available avenues to increase shareholder value with our strong balance sheet.
Over the course of fiscal 2010, we derived significant return on our continuing investments in technology, new products, and improvements in our operations:
• We continued to lead the industry’s fastest growing segment— 2.5-inch drives—deploying industry-leading areal density products at the 640 GB, 750 GB and 1 TB capacity points.
• We made our entry into the traditional enterprise market with the introduction of our first 2.5-inch SAS-interface hard drives for server applications—part of our multi-year investment and commitment to serve this important and heretofore unserved market for WD.
• We brought to market our first client-oriented solid-state drive (SSD) to complement our existing portfolio of high reliability embedded SSDs, and we are in development of our first SSD for high-end enterprise applications.
• In our branded products business, we broadened our
portfolio of WD storage devices, with the introduction of
My Book® StudioTM LX external hard drives for Apple® users, and the My Book AV DVR Expander external drives which allow users to store more of their favorite movies and TV shows locally. We also extended our family of WD media players with WD TV® LiveTM Plus, featuring added services such as Netflix®, YouTubeTM, Flickr®, Pandora®, Live365® as well as MediaFlyTM that enables consumers to stream their favorite shows and personal content directly to their TVs. It was also the first network media player compatible with Windows® 7.
