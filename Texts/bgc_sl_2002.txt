TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
In 2002, General Cable weathered a second consecutive year of double-digit declines in the wire and cable market—unprecedented for an industry that historically has grown with the gross national product. By identifying trends early and taking immediate action,
we continued to reduce costs and enhance operational effectiveness. Despite the “perfect storm” in our end-markets during the past two years, we believe General Cable is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities we see ahead.
To fully appreciate the actions General Cable took in 2001 and 2002 to preserve our business and ensure long-term value for our shareholders, it is critical to understand the operating and economic environment that necessitated these actions.

THE PERFECT STORM
During the current economic downturn, which began in 2001, wire and cable end-market demand declined 20% to 50%. This extraordinary decline was driven by the convergence of several factors:
• The level of industrial construction fell 50% in the past two years and 70% from its peak in 1996.
• Overall industrial capacity utilization dropped 10%, dampening require- ments for maintenance and repair cables.
• Utility infrastructure spending decreased more than 20% during the period, in part driven by the energy crisis in California, the Enron scandal and lack of a coherent national energy policy.
• The highly publicized meltdown in the telecommunications industry caused telecom cable demand to fall by half from the level it averaged throughout the 1990s. Furthermore, sales of cables for local area networking declined with the cut in spending for information technology.
Pricing for many of our cables sank 10 points or more in some markets, as competitors initially sought to load underutilized factories and customers continued to press for year-over-year reductions.
Although the present industry slowdown is far greater than in previous cycles, we see light on the horizon and opportunities to leverage our com- petencies:
• Capacity is leaving the wire and cable industry as selling prices are approaching levels below the cash costs of production for many of our competitors.
• Demand for—and pricing pressure on—many of our products appears to have hit bottom.
• Legislative reform and stimulus in the energy sector are on the horizon.
• Pent-up demand continues to grow for utility and telecom infrastructure
improvements and maintenance.
• Industrial infrastructure and information technology spending appear to
be at or below maintenance levels.
• General Cable keeps improving operationally and has almost $400 million
of unutilized capacity, as well as a highly leveragable operating platform.

FIGHTING BACK
In 2000, we began a program to divest non-strategic and underperforming businesses from our portfolio and aggressively strip cost out of every aspect of our operations—from factory floor to corporate headquarters. We continued this process in 2002, when we closed two communications cable manufac- turing locations while retaining their production capacity in remaining facilities. We also eliminated more than 800 jobs. Our time-proven “One Company” customer-focused business strategy and our highly integrated operating platform enabled us to achieve both cost and service leadership in most of our business segments while driving nearly $60 million of inventory out of General Cable in 2002.
SEIZING OPPORTUNITY
During 2002, we continued to invest in our business, our people and our practices and procedures to be well positioned to fully enjoy a rebound in our markets.
• We completed Lean training for virtually all of our North American associ- ates. Lean tools enable a continual war on waste in our plants, distribu- tion centers, business teams and functional support areas. We also implemented more than 625 productivity projects. As a result, despite falling manufacturing volumes, we were able to offset fully the inflation- ary impact of rising costs, including labor and medical expenses.
• We expanded the use of electronic commerce. Nearly 55% of our customer transactions now happen electronically. Our website, which offers electronic catalogs, order status inquiry and customized reporting, received a record 47,000 hits in the fourth quarter. We plan to roll out web-based customer ordering in second quarter 2003. In addition, Vendor Managed Inventory programs now encompass 54% of our revenue base. We also conduct 50% of commerce with our top 100 suppliers electronically.
• We retained our status as the top-selling wire and cable manufacturer in the United States and moved up to number two in Canada. Our sales fell less than half the rate of the overall industry due to our rigorous focus on

customer selection and collaborative improvement. We also won impor- tant new energy cable contracts in Mexico and expanded our reach into specialty distribution throughout the Americas.
• We broadened our international presence. Leveraging our European manufacturing operations, we won significant utility contracts in France, Italy and the United Kingdom. From our Oceania regional headquarters in New Zealand, we expanded into Australia with a full range of products and won an important contract in Hong Kong. We also doubled our global contractor business, with special emphasis on the oil, gas and petrochemical industry. Our international business now accounts for nearly half of our operating profit.
• We delivered the best safety record in General Cable history. Our Occupational Safety and Health Administration incident rate, a metric for the frequency of injuries in our plants, was less than half of the average rate for our industry as a whole. This translates into both healthy associ- ates and reduced costs.
• We continued to drive efficiencies in our selling, general and administrative costs. SG&A was only 8.5% of sales––setting the benchmark for our industry.
• We completed a Material Review and Proficiency Process with major suppliers. Applying this process to about a third of our North American non-metals raw materials produced an annual savings of nearly $6 million. This is a never-ending process, reflecting our insistence that our suppliers help make us better every day.
• We reduced Company debt. General Cable’s total debt, both on- and off- balance sheet, declined 6.2% or $32 million. Since first quarter 2000, we have lowered our level of total debt 39% or slightly more than $300 million.
• We amended the financial covenants in our Credit Agreement through first quarter 2004. This provides us with increased financial flexibility during the coming year.
LOOKING AHEAD
We entered 2003 with the same resolve and focused business approach as in 2002. We will continue to drive cash out of the business in a variety of ways. We have targeted reducing our senior bank debt by more than

$100 million, which will come from strong operating cash flow, the sale of nonproductive real estate and refinancing initiatives. Our capital expenditure needs are less than depreciation. International operations today have a disproportionate share of opportunity and, as a result, will receive nearly half of our 2003 capital expenditures. We will continue to invest in associate training. The “Power of One” means that all associates must be involved in driving change in our business, and we are committed to giving them the tools to do just that.
We have identified and are actively working on thousands of projects across our global business aimed at further cost reduction. We are sharing best practices among our worldwide operations and discovering new cost savings opportunities daily. We will continue to raise the bar on service per- formance, making it an area of competitive advantage in every market and region. We also will continue to grow our business with key utility, distributor and retail customers while reducing total transaction costs.
As always, our customers will be able to count on General Cable for new ideas and services, allowing them to concentrate on their core business.
A SPECIAL THANK YOU TO OUR ASSOCIATES
So much of what we have accomplished is directly attributable to our associ- ates. We want to thank them for their hard work, individual sacrifices and dedication to achieving our goals. Their spirit and drive are remarkable. In 2002, our salaried associates led by example, forgoing wage increases, bonuses and a portion of their retirement contribution. Their commitment to our business and their belief in General Cable’s future are stronger than ever.
We thank all of our shareholders and customers for sharing that commit- ment and belief.
