  To Our Shareholders
In 2003, the future of our company was in doubt. After joining the company in August of that year, I asked our employees to join me on what I call “The Journey;” a trip we knew would require a great deal of time, determination, and patience, and through which we would rebuild our once great company.
As we began our journey, we focused our energy and resources on the following six strategic priorities:
• Establishing and sustaining a strong financial position • Attracting and retaining world class people
• Creating a strong culture of execution
• Building deep partnerships with winning agents
• Building a world class product and underwriting capability
• Providing responsive service delivery via a cost-effective operating model
Since then, we have maintained an unwavering focus on these priorities, and consequently, have evolved from a regional company to an organization that is regarded as The National Company with a Regional Approach.

We have made great progress over the course of our journey, and we are well on our way to achieving our goal. In particular, during 2010, we advanced our six strategic priorities through a number of significant investments, building on all we have accomplished over the past several years.

• Opened seven new offices to be closer to our partner agents
• Grew our Commercial and Personal Lines customer service centers, tailored
to each agent’s needs
• Improved our already highly rated claims services
All in all, we made important progress during the year, improving our position
as the best partner for winning independent agents. At the same time, however, given the significant number of investments we made in 2010, and the high catastrophe and weather-related losses that impacted our industry and our company during the year, the underlying earnings power of our organization was somewhat obscured. Nonetheless, we continually have invested in our business, building a company that would succeed over the long term. I believe that our dedication to the high-quality, value-added agency network, the diversification of our business by product and by geography, the introduction of what we expect to be higher margin specialty, niche, and segmented businesses, our account focus in Personal Lines, and our improved financial position, will produce tremendous dividends in the coming years. To date, we have achieved solid year-over-year improvements in ex-catastrophe, pre-tax segment income, as well as strong growth, building our net written premiums to $3.0 billion in 2010 from $2.2 billion in 2003.
While we have made important progress, there is a great deal more to be done, and it is imperative that we leverage the investments and improvements we have made over these past several years. With that in mind, in 2011, we will focus on three critical areas. First, we intend to capitalize on our investments, improving the operating earnings of our company. Second, we will further enhance the distinctiveness of the products we offer to our agent partners and their customers, to drive higher margins, better retention, and new business. And, third, we will continue to strengthen our position with winning agents.

I want to thank our shareholders, agents, policyholders, employees, and our partners in the communities where we work and live for their support throughout our journey. Building a world class company takes time and patience, but I believe our objective is achievable and within sight. I look forward to reporting to you next year as we make more progress on our goals.
