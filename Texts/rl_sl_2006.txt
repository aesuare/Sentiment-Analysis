Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer

dear fellow shareholders
I am proud to report another very strong year for Polo Ralph Lauren. One in which we continued to attract customers across continents and cultures with designs of elegance, quality and timeless style. Our passion for elevating the Ralph Lauren brands around the world remains our most powerful driving force. It is based on a deep understanding of our customers' desire for products that epitomize sophistication and a luxury lifestyle. We continue to develop sought after products and brands, to expand our retail store concepts and to grow internationally -- always maintaining the focus on our core strengths of world-class design and marketing, which are supported by our strong operations. We are very pleased with the success of our multi-year strategic initiatives as we balance our short-term performance with our continued emphasis on establishing and achieving long-term goals. We have never been more excited about our future growth prospects. We remain committed to the expansion of our specialty retail business and are delighted by our success -- in both sales and profits. Our retail results validate that we are successfully matching concepts and locations to customer needs -- and confirm our long-held belief that our stores are a powerful voice for speaking directly to customers. Both our U.S. and our international retail businesses are thriving and we see tremendous opportunity for further growth. We plan to open a flagship store with a license partner in Moscow next year. This year we opened a flagship store on Omotesando in Tokyo, bringing our unique vision of American style and elegance to Japan. This new luxury showcase offers the Japanese customer the full expression of our vision, including our Collection, Purple Label, Black Label and accessories lines. In addition to our new luxury Ralph Lauren stores, we also opened two Rugby stores this year -- one in New York City and one in New Canaan, Connecticut. The response from young adults to the hip, full-lifestyle Rugby collection has been so strong that we are accelerating Rugby and plan to open another eight stores by the end of next year. And Polo.com is one of our fastest-growing businesses, serving as a powerful marketing tool for our stores while offering our customers convenient access to the world of Ralph Lauren through online purchases. Our menswear, womenswear, childrenswear, accessories and home collections represent the best of what we have to offer both in our own retail stores and in department and specialty store shops. The quality of sales in our wholesale businesses has never been healthier. From Collection to Black Label to Lauren, we fill the varied lifestyle needs of our customers. In menswear we constantly enhance our offerings -- whether it be our RRL concept or RLX, offering the best styling for high-performance athletics. Our Childrenswear line continues to grow in its worldwide appeal. We offer both Lauren and Ralph Lauren products for the home, which range from furniture to bath and bedding to elegant table settings -- truly representative of the world of Polo Ralph Lauren. We have strengthened our licensing business by aligning the aesthetics of all products within a given brand. Over the past five years we have invested $1.4 billion back into the Company to support our acquisitions, retail expansion and wholesale shop-in-shops and to upgrade our infrastructure. A large part of this

investment has been dedicated to gaining direct control of several of our major brands. Consistent with this strategy, we bought back our footwear license in July 2005 and introduced elegant men's and women's collections for Fall 2006 to great acclaim. And while denim is already a strong category for us, the recent acquisition of Polo Jeans gives us the ability to develop our denim business to its fullest potential. In the midst of this growth and success, I want to welcome our newest Board member, Steven P. Murphy. As President and Chief Executive Officer of Rodale Inc., the magazine and book publishing company, Steve brings a fresh perspective to our industry, and we are already benefiting from his experience in building global brands in media, entertainment and publishing. I also want to thank Myron E. (Mike) Ullman, III for his counsel during a time of global expansion. Mike recently left our Board due to his commitments as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Our management team -- which is the best in the industry -- is a combination of deep experience and fresh energy, created by blending existing talent with select new hires. In our corporate culture, young professionals are paired with seasoned mentors, building an environment of support that moves ideas to implementation and develops the talent to lead our growth. Local expertise combined with the power of our global brands is providing us with the ability to enhance all aspects of our growing global business while fostering a diverse workforce. We have approximately 12,800 employees around the world and we take great pride in their passion, accomplishments, and continuing commitment to the Company's success. A deep commitment to our communities and to helping others remains at the core of our culture. We have a robust volunteer program, with our people donating their time and talent to a wide variety of worthy programs. This year we also contributed to the Denim Drive -- an exciting new Habitat for Humanity program. Our employees donated thousands of pairs of used jeans, which were recycled into natural fiber insulation for homes for families in need. And we continue to wholeheartedly support the fight against cancer with our very popular Pink Pony initiative and ongoing support for the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention in Harlem, which is now in its fourth year of operation. The breadth, depth, and continued strong performance of the Company make this and the years ahead an exciting time for all of us. I offer my sincere thanks to our Board of Directors, management, all our employees, business partners, shareholders and our valued customers.
