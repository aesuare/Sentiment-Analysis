LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
2001Dear Fellow Shareholder:
Sometimes, the best that can be said about a year is that it’s
over. For our country, our industry and our company, 2001 was one of those years.
From adversity, however, has come a renewed energy and determination to move forward – to overcome challenges both internal and external. This is as true for Federated as it is for America. So just as we are proud of our nation and its ability to rise to the difficult challenges we are facing in the aftermath of 2001, so are we proud of Federated’s 115,000 employees nationwide for the incomparable spirit and resolve they have demonstrated over these difficult past 12 months.
A confluence of factors influenced our 2001 performance, some of which were well outside of our ability to control. Among these were an economy dipping into recession, terrorism and tourism issues that significantly impacted major East and West Coast markets where Federated has sizeable concentrations of stores, power shortages and blackouts in California, and unseasonable weather patterns across much of the country that hurt sales of wear-now apparel throughout most of the year.
In addition to these external issues, there were internal factors influencing our performance, many of which we believe can be impacted positively. So it is in these areas that we are focusing our strategies and redoubling our efforts in 2002, with the singular goal of developing a more compelling business proposition for our customers to drive sales growth. We will not stand still until this is accomplished.
To achieve this goal, our objectives are clear:
• We will improve the shopping experience for our customers, making it easier and faster to purchase merchandise.
• We will make our delivery of value more apparent to the customer.
• We will narrow our merchandise assortments to make selections easier and presentations more convincing.
• We will focus on fashion and newness.
• We will make our stores more visually appealing and easier to navigate.
• We will tell our new story through effective marketing.
• We will continue to invest in developing our people.
  
Our singular goal for 2002 is to develop a more compelling business proposition for our customers to drive sales growth.

• We will increase profitability and return on investment.
We are committed to achieving results in each of these areas in the year ahead, even as we continue to build on some of the more notable successes of the last year.
2001 Progress
Although our successes tend to be overshadowed by the year’s larger issues, they are significant because they bode well for the future of our department store operations:
• an ability to continue generating significant amounts of free cash flow from our department store operations, despite pressure on sales – approximately $775 million (after capital expenditures but before the acquisition of Liberty House), compared to approximately $600 million in the prior year;
• an encouraging recovery in the fourth quarter, which enabled us to exceed revised sales and EBIT forecasts;
• year-end inventories that were down about 7% on a same-store basis – a difficult feat to achieve, but one that positions the company well for the year ahead;
• an exceptionally strong private brand program that consistently outperforms the industry, and that has grown to represent 16% of Federated’s total 2001 sales;
• solid progress in growing our junior’s and young men’s businesses, which significantly outperformed the rest of the store in the last year;
• opening of a new prototype department store – Lazarus at Easton Center in Columbus, OH – where we are testing an array of new service and merchandising concepts;
• the acquisition of Liberty House, with stores in Hawaii and Guam, and its virtually flawless integration into our Macy’s West division;
• the elimination of Stern’s and the conversion of 17 stores into Macy’s in New York and New Jersey, which further solidified Macy’s positioning in those markets, and planned conversions of two New Jersey Stern’s stores to Bloomingdale’s, slated for this year.
In January 2002, we announced our intent to dispose of Fingerhut, preferably
through the sale of its operations as a going concern, or in the case of the Fingerhut catalog, by closure of the business. In total, we expect to realize approximately $1.1 to $1.3 billion of after-tax proceeds, net of one-time costs, over the next four years as a result of this disposition.
Federated acquired Fingerhut in 1999 primarily for its e-commerce potential. Knowing what we do now, we certainly would have done things differently three years ago.

 Yet having said that, we also know that being willing to take prudent risks is integral to running a business. Indeed, in today’s competitive retail environment, we believe there is greater risk in standing still and accepting the status quo than in stepping out from the crowd, testing new concepts and trying to move forward.
Stepping Ahead
In 2002, we will resolutely pursue the goals for driving sales growth outlined above, with the objective of generating a significant improvement in earnings and return on investment.
We plan to open 14 new stores this year – 11 new department stores, two Bloomingdale’s home stores in Las Vegas and Chicago, and a new Burdines Furniture Gallery in Fort Lauderdale – and we will continue to test and roll out new prototype concepts in these stores as well as incorporating some of these advances into our ongoing store remodel program. A total of $700 million has been budgeted for capital expenditures in 2002.
We also are investing in our people. Federated’s advanced Leadership Institute is among the industry’s most outstanding training programs, and a catalyst for Federated being recognized as one of Training magazine's Top 100 corporations “unsurpassed in harnessing human capital.”
This is where we have been and where we are headed. We’re confident we have the right people, the right strategies, the right priorities and a strong balance sheet
in place to ensure progress and profitability in 2002, and we are committed to delivering that result.
Sincerely,
