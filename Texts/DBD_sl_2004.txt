Diebold annual report 2004

FELLOW DIEBOLD SHAREHOLDERS: As the cover of our annual report states, Diebold has been conducting business now for more than 145 years. I have been fortunate to lead this company as chairman and chief executive officer for more than five years.

Let's start by looking at how we have changed over the past five years since 1999: ­ Revenue increased 89%, from $1.26 billion in 1999 to $2.38 billion in 2004. More of this revenue now comes from recurring services ­ about 50% in 2004 compared with about 40% in 1999. More revenue also came from international markets, which contributed $903 million in 2004. At the same time, we've also more than doubled our security business since 1999, generating $594 million in product and service revenue in 2004. Earnings per share rose from $1.85 in 1999 to $2.54 in 2004, a 37% increase. Our dividend payout rose to $0.74 per share in 2004, a 23% increase from 1999 and our 51st consecutive annual dividend increase. Our total return to shareholders since 1999 was 159% vs. -3% for the S&P 500.

During that time we have faced significant challenges, including market volatility and economic weakness. Additionally, our company has experienced increased competition and continuing transformation within our markets. We've also faced unprecedented opportunities: expanding our portfolio of products and services for our core self-service and security markets, tapping into new sources of demand in faster growing, developing countries and leveraging our skills and expertise to enter new markets that offer high-growth potential. Through it all, our management team has been guided by a consistent vision and strategy. The key elements of this vision include attaining global market leadership in financial self-service; developing a comprehensive strategy to harness the power of technology and drive our business forward; enhancing our service capabilities; and becoming a faster, more responsive and efficient company with which it is easy to do business.
STILL FOCUSED. Today we're still focused on these initiatives and, as we measure our progress, two things become clear. First, we've come a long way in a relatively short period of time. And second, we still enjoy significant potential to grow our company, improve how we do business and enhance our profitability.

We're proud of these results, and they testify to the hard work, energy and commitment of our employees. We're prouder still of the consistency we've shown in our ability to generate improved results, year in and year out. What makes us most excited is that we're just at the beginning of our journey. We've only begun to capitalize on the opportunities for profitable growth that lie ahead. We've only begun to harness the power and potential from the significant improvements we've made in how we do business.
OUR MARKETS: STILL DYNAMIC. At the heart of our confidence and enthusiasm about the future is the fact that the markets we serve are still dynamic and still growing.

base through increased automation. As a result, we face significant opportunities to strategically partner with our customers and to provide the products and services they need to optimize their return on investment. At a time of heightened concern about personal safety and business continuity, the market for security solutions is growing. To address this opportunity, we're continuing to expand our offerings to financial institutions, as well as commercial, government and retail markets. During 2004 we acquired two companies, Antar-Com and TFE Technology, broadening our portfolio of products and services. The election systems business is another market with significant potential. Although it has been a subject of controversy in recent years, the 2004 U.S. presidential election demonstrated the value of electronic voting to more accurately capture and count every vote cast. For example, in Georgia the number of uncounted votes in this year's U.S. presidential election plummeted ninefold, compared with the 2000 election, to only 0.39% of votes.The improvement was directly attributable to the reliability of Diebold's electronic touch-screen voting machines, which replaced a clearly less accurate punch card system. Looking ahead, Diebold Election Systems has the right technology, whether optical scan or touch-screen, to help states and jurisdictions move to meet Congress' deadline for replacing punch card and lever machines by 2006.We can also extend the technology to register more voters and count more absentee ballots. We can find ways to make voting easier and more convenient. And we will continue to work with

In developed countries, the financial self-service business is being driven by the introduction of new technology such as Opteva, as well as by the need to upgrade ATM networks due to regulatory, legislative and competitive issues.The recent Check Clearing for the 21st Century (Check 21) Act in the United States, for example, is driving financial institutions to embrace check imaging as a way to reduce transportation costs, processing costs and fraud risks associated with physically processing the original checks. Diebold offers ATM check-imaging solutions to financial institutions wanting to take advantage of opportunities presented by Check 21. Financial institutions around the world are also seeking to optimize the value of their branch banking networks. In some countries, this stems from the need to more effectively serve a growing middle class customer

policymakers and other interested parties to address electronic voting concerns and build an election infrastructure worthy of one of the most precious rights we have ­ the right to vote.
STILL IMPROVING. While the growth and vibrancy of our markets are important factors in our future success, so are the strides we have made, and continue to make, in improving how we do business.

another important factor: the energy that Diebold employees bring to the playing field each and every day ­ the energy to take the extra step, to improve how we do things, to better serve customers, to build value for shareholders. In a world in which our customers' needs are ever changing, where our competition isn't standing still and where opportunities are quickly captured or lost, we cannot and will not rest. Not when there's so much more progress to be made and potential to be realized.

The success of our Opteva ATM family and Agilis software is a case in point. The conception, design, manufacture and marketing of these products marked a turning point for our company. They represent the improvements we have made across our organization in terms of enhancing our interaction with customers, leveraging our research and development capabilities, streamlining and rationalizing our manufacturing operations, improving the efficiency of how we do business and working together more effectively across functions and boundaries. Because of their importance to our future performance and success, we will continue to focus intently on continued operational improvements as we move forward. Eric Evans, who joined Diebold as president and chief operating officer in January 2004, is superbly qualified to lead these efforts. Eric and the rest of our management team are working hard to capture the potential of these internal dynamics, as well as market opportunities residing on the outside.
STILL ENERGIZED. A dynamic marketplace, an outstanding technological skill set and a strong focus on operational excellence are the key reasons for our confidence in Diebold's future. There is, however,

Sincerely,

Walden W. O'Dell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
