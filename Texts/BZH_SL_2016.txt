 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
As we entered Fiscal 2016, we established a new objective alongside our “2B-10” Plan: to reduce our leverage over the next few years while pursuing our growth ambitions. Fiscal 2016 represented a successful first step in the implementation of this “balanced growth” approach. During the year, we increased both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, significantly reduced our outstanding debt and extended our maturities. More specifically, we began the fiscal year with a goal of $50 million in net debt reduction, increased that goal to $150 million in the third quarter, and ultimately ended the year reducing debt by nearly $157 million. With a significant portion of our debt-reduction goals completed, we have set ourselves up to focus on top-line growth, improved operating margins and larger investments to accelerate our growth in Fiscal 2018 and beyond.

     The “2B-10” Plan
In November 2013, we outlined a set of objectives: to reach $2 billion in revenue with a 10 percent Adjusted EBITDA margin. We named this our “2B-10” Plan. As we described at that time, reaching “2B-10” would require improvements in five key metrics: sales per community per month, average selling price, community count, homebuilding gross margin and cost leverage (i.e., improving the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to total revenue).
We have consistently noted that there are
a number of potential paths to achieving the underlying goal of generating $200 million of Adjusted EBITDA specified by our “2B-10” Plan. To help demonstrate these paths, we introduced targeted ranges for each of our key metrics in November 2015:
We are pleased with the progress we have made so far:
Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
When we introduced our “2B-10” Plan, we had just reported our Fiscal 2013 results. At that time, we had a gap of $712 million to reach $2 billion in revenue and 3.3 points in Adjusted EBITDA margin to reach 10 percent. In dollar terms, we had a gap of about $114 mil- lion of Adjusted EBITDA.
Over the last three years, we’ve made significant progress. Our total revenue in Fiscal 2016 was in excess of $1.8 billion, up nearly $200 million from the prior year, and more than $530 million since we announced our “2B-10” Plan. Our Fiscal Year 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $156 million marks the fifth consec- utive year of EBITDA growth for the Company, as well as an 8.5 percent increase over the previous year.
Sales Per Community Per Month
Our sales pace during Fiscal 2016 averaged 2.7 sales per community per month, slightly below the 2.8 we recorded in Fiscal 2015. Although our sales pace was partly affected by an unusually slow first quarter, it remains near our targeted pace of 2.8 – 3.2. We expect to move into this range as we progress through Fiscal Year 2017.

 The Gatherings
For more than a decade we have been developing higher-density, age-restricted communities in our mid-Atlantic market under the Gatherings brand. These com- munities consist of four-story, 27-unit condominiums with four different two- bedroom, two-bathroom floor plans. The economics of this building, and the sites it allows us to acquire, enable us to target downsizing Baby Boomers who wish to remain in, or near, the neighbor- hoods in which they currently live. To these buyers, the convenience, safety, affordability and low-cost maintenance of a Gatherings home represent an exceptional value compared to other alternatives. To accelerate our Company’s growth trajectory, we will be expanding our Gatherings product throughout our geographic footprint, and we’re confident that these communities will become a significant part of our results in the next few years.
  Community Count
We ended Fiscal 2016 with 161 active communities, down from 166 the previous year, but up significantly from our 134 active communities when we announced our “2B-10” Plan. Following the success of our debt-reduction efforts this year, our capital allocation priorities will shift more heavily toward land investment as we focus on growing commu- nity count for Fiscal 2018 and beyond.
Average Selling Price
Our Fiscal 2016 average selling price of more than $329 thousand is the highest in the Company’s history and puts us on the edge of our targeted range of $330 to $340 thousand. This marks the fifth consec- utive year of increased average selling price as we continue to focus on targeting value-oriented, first-time and first-time move-up buyers throughout our geographic footprint. Additionally, our average selling price of homes in backlog at the end of the year was nearly $341 thou- sand, suggesting continued growth as we move forward.

Homebuilding Gross Margin
In Fiscal 2016, we delivered a homebuilding gross margin of 20.6 percent, down 90 basis points from the previous year. This reduction was expected, coming from a combination of increased use of option lot deals, activation of assets formerly classified as land held for future development and a concentration on lower- margin spec sales in the first half of the fiscal year to generate liquidity for debt reduction. Following two quarters of sequential increases to close out this year, we expect further gross margin improvement in Fiscal 2017.
Fixed Cost Leverage
Our SG&A expenses were 12.3 percent of total revenue for Fiscal 2016, down 50 basis points compared to Fiscal 2015. This marks our fifth consecutive year of improved SG&A leverage, and we expect continued progress toward our “2B-10” target of 11 to 12 percent.
Reducing Financial Leverage with a “Balanced Growth” Approach
In Fiscal 2016, our operational emphasis was heavily weighted toward improving our balance sheet, and we focused our efforts on reducing our leverage and refinancing our near-term maturities. We made significant strides this year, extending our maturities, lowering our interest expense and reducing debt by nearly $157 million. Following the actions we under- took during Fiscal 2016, we now have no debt coming due until 2019, outside of our sched- uled Term Loan amortization payments.
The Beazer Difference
We are constantly updating and improving the homes we offer. In fact, we believe that buy- ing a Beazer home provides the best new home value of any offering in the industry. Specifically, we emphasize three key pillars of differentiation to our customers:
Mortgage Choice – We attempt to create a less stressful mortgage application process for our
customers by selecting a preferred set of lenders based on quality customer service, available loan programs and competitive rates. These lenders then compete to earn our customers’ business, which allows each buyer to select the right mortgage and lender for his or
her purchase.
Choice PlansTM – With “Beazer Choice Plans,” we have created alternative floor plan options for every plan we offer. These Choice Plans allow buyers to configure their primary living areas to match their preferences and require- ments at no additional charge.
Energy Efficiency – In 2016, Beazer was once again named the ENERGY STAR® Production Builder of the Year by the Department of Energy. We were an early leader in energy and water conservation, and we continue to build highly efficient homes. Every Beazer home is ENERGY STAR certified and rated by a third party, enabling our homeowners to save up to 30 percent on monthly energy use.
Conclusion
We want to thank you for your continued support as we move forward with our “balanced growth” approach. We were pleased to deliver profitable results for Fiscal 2016 and are con- fident that the steps we took to improve our operations and bring the Company back to profitability have created a foundation for further growth and additional profitability in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr.
