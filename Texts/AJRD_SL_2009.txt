Dear Shareholders,
The Company made solid progress in 2009 toward our goals of continuously improving financial and operational performance to create value for our shareholders and customers. During the year, we increased sales by $53.1 million to $795.4 million, compared to $742.3 million for 2008. Net income also improved to $59.3 million, or $0.97 diluted earnings per share, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.03 diluted earnings per share for 2008.
Significant steps were taken to address the Company’s capital structure requirements.
In December 2009, after the conclusion of the fiscal year, the Company issued $200.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.0625 percent convertible subordinated
debentures in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers. The
refinancing generated net proceeds of approximately $195.0 million,
a portion of which were used to refinance our 4 percent Notes in
January 2010, and significantly increases our flexibility.
Also after the conclusion of the fiscal year, the Company named Scott J. Seymour president and chief executive officer of GenCorp Inc, and president of Aerojet-General Corporation. Mr. Seymour also joined the Company’s Board of Directors. He has more than 35 years of aerospace and defense experience, recently serving as corporate vice president and president of Northrop Grumman’s Integrated Systems sector (now Aerospace Systems).
 Significant steps were taken to address the Company’s capital structure requirements and increase our flexibility.
 Aerojet – Demonstrating Leadership
In 2009, Aerojet continued to play an increasingly significant role in the safety and security of the United States by providing mission-critical technologies to the country’s space and defense programs.
For more than 60 years Aerojet has been an industry leader and
pioneer in the development of critical products and technologies that
have strengthened the U.S. military and enabled the exploration of
space. In 2009, Aerojet continued to play an increasingly significant
role in the safety and security of the United States by providing
mission-critical technologies to the country’s space and defense programs. This is illustrated by our ever-increasing role in missile defense through our position on Terminal High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD) and STANDARD Missile and PATRIOT product families. In addition, our space products continued to support all U.S. military and government launches with 100 percent mission success.
 
Aerojet maintained its strong position in the defense market segment in 2009 and continued to enhance its position as a propulsion leader in missile defense and tactical systems. Significant wins included the Solid Propulsion Throttling Divert and Attitude Control Systems, PATRIOT Advanced Capability-2 (PAC-2), Stinger and other solids programs. Important follow-on awards included MK 104 and MK 72 rocket motors for STANDARD Missile 3; PATRIOT Advance Capability-3 (PAC-3); and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System.
During the year, Aerojet space systems won a significant contract for the Taurus 2 Program with Orbital Sciences and continued its track record of flawless performance on several space exploration and other critical missions. They included the Mercury Messenger Flyby; H-2 Transfer Vehicle’s successful first mission; and launches of Delta II, Delta IV, Atlas V and space shuttle. These successes strengthen our legacy of supplying innovative and dependable propulsion systems to the DoD and NASA – as we have since the inception of the U.S. civil and military space programs – and support our position as a critical supplier to our space systems customers.
Aerojet’s 2009 sales were $787.2 million, compared to $725.5 million in 2008. The increase in sales was primarily the result of growth in the various STANDARD Missile Programs and increased

the next-generation Constellation program, we believe that, as the only supplier of
all propulsion types, Aerojet is especially well positioned at DoD and NASA.
deliveries on the PAC-3 Program. Segment performance was income of $90.3 million in 2009 compared to income of $40.8 million in 2008.
In 2009, Aerojet ended the year with a backlog of approxi- mately $1.2 billion, an increase of nearly $155 million, or 15% higher than the previous year, that was comprised
of both new and follow-on awards. This backlog growth validates our strategy of increasing our presence on core legacy programs through superior program performance, while capturing new awards by offering innovative solutions that meet the needs of our customers.
In early 2010, the President unveiled his FY2011 Budget request for the DoD and NASA. Even with the proposed cancellation of the next-generation Constellation program, we believe that, as the only supplier of all propulsion types – solid, liquid, airbreathing and electric – Aerojet is especially well positioned at DoD with its missile defense, tactical and in-space product lines and at NASA due to its diverse offerings, innovative technologies and existing contracts with both traditional and emerging launch providers.
 
Easton Development Company – Preparing for Recovery
Easton’s value in anticipation of a real estate market recovery.
The Company continued its efforts to reposition 6,000 acres of its excess Sacramento land under the brand name Easton. In 2009, a new wholly-owned subsidiary, Easton Development Company, LLC, was formed to continue to execute entitlement and
pre-development activities, and to explore how to maximize
 Our plan reflects efforts to make Easton one of the finest master-
planned communities in the U.S., and will include a broad range
of housing, office, industrial, retail and recreational uses that we
believe will enhance the long-term value of our land. Value enhancement may include outright sales or joint ventures with real estate developers, residential builders or other third parties.
Within Easton, approximately 1,450 acres are entitled, and we are seeking entitlements on an additional 4,600 acres. Easton is located 15 miles east of downtown Sacramento, California along U.S. Highway 50, a key growth corridor in the region. The Company believes Easton has several competitive advantages over other areas, including several miles of freeway-accessible frontage, one of the largest single-owner land tracts suitable for development in the Sacramento region, and a desirable “in-fill” location surrounded by residential and business properties.
Committed to Community – Stewardship and Philanthropy
GenCorp is committed to conduct our business in an ethical, safe and customer-focused manner which protects and preserves the environment. The Company also takes seriously its role as a corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate. We continue to aggressively address our environmental remediation obligations, using state-of-the-art

 sustainable technologies. At our Sacramento plant alone, we are pumping and treating approximately 24 million gallons of groundwater per day.
A key accomplishment in 2009
was the installation of the largest single-site industrial solar installation in California and one of the largest
in the United States.
A key accomplishment in 2009 was the installation of a
3.6 megawatt solar facility on 20 acres of our Sacramento land
in partnership with the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District and Solar Power Inc. Subsequent to that installation, Aerojet announced that an additional 20 acres and 2.4 megawatts would be
 
added to the solar field in 2010, making it the largest single-site industrial solar installation in California and one of the largest in the United States. These six megawatts of power will be used exclusively by Aerojet and will offset approximately 30 percent of the power required for on-site environmental remediation at our Sacramento plant.
Through the GenCorp Foundation and employee volunteerism, the Company actively supports hundreds of educational institutions and nonprofit organizations. Since its inception 10 years ago, the Foundation has provided more than $7.5 million to the Company’s communities.
Looking to the Future
The improved financial and operating performance we achieved in 2009, as well as the increased flexibility enabled by our refinancing, better position us to meet the challenge of today’s economic
 We will build upon the positive momentum of 2009 and continue to take steps to reduce operating costs and to improve our overall liquidity.
environment. We will build upon the positive momentum of 2009 and continue to take steps to reduce operating costs and to improve our overall liquidity.
Externally, our nation’s defense and space institutions will
confront a very complex, ever-changing security environment and will face difficult budget decisions. We will address this business challenge with a relentless
customer focus and superior program performance across our diversified portfolio of legacy and emerging defense and space capabilities.
Sincerely,
