Pope & Talbot, Inc.
To Our Shareholders:
For the year 2005, Pope & Talbot, Inc. reported a net loss of $50.0 million, or $3.09 per share, compared to net income of $11.1 million or $0.69 per share in 2004. This dramatic change in financial results is attributable to a number of factors, but the three most significant were the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar, lower pulp and lumber prices compared to 2004, and a $22.3 million valuation allowance recorded against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets.
The Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate averaged $0.83 for 2005 vs. $0.77 in 2004 and was $0.86 at year-end 2005. The Company estimates this continued weakening of the U.S. dollar increased cost of goods sold by $41.3 million in 2005 compared to 2004. Increased sales volumes for both pulp and lumber drove an 11 percent increase in revenues in spite of lower average price realizations for both pulp and lumber, which declined 2 percent and 8 percent respectively.
The Company’s mills ran well this past year, with pulp production increasing 2 percent to approximately 820,000 metric tons. Lumber production increased 31 percent to 884 million board feet. The increase in lumber production is predominantly due to the April acquisition of the Fort St. James sawmill which produced 177 million board feet of lumber from the acquisition date through the end of 2005.
Capital spending, including the $37.6 acquisition of Fort St. James, increased to $81.3 million in 2005 from $25.2 million in 2004, while total debt increased $96.8 million. This increase in debt, in combination with a $51.6 million decrease in stockholders’ equity resulted in a year-end total debt to capitalization ratio of 75 percent, a significant increase from 59 percent at year-end 2004.
Lumber duties continued to be a contentious issue in 2005 and the total duty deposits made by Pope & Talbot increased $37.3 million from $85.8 million to $123.1 million. In early December the U.S. Department of Commerce lowered the combined duty rate approximately 46 percent from 20.15 percent to 10.81 percent, significantly reducing the expected cash duty payments for 2006.
As a result of the Company’s deteriorating financial position, we suspended our quarterly dividend in the fourth quarter of 2005. In addition, we sought and received covenant amendments and waivers from many of our lenders during the third and fourth quarters of 2005 and the first quarter of 2006. We continue to closely monitor our liquidity and covenant compliance. Primarily due to our recent losses and financial covenant compliance issues, our independent auditors have expressed in their opinion on our 2005 financial statements substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
To address our financial issues, we are currently in negotiations to refinance our Halsey pulp mill leases and Canadian and U.S. credit facilities and, while we can’t assure you that the refinancing will occur, we are hopeful that the transaction will be completed in the second quarter. We will also consider possible asset sales to generate cash to reduce debt, or potential equity issuances to generate cash and improve the balance sheet. In considering alternatives, we are also cognizant of the possibility of a negotiated settlement of the Canada-U.S. softwood lumber dispute which could result in the refund to the Company of a substantial portion of the cash import duties deposited by the Company since 2002.
