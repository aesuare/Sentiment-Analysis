CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES and SHAREHOLDERS,
At Nordstrom we've always aspired to do one thing well: serve our customer in an exceptional way. We've found that good things happen when we let the customer be our guide. This approach has served us well, driving our strategy and leading to strong results and consistent success. Our goals are simple: to serve our customers better, to always be relevant in their lives and to form lifelong relationships. And while serving our customer face-to-face is the foundation and hallmark of how we've historically served them, today customers seek out service in new ways. Speed, convenience, innovation and personalization have become cornerstones of the customer experience. Guided by these new needs, we continue to invest in the cross-channel experience, combining the accessibility of a pure online experience with the high-touch inclusivity of our stores. Highlights of our progress in 2013 include the following:

Here, in more detail, are some of the ways we are better connecting with our customers. A MORE RELEVANT, ACCESSIBLE EXPERIENCE Relevance can mean merchandise that appeals to specifc customer segments or capabilities that respect our customers' time constraints. As an example of the former, in 2013 we added more accessible price points in our Savvy department, with compelling brands and merchandise that turns more quickly. We also expanded Topshop boutiques in Nordstrom full-line stores, from 14 in 2012 to 41 in 2013. Topshop's unique merchandise has also helped evolve our trend ofering to reach new customer segments. Another example of improving relevance is pop-up shops--a great way to attract new customers with uniquely curated merchandise that's new to Nordstrom. In October we launched Pop-In @ Nordstrom, an ongoing series of pop-up shops in selected Nordstrom stores and at nordstrom.com. As our customers' defnition of service constantly changes, we're responding by evolving our store environments. We're working to build in more fexibility, and give customers a sense of openness, discovery and inclusivity as they move through our stores. This is all part of creating a better shopping experience that's more relevant and intuitive. An example of using capabilities to

FOUR WAYS TO SHOP. ONE NORDSTROM EXPERIENCE. CUSTOMERS CAN SHOP THEIR WAY--IN STORE, ONLINE, FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE. AND EVERY TOUCHPOINT IS A CHANCE TO MAKE THEM FEEL GOOD--WITH THE SOUGHT-AFTER STYLES AND PERSONALIZED CUSTOMER SERVICE THEY'VE COME TO EXPECT.

We always try to leave our customer feeling good by providing compelling merchandise and the best experience possible, no matter how they shop with us. Though it's easier said than done in today's rapidly changing landscape, we believe we have the team, capabilities and customer strategy to make it happen. Ever since our founding, our success has been defned by empowered, knowledgeable and motivated people dedicated to serving customers. That will never change. As our customer expectations evolve, we're changing and broadening our touchpoints strategically. Today, Nordstrom is an integrated retailer serving customers through four distinct yet complementary businesses: in store full-price (Nordstrom full-line stores), in store of-price (Nordstrom Rack stores), online full-price (nordstrom. com) and online of-price (HauteLook and soon nordstromrack.com). Each business represents a doorway to the Nordstrom experience and a meaningful growth opportunity individually. And together they contribute to our ability to attract and retain customers--now and in the future. This is important because we know our most engaged customers shop with us in multiple channels and give us a greater share of their discretionary dollars. Currently, Nordstrom is the only retailer that can serve customers across all these channels.

I love the frenzy created from a pop-up shop--that spontaneity and emotion is one of my favorite things about working in retail.

provide better service is our salesperson texting app, which we created because almost one-third of our customers prefer to be contacted by text message. With our new NEXT app, salespeople can send their customers who enroll with them easy-to-check text messages about fashion news, recommendations, and reminders for upcoming sales and events. The secure app protects personal information and saves time, while seamlessly allowing customers to opt in and out. NEW FULL-LINE STORES In 2012, we announced our plans to expand our full-line stores into Canada. We recently increased our initial planned openings from four stores to six. Our frst store is scheduled to open in Calgary at Chinook Centre on September 19 this year--followed by Ottawa, Vancouver and three in Toronto, through 2017. We're excited about this milestone in our store expansion and look forward to serving more customers in Canada. Other planned openings include our second full-line store in the Houston market at The Woodlands Mall on September 5, and a new store in Jacksonville, Florida, at the St. Johns Town Center on October 10. We also evolved our in-store experience with new store designs at The Grove in Los Angeles and The Americana at Brand in Glendale, California. This year, we'll begin a two-year remodel of our fagship store in downtown Seattle. During the next few years, we'll open full-line stores in Milwaukee, Puerto Rico and Minneapolis, in addition to the planned opening of our frst full-line store in Manhattan in 2018. NORDSTROM RACK Nordstrom Rack is an important part of our ofering and a key contributor to our growth strategy and results. Rack customers love the treasure hunt experience and the chance to fnd signifcant savings on many of the same great brands we carry at our full-line stores. It's a terrifc business and several years ago we made a determined efort to serve more customers by accelerating

and where they want to fnd it. The Rack Alerts app is the frst of its kind and puts the customer squarely at the center of his or her own shopping experience. E-COMMERCE For some time, e-commerce has been the fastest-growing part of our business, and that continued to be the case in 2013. We've been investing in this highgrowth business for many years to better position us with customers as they change the way they want to shop and be served, including website enhancements, mobile app updates, personalization, and improved fulfllment and delivery. We're getting items to customers faster with the addition of a new fulfllment center in 2013 in San Bernardino, California. We've broken ground on a second center to open in 2015 in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. We also invested early in our organizational structure to ensure that we could deliver a seamless experience and merchandise ofering across categories. This year, we expanded our online selection by 30 percent, and our customers can decide where to shop, pick up or have delivered, and return items at their convenience. SOCIAL MEDIA Social media continues to play a key role in engaging with customers across generations in these channels, and we view this as a service tool that allows us to better listen and respond to customers. For example, Nordstrom has 4.4 million Pinterest followers,

our Rack growth. Ten years ago, we had 48 Rack stores. We plan to have 167 by the end of 2014, and 230 by 2016. Our customer response to our newest Rack stores across the country has been outstanding. Previous technology investments have been a key part of our strategy to enhance the customer experience at the Rack. We've completed the conversion to mobile checkout, and this has continued to make a big diference in our store experience in terms of both speed and convenience for our customers. In 2013, we added two other signifcant enhancements: Search & Send and our Rack Alerts app. Search & Send allows salespeople to use mobile registers to search our entire Rack inventory for a desired item or size and have it delivered to a customer. With our recently launched Rack Alerts app, customers can tell us what they're on the hunt for

Our goal is to create a best-in-class experience, and as with everything we do, we'll learn and fnd ways to improve our methods over time.

`crowd-sourced' in-store Pinterest merchandising. Customers can shop popular `Top Pinned' items in certain departments that are marked with Pinterest signage. To support the multi-channel shopping experience, we also integrated Top Pinned items at nordstrom.com. Social media is a dynamic area of the business that requires us to move faster and try new things. Though we've made good headway, we're still in the early innings with e-commerce and will continue to invest aggressively in its growth. ONLINE, OFF-PRICE HauteLook allows us to take advantage of the rapidly growing online, of-price marketplace and helps us develop our e-commerce capabilities in the online, of-price channel. As of 2013, we have 16 million members, up 300 percent since we acquired HauteLook in 2011. As an enhancement to the customer experience in terms of convenience, customers can now return HauteLook merchandise to any Rack store,

and we've added Rack merchandise to the HauteLook mix to complement their fash-sale ofering. We're also building nordstromrack.com, which will launch in 2014. The world of retail changes daily, and always has. We'll stay squarely focused on our number-one goal of putting the customer frst in everything we do and how we apply resources. As our customers evolve, as they surely will, we're positioned to serve them well.

CHAIRMAN
At Nordstrom our overarching goal is to improve the customer experience, which challenges our team to earn each customer's trust every day. Our strategy is focused on delivering a fabulous customer experience that is second to none, and we believe our success over time is a function of achieving this goal. In 2013 Nordstrom achieved growth and many successes, despite a challenged retail environment. Our fnancial performance benefted from a strong fnancial discipline and the integration of the many ways Nordstrom serves customers across channels. Investments in e-commerce, acceleration of Rack store expansion, and investments in technology, innovation and capabilities all helped Nordstrom deliver the experience that customers expect from a premier retailer. Nordstrom today, like most companies in the digital economy, is at an infection point as the Internet redefnes service. The Internet allows customers to shop 24 hours a day, everywhere, with a profusion of choices. Customers who grew up with the Internet are empowered in new ways and shop with fresh expectations, while others are catching up quickly. Our new growth will come from serving customers when and where they want. In our original `four-wall' model, Nordstrom made shopping a personal experience. As our business evolves and a larger share of our growth comes from our e-commerce and Rack businesses, we strive to extend this trusted relationship to every new touchpoint and how the customer wants to shop. Trust is earned by a commitment to do the right thing. At Nordstrom, management has long understood that creating a great place to shop means creating a great place to work. The company not only has consistently respected and empowered the customer, but it has also respected and empowered
