                                         Business conditions improved significantly for the containerboard and corrugated products industry in 2006. Since the fourth quarter of 2005, three industry- wide containerboard price increases, totaling $120 per ton, were announced, as were three corresponding price increases for corrugated products. These price increases were driven by steady demand for corrugated products and historically low containerboard inventories. Corrugated products shipments per workday were up 1.3% in 2006, and starting with the industry consolidation and capacity rationalization that began in the late 1990s, container- board inventories have trended downward at a fairly steady rate (chart below), and remained at historically low levels during 2006.
For 2006, net income was $125 million, or $1.20 per share, compared to $53 million, or $0.49 per share in 2005. Net income for 2005 includes income of $7 million, or $0.06 per share, from a dividend paid by Southern Timber Venture, a timberlands joint venture in which PCA holds a 31% ownership interest, and a $1 million, or $0.01 per share, charge for the closure of a box plant and other severance charges. Excluding these items, adjusted net income for 2005 was $47 million, or $0.44 per share. Full year sales were $2.2 billion in 2006 compared to $2.0 billion in 2005.
The increase in 2006 net income of $78 million, or $0.76 per share, compared to 2005’s adjusted net income was driven primarily by higher pricing, improved sales volume and a higher margin product mix which together improved earnings by $124 million, or $1.19 per share. These earnings improvement items were partially offset by higher labor and benefits costs ($20 million, or $0.19 per share), transportation costs ($12 million, or $0.11 per share) and energy costs ($11 million, or $0.11 per share).
Cash generated from operations in 2006 totaled
$247 million. Cash uses were $105 million in common stock dividends, $88 million for capital expenditures, $4 million for acquisitions and $9 million for debt repayments. PCA ended the year with $162 million cash-on-hand compared to $113 million at year-end 2005, a $49 million increase.

PCA benefited from these improved business conditions and reported record earnings in both the third
and fourth quarters of 2006, excluding special items for any previous quarter. For the year, earnings almost tripled to $1.20 per share compared to 2005’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.44. Earnings were up substantially in the

                                         Operationally, both our box plants and mills had an outstanding year in 2006. PCA’s four containerboard mills set new records for production, up 2.4% over 2005, while, at the same time, controlling cash manufacturing costs, up only 1.8% per ton compared to 2005. Our mills continue to be among the lowest cost in the industry with significant fiber and fuel flexibility. In terms of fuel flexibility, our low usage of natural gas distinguishes us from other industry competitors, and offers us a unique cost advantage.
Our corrugated products plants focused on mix and margin improvement, and achieved the full pass through of three containerboard price increases to boxes over a shorter timeframe than normal. We also exited some lower margin national account business which reduced our volume growth, but helped improve our overall margins. For the year, our corrugated products shipments per workday were up 0.8% over 2005, compared to industry growth of 1.3%. However, as shown below, PCA’s corrugated products volume is up 33% since 1999, compared to 2% for the industry.
The reduction in MDP’s ownership added an additional 28 million shares to the public market, an increase of 43%, and 4.5 million of their shares were repurchased and retired by PCA in December 2005. MDP’s ownership of PCA now stands at 11.8 million shares, representing 11% of the shares outstanding.
Entering 2007, business conditions for the container- board and corrugated products industry remain favorable. We ended the year on a strong note with corrugated products shipments per workday up 5.5%
for the industry in December compared to the previous year. Industry containerboard inventories, which normally increase in December, actually fell by 82,000 tons and ended the year at 2,432,000 tons which, on a weeks of supply basis, is the second lowest year-end level in the past 25 years. This decline in inventory was driven by strong corrugated products demand as well as by a decline in mill operating rates from 100.1% in November to 97.3% in December. The U.S. dollar has also remained weak, which is favorable for the export of linerboard from the U.S.
The price of recycled fiber (OCC) has increased signifi- cantly since the beginning of 2007, which in turn, raises the manufacturing costs for containerboard. Fortunately for PCA, we are among the least dependent in our industry on OCC as a fiber source with OCC representing only 17% of our purchased fiber. Transportation costs also remain high and will continue to be driven, in large part, by oil prices.
Our strategy has always revolved around the concepts of operational excellence and shareholder value. We believe that you hire and develop the best people possible, give them the direction, resources and authority to be success- ful, and in the end,“our people will make the difference.” Unlike many companies, PCA has not relied on a major restructuring or transformation program to improve performance and drive shareholder value. Instead, our efforts have remained focused every day and every year on improving every important element of our business. We believe that this intense focus on operational excellence is the key driver of shareholder value. Finally, we will continue our efforts to utilize the financial and strategic flexibility that we possess to create and return value to our shareholders.

PCAcontinued to return value to its shareholders in 2006, paying out a quarterly dividend at an
annual rate of $1.00 per share, with a yield of 4.5%. This is the highest dividend in the industry, based on PCA’s year-end closing stock price.
We also continued to invest in the business. Our normal level of capital expenditures has been about $110 million per year which equates to about 75% of depreciation. In 2005, we spent $125 million as we accelerated some high return projects, so our goal in 2006 was to reduce capital spending to about $90 million. We met that goal, spending $88 million, and did not delay any major projects.
Since December 2005, PCA Holdings LLC, an entity controlled by Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC (MDP), has reduced its holdings in PCA by 32 million shares.
