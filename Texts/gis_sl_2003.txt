To our shareholders:
General Mills delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2003, our first full year of operation following the October 2001 acquisition of Pillsbury.
-- > Net sales grew 32 percent to $10.5 billion, reflecting good business growth and an

incremental five months of Pillsbury results. On a comparable basis (as if we had owned Pillsbury for all 12 months of both 2002 and 2003) our sales grew 6 percent. -- > Our profit margin expanded as we captured cost synergies from the acquisition. -- > Net earnings doubled to $917 million. -- > And our earnings per diluted share (EPS) rose 81 percent to $2.43, up from $1.34 reported in 2002. Results for both 2003 and the prior year included certain costs primarily related to the Pillsbury acquisition. These costs are the restructuring and other exit costs identified on our consolidated statements of earnings, and merger-related costs that are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Earnings and earnings per share, excluding restructuring and merger-related costs, are measures of performance not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). We separately identify these costs because they represent expenses associated with an infrequently occurring event, and we believe identifying them improves the comparability of year-to-year results from operations. You should refer to the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes in our 10-K report for a detailed discussion of these costs, which amounted to $85 million after tax in 2003 and $118 million after tax in 2002. Excluding these restructuring and merger-related costs, our 2003 earnings per diluted share would total $2.65, up 56 percent from $1.70 in 2002. The table on page 14 of this report provides a reconciliation of our earnings per share with and without the restructuring and merger-related costs.

Our U.S. retail businesses led operating performance in 2003. Net sales for these businesses grew 25 percent to exceed $7.4 billion, and operating profits grew 66 percent to $1.8 billion pretax. On a comparable basis, net sales grew 6 percent. Comparable unit volume increased 4 percent, led by gains from Big G cereals, Yoplait yogurt, Betty Crocker dinner mixes and Progresso ready-to-serve soups. Consumer retail sales of our major retail product lines rose 5 percent and our composite market share increased slightly for the year. As shown in the table on page three, our major brands hold leading positions in attractive, fastgrowing retail food categories. It was a difficult year for our Bakeries and Foodservice division. Sales for this business segment increased 42 percent to $1.8 billion. However, operating profits and comparable unit volume were essentially unchanged from the prior year. In part, this reflected a difficult U.S. foodservice industry environment. Poor business trends for a number of our customers restrained our volume growth. In addition, price increases that we implemented to offset higher commodity costs took longer than planned to realize. Beyond these issues, profits for Bakeries and Foodservice were hindered by our own manufacturing realignment activities. As we complete the integration of the General Mills and Pillsbury supply chains, we are relocating manufacturing of various product lines from one plant to another, and the short-term disruption has been particularly pronounced for this division. We expect these manufacturing shifts to continue to restrain Bakeries and Foodservice results through the first half of 2004, but then begin contributing to longer-term growth.

International business results in 2003 were very good overall. Net sales for our wholly owned international businesses grew 67 percent to reach $1.3 billion. In addition, our proportionate share of international joint venture revenues increased to more than $990 million. Comparable unit volume rose 2 percent, as we posted gains in every geographic region but Latin America, where volumes fell 20 percent due to difficult macroeconomic conditions. If you set Latin America aside, our comparable international unit volume increased 6 percent. Operating profits for the wholly owned businesses doubled to $91 million pretax. And our share of joint venture profits, which are included in our income statement on an after-tax basis, nearly doubled to reach $61 million. We achieved our goal of realizing $350 million in cumulative acquisition cost synergies in 2003. In addition to these savings, our supply chain fixed cost rate per case improved as our unit volumes grew. These factors contributed to an increase in our profit margin. After-tax earnings as a percent of sales rose from 5.8 percent in 2002 to 8.7 percent in 2003. General Mills' good performance in 2003 resulted in superior returns to shareholders. For the fiscal year, the market price of General Mills stock increased just over 3 percent, and dividends of $1.10 per share represented a yield of more than 2 percent, for a 6 percent total return to shareholders. In contrast, the S&P 500 Index delivered a negative 12 percent return to investors over the same period. We outperformed our peer companies by an even greater margin -- total return for the S&P Consumer Staples Index was a negative 15 percent. This outperformance isn't a one-year phenomenon. Total return to General Mills shareholders has exceeded the market's return over the last five years, and over the last 20 years, as well. In fact, as the chart on the inside front cover of this report shows, GIS has outpaced the market for most of our 75-year history as a publicly held company.

We believe we are strongly positioned to deliver superior growth and shareholder returns in the years ahead. We've established specific growth goals for the threeyear period through 2006. Those goals are:
-- > 5 to 6 percent compound annual growth in net sales. -- > At least 11 percent compound growth in earnings per share. -- > Increasing cash flow from operations, sufficient to support the capital investment needs

of our growing businesses while reducing debt by a cumulative $2 billion over the threeyear period.

Cost Synergies and Productivity

We expect fiscal 2004 to give us an excellent start toward these goals. We have a strong lineup of product news and innovation planned for the year. In addition, 2004 is a 53-week fiscal period, so we'll have the benefit of an extra selling week in the fourth quarter. We expect operating profit to grow faster than sales, due in part to an additional $125 million of acquisition synergies we plan to realize this year. This would bring our cumulative annualized acquisition synergies to $475 million. Our 2004 plans do include some additional Pillsbury merger-related and restructuring costs. We are currently estimating those at approximately 10 to 15 cents per share. We expect our EPS growth in 2004 should meet or beat our 11 percent longer-term growth target, both including and excluding the restructuring and merger-related costs. We plan to drive our growth in 2004 and beyond by focusing on the same four strategies that fueled our past performance. Those strategies are:
-- > Product innovation, which drives unit volume and market share gains. -- > Channel expansion, to ensure our products are available everywhere people buy food,

from dollar stores to delicatessens.
-- > International expansion, to build our brands in fast-growing markets around the world. -- > Margin expansion, to grow our earnings faster than sales.

We continue to believe that adding Pillsbury has made each of these growth strategies better. We think our mix of retail categories offers great opportunities for product and marketing innovation. We see exciting opportunities to expand distribution of our leading brands in fast-growing new retail channels, including natural and organic stores, and club stores. In addition, we've strengthened our opportunities to capture a growing share of away-fromhome food sales. With the addition of the Pillsbury international businesses, we now generate more than $1 billion of our net reported sales in markets outside the United States. Through our wholly owned operations and our joint ventures, we expect to show continued strong growth in international sales and profits. And finally, we expect to drive margin expansion through a continuous focus on productivity savings. For our supply chain operations alone, productivity over the next three years is targeted at a cumulative $300 million pretax. The following pages of this report to shareholders discuss these four critical growth drivers in more detail. We have confidence that these proven strategies will lead to superior results in the years ahead.

There is one last critical factor that increases our confidence in General Mills' future prospects. It is the strength of General Mills' people and our company's unique culture. General Mills has a long history of success, and our values are strong. We care a lot about our company's culture -- and we work hard on it -- because it is key to recruiting and retaining top people. We're convinced our pay-for-performance and stock-based compensation programs are fundamental to our company culture and our superior performance record. For nearly all employees, annual cash compensation is variable, and ties directly to annual ratings of both personal and business unit performance. To underscore the importance of sustained business growth and returns, we've sponsored long-term compensation plans designed to make employees at every level of the company holders of General Mills stock. These programs have included four all-employee stock option grants. The most recent of those, in 2002, reached more than 26,000 employees. This annual report features 42 of our colleagues from around the company. Their combined direct holdings of GIS exceed 22,500 shares. Factor in stock options, and their ownership interest exceeds 500,000 shares. In total, we estimate employees and directors hold nearly 7 percent of our stock. We believe this compensation philosophy promotes business actions in the long-term best interest of the company and all its shareholders. Our performance-based culture, our portfolio of leading consumer brands and our focused growth strategies have combined to produce superior returns for General Mills shareholders over an extended period of time. All of us at General Mills today are committed to delivering results that will build on this track record in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
