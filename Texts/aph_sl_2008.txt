 2 AMPHENOL CORPORATION
    Dear Fellow Shareholders:
2008 was another record year for Amphenol.
We gained significant position in all our target markets, becoming the second largest company in the interconnect industry in 2008. The success we experienced in a generally moderate demand environment is reflected in the strength of our financial performance:
• Sales of $3.2 billion up 14% from last year
• EPS of $2.34 up 21% from last year
• Free cash flow of $373 million up 31% from last year
In 2008, we continued to outperform the industry, thereby further expanding our solid foundation for future performance. This foundation is based on the strength of our agile, entrepreneurial manage- ment team and the unwavering commitment of that team to execute Amphenol’s philosophy for the benefit of customers, shareholders and em- ployees. This philosophy has resulted in long-term industry-leading growth and profitability and is based on the following core principles:
• Create opportunities for growth and margin ex- pansion by providing performance-enhancing interconnect technology to our customers
• Maintain close contact with and support of local markets and customers
• Manage risk through diversification and flexibility
• Manage the Company’s money as if it were our own, through efficient investments and relentless cost control
• Capitalize on the acquisition opportunities created by a fragmented industry
• Maximize operating performance through a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure with clear accountability for results
We made significant progress in 2008 in the major markets we serve, strengthening our preferred supplier relationships with leading equipment manufacturers, while extending our technology innovation, broadening our geo- graphical presence, and expanding our product portfolio. The diversity of our market positions served Amphenol well in 2008.
• The military and commercial aerospace market represented 19% of our sales in 2008 and in- creased 16% over the prior year. We continue to benefit from the trend of increased electronic content in air, land and communication-related military aerospace equipment, as well as in new aircraft. In addition, we are continually expand- ing our technology offering to provide a com- plete interconnect solution in this market. While fluctuations in government budget priorities could impact demand in 2009, Amphenol’s in- dustry-leading product breadth and program participation position us strongly for the future.
• The industrial market represented 12% of our sales in 2008 and increased 6% over the prior year. We continue to benefit from our strategic focus on diverse, high-growth segments of the industrial market, including oil, gas and geo- physical exploration, alternative energy, rail mass transit, medical and power applications. Significant growth opportunities are arising from the increased use of sophisticated and complex electronic components, as well as from demanding new power and data inter- connect solutions. We have done an excellent job of increasing our presence with leading global industrial equipment manufacturers and we believe that the proliferation of em- bedded electronics into new industrial applica- tions will continue to create momentum in 2009. While we expect moderation in certain segments of the industrial market in 2009, we are optimistic about our growing position in this important market.
   
• The automotive market represented only 7% of our sales in 2008 and declined 1% from the prior year. 2008 was a challenging year for the auto- motive industry, with unprecedented reductions in end market demand and production levels. Al- though we anticipate further moderation of this market in 2009, we are confident of our technol- ogy position in new automotive electronics, in- cluding especially our growing position on future hybrid electric vehicle platforms.
In the communications and information technology markets we gained significant position in 2008.
• The information technology and data communi- cations equipment market represented 23% of our sales in 2008 and increased 8% over the prior year. Our innovative new products and value-add capabilities have continued to drive leading penetration in the areas of servers, stor- age systems and networking equipment. We are very encouraged by continued new design wins, particularly of our industry-leading high-speed products and unique power solutions, and we see demand expanding for high-speed, minia- turized and value-added products. We believe that even in a potentially more moderate de- mand environment, we have the opportunity for further expansion of our market position as we continue to build on our distinct competitive advantage of offering a complete interconnect system architecture.
• The broadband communications market repre- sented 10% of our sales in 2008 and increased 6% over the prior year. Growth was driven by our earlier price increases and demand result- ing from new broadband services offered by the cable television operators, as well as by growth in international markets. We serve the broadband market primarily with coaxial cable. In addition, we continue to broaden our participation in this market with interconnect products for “triple play” voice, video and data enabling equipment.
• The mobile network market represented 14% of our sales in 2008 and increased a strong 25% over the prior year. We have excellent pre- ferred supplier relationships with the leading infrastructure equipment manufacturers in all regions. In addition, we further strengthened our participation in interconnect and antennas for cell site installation, including in important emerging markets such as Africa and India. Our acquisition of Jaybeam Wireless at year end also enhanced this offering. We provide the industry’s most complete, integrated prod- uct solution to the wireless infrastructure mar- ket, including RF, high-speed data, fiber optics and power solutions. Overall, this market offers promising opportunities for us in the future as subscriber growth and continued increase of data and multimedia traffic drive growth in demand as well as technology evolution. Our broad position on next generation equipment platforms makes us confident for 2009, as the build out of these networks is likely to accelerate in certain regions.
• The mobile device market represented 15% of our sales in 2008 and increased a strong 31% over the prior year. While overall unit growth of mobile phones was approximately 6%, we were able to grow substantially faster through con- tinuous product innovation. Our focus on de- manding product areas such as low profile connectors, hinges and antennas has increased the value of our content per device. In addition, these high performance products are increas- ingly required in other mobile consumer de- vices whose proliferation is increasing our overall market opportunity. We continue to benefit from our diversity in customers, device models and products. Although total units may decline in 2009, we expect continued expansion of our position in the mobile device market.

 We continue to invest prudently, but proactively, to position ourselves for the future.
We further expanded in 2008, investing $108 mil- lion in new tooling and manufacturing and test equipment, ensuring that our capacity and tech- nology capabilities meet the dynamic demands of our customers. In addition, we continued our expansion into new geographies to capture the exciting opportunities in those areas as well as to explore new low-cost potential. In 2008, we opened new facilities and operations in China, Malaysia, India, Dubai, Tunisia and South Africa. At year end, we employed approximately 30,000 worldwide, with 70% of our workforce in low- cost countries, positioning us well for superior profitability in any demand environment.
We also continue to pursue our strategy of ac- quiring complementary companies with strong, entrepreneurial management, excellent technology, and potential to gain leverage from Amphenol’s global resources. In 2008, we completed three strategic acquisitions, expanding Amphenol’s presence in a number of growing markets. These acquisitions included a French manufacturer of value-add interconnect systems for the military and commercial aerospace markets, a U.S. manu- facturer of audio connectors for the military aerospace market, and an international provider of high technology base station antennas for
the wireless infrastructure market. We are very excited about the growth potential created by these new family members and continue to ex- plore additional acquisitions that are accretive to future performance.
We continue to focus intensely on the ongoing de- velopment of our industry-leading technical and managerial talent. Our management team is expe- rienced, committed and passionate, with a shared dedication to the highest levels of customer service and performance. In addition, we have continued our practice of recruiting new talented individuals to augment a management team which is largely homegrown. At the end of 2008, we seamlessly completed the internal transition of R. Adam Norwitt from Chief Operating Officer to Chief Executive Offi- cer. Simultaneously, Martin H. Loeffler, the Company’s long-term Chief Executive Officer, assumed the newly-created role of Executive Chairman, with continued focus on the strategic development of the Company. We are excited that this transition ensures for Amphenol the continuity of our successful culture and business philosophy. The entire Amphenol team has created significant value through many business cycles and is well-prepared to meet the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities that may arise in 2009.
As we look forward, we continue to see a unique expansion opportunity for Amphenol in a frag- mented industry and estimated $40 billion worldwide interconnect market.
Current market trends play to our strengths: • Globalization
• Customer and vendor consolidation • Integrated solutions
• Emerging markets
• Challenging technology
• Electronics proliferation
       
We have capitalized on these trends. We have more than doubled our market share to 8% in the last decade while delivering average EPS growth in ex- cess of 22%. This outperformance is a direct result of the consistent application of our strategy by our op- erating executives and the local general managers of each of our over 65 operating units worldwide. Their drive to maximize the performance of each of their businesses in their particular market and region is what sets Amphenol apart.
While the uncertain world economy is creating sig- nificant challenges for most businesses, the consis- tent application of our strategies has positioned Amphenol well for 2009 and beyond. Along with the industry, we experienced a reduction of end market demand in the fourth quarter of 2008 and anticipate further moderation in 2009. As is our cul- ture, we took quick and decisive action to appropri- ately adjust our cost structure to lower demand levels, including reducing headcount by approxi- mately 17% in the fourth quarter. These actions en- abled the Company to continue to be competitive in the market and allowed our management to focus on continued customer support and technol- ogy development. It is our consistent strategy to combine our pursuit of leading technology with our culture of strong operating discipline. We will drive proactive cost reductions to stay ahead of competition. We will react quickly at the local level

to market dynamics. We will maintain financial disci- pline. And we will continue to drive accountability and a superior performance culture down to every level of our organization. This is the Amphenol dif- ference. This is how we will continue to enhance overall return and how we intend to outperform
the industry in any economic environment.
While we cannot predict when growth will return to the world’s economies, we believe the current market challenges create a unique opportunity for Amphenol. The combination of our value- creating technologies, relentless cost control and agile, entrepreneurial management team have created industry-leading financial strength. As we enter 2009, we are confident that this financial strength will enable us to focus on furthering our support of and innovation for our global cus- tomers, allowing us to continue to expand our market position. Our team has prepared Amphenol well for the challenges of 2009 and is energized by this opportunity. We look forward with great enthu- siasm to the potential in 2009 to build a base for our further industry leadership in years beyond.
It is with our full commitment and that of every employee that we continue to move Amphenol forward to produce superior performance for our customers, satisfaction for our employees, and excellent returns for our shareholders.
