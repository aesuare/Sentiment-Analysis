   To Our Shareholders:
Five years ago, we set our sights on becoming the leading U.S. direct bank and a flexible global payments partner.
Our focus on that vision has allowed us to pursue new opportunities and has led to consistently strong performance across a number of key metrics. Today, we are connecting more and more customers with a brighter financial future.
Over the last five years, Discover has expanded significantly in direct banking. We now offer credit cards, personal loans, private student loans, home loans, deposit products and checking accounts that help our customers achieve their financial goals.
We have grown to be the world’s third- most-accepted network* by partnering with financial institutions, acquirers, processors and other companies around the world to leverage our Discover, PULSE and Diners Club International networks.

Direct Banking Accomplishments
Credit card loan growth of 6% outpaced the industry average, driven in
part by the popularity of our flagship Discover it card. One of our greatest accomplishments of 2014 came when Discover received the highest customer satisfaction ranking among U.S. credit card companies, tying for the top ranking in the 2014 J.D. Power U.S. Credit Card Satisfaction StudySM—
a recognition bestowed upon us by our customers.
Discover pioneered cash rewards in the credit card industry, and today Discover continues to innovate in ways that are important to customers. In 2014, we enhanced our Cashback Bonus rewards program by providing customers with multiple redemption options with no minimum for redemption, and with rewards that will never expire. We also launched Discover Deals, which provides customers with opportunities to earn extra cash rewards and to receive instant savings while shopping.
Also in 2014, Discover led the industry by providing free FICO® Credit Scores to all eligible Discover cardmembers—online and on monthly statements. Knowing and understanding their FICO Credit Scores can help cardmembers achieve their personal goals and better prepare for the future. Customer response has been overwhelmingly positive.
Of course, our growth in credit cards would be of no value to shareholders were it not profitable growth. Accordingly, we have continued to focus on leading-edge practices in credit risk management. As a result, we continue to outperform most large competitors when it comes to credit quality.
We are leveraging our expertise in credit risk management across other consumer lending products. In 2014, we grew personal loans by 19% and private student loans by 4% (22% growth rate excluding purchased student loans). We also made Discover Personal Loans more widely available to the general public, and Discover Student Loans launched rewards for good grades.

 Discover.com/company
For Discover Home Loans and Discover Home Equity, 2014 was largely about positioning for the future. Discover Cashback Checking exceeded 100,000 cross-sold accounts by year end, and we look forward to a broad market launch in 2015.
Payments Accomplishments
In 2014, Discover achieved growth in dollar volume on our networks while expanding acceptance to more than 31 million global merchant locations and more than 1.6 million ATMs. In addition, our proprietary network continued to be an integral component of card issuance by providing added branding, acceptance and value for Discover cardmembers. We believe that owning
a proprietary, branded network contributes to the related card business,
and that it is no accident that the two U.S. credit card issuers with their own networks have had stronger profitability in terms of return on card assets than most of their competitors.
Our accomplishments in payments in 2014 included:
• Launch of a new business-to-business payments platform with Ariba®, an SAP company and a leading global business commerce network.
• The signing of agreements in Thailand and Cambodia that enhance the presence we already have in Asia through UnionPay (China), JCB (Japan), BC Card (Korea), RuPay (India) and others.
• Endorsement by the American Bankers Association (ABA) of Discover Debit, a compelling alternative signature debit program.
Discover Debit and Pulse PIN debit are great products, but the U.S. debit market is very challenging right now. Certain competitor actions have adversely affected the marketplace, and Discover continues to aggressively address these challenges head on.
Other challenges in payments included Diners Club in Europe and the loss of a large third-party issuer in 2014. Longer term, we are excited about

    the many innovations and new players in the payments industry, and we are well positioned to partner with established and emerging players in the years ahead.
Connecting to the Future
In retail banking, the trend is increasingly toward use of direct channels (online, mobile, phone and mail). According to the ABA, direct channels are now preferred by 54% of customers, compared with only 21% who prefer branches and 14% who prefer ATMs. Our unique business model puts us in excellent position to better connect customers with this increasingly direct future. As a bank and a network, Discover interacts on a daily basis with consumers, merchants, acquirers, other financial institutions and other networks on a global scale.
Our industry tends to focus too much on transactions, but for consumers
it’s not always just a “transaction.” It’s often a broader “experience” that can span months or years. The broader customer experience encompasses many potential touch points—and many opportunities to add value— including the customer’s research and discovery process, special offers
that they might receive, a wide variety of payment options, the decision to finance the purchase or not, dealing with returns and disputes, rewards and redemption offers, and the use of financial management tools to monitor or analyze their spending.
At Discover, we are continuously expanding the information on credit card usage we provide—by sending two-way text messages to confirm purchases, for example. We also provide customers with tools to analyze their spending habits, and we have a feedback loop that includes customer call listening, complaint monitoring and the use of social media.
In addition, we focus on simplicity of interaction, ease of communication and intuitive designs for our website and apps. As a result, the number of mobile app users at Discover has doubled in the last two years—and half are now mobile-only users. We also have many “firsts,” including being the first major card issuer to offer fingerprint login and pre-login account information.
      
 Discover.com/company
As we move forward, Discover will be guided by long-term principles, including our focus on providing outstanding rewards, service and value
for our customers, and on being a flexible partner in the payments industry. Our plans for 2015 include the new Discover it Miles card, which we launched in February. We will also continue to enhance and add new Discover it features. In addition, we will focus on online and mobile banking enhancements, including e-wallets, while simultaneously working to manage credit risk and enhance operations.
In payments, our focus will be on using our proprietary network to enhance the customer experience for our cardmembers. We will also continue to leverage our capabilities in emerging payments and our relationships
with other global financial institutions and organizations to grow global acceptance and network volume. In addition, we will work to increase penetration of the market for signature debit. And finally, as the payments industry transitions to EMV technology in the United States in 2015, we will carefully manage the transition for our customers and business partners.
Our Commitments to Each Other
We appreciate the loyalty our customers have shown to Discover over the years, and we are committed to demonstrating that loyalty goes both ways. That’s why we are so focused on connecting our customers with the future— and doing our part to ensure that their financial future is bright.
One of the keys to a brighter future is financial literacy, and Discover has been recognized for its efforts to bring financial education to high school classrooms. Our flagship initiative is Pathway to Financial Success, a five- year, $10 million commitment to bring financial education to our nation’s high schools, and so far we have provided grants to more than 900 public schools and districts covering all 50 states. As a result, Discover was named “Organization of the Year – Corporate Leadership” by the Institute for Financial Literacy.

  Pathway to Financial Success is just one aspect of our commitment to being a good corporate citizen. Discover employees also volunteered more than 50,000 hours of time and we donated millions of dollars to thousands of non-profit organizations in 2014. I thank Discover employees for their generous spirit and for their commitment to Discover, our customers and our communities.
Finally, I want to recognize the Discover Board of Directors. Our Board includes executives who have led major corporations, as well as individuals with broad knowledge of the U.S. economy and financial services. Discover operates in a heavily regulated industry and our directors agree to serve knowing that it will be a demanding job. Accordingly, I want to thank our Board for its counsel and guidance as we seek to connect our customers— and Discover—with the future.
