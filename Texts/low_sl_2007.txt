SHAREHOLDERS
would like to begin by acknowledging what is obvious to those who followed the company's results over the past year: 2007 presented a very difficult sales environment for Lowe's and the home improvement industry. With more than 60 years of retail experience, we have weathered many cycles, but frankly, WITH MORE THAN 60 YEARS OF RETAIL EXPERIENCE, WE HAVE WEATHERED MANY CYCLES. we were ready to close the books on 2007. The year was marked by unprecedented softening of the housing market as a rapid decline in housing turnover pressured home prices in many areas of the United States and consumers reduced home improvement spending. In addition, tightened mortgage lending standards and reduced credit availability in the back half of the year affected consumers' access to capital and further impacted our sales. We saw dramatic regional differences in our sales as the dynamics of the housing market varied widely across the United States. Markets like California and Florida that experienced the biggest declines in home prices and the most pronounced slowdown in housing turnover delivered our worst relative sales results. While routine home maintenance continued in most markets, consumers acted cautiously regarding discretionary purchases and were hesitant to begin big-ticket projects, especially in the most pressured markets. And, if that weren't enough, unseasonable weather, including exceptional drought in certain areas of the United States, exacerbated an already challenging sales environment.

IN A CHALLENGING SALES ENVIRONMENT, STRONG COMPANIES LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO GAIN STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES AND CAPTURE MARKET SHARE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DID IN 2007.

Certainly, a long list of factors affected our industry and led to disappointing sales results for the year, but, in a challenging sales environment, strong companies look for opportunities to gain strategic advantages and capture market share. That is exactly what we did in 2007. Our total sales fell short of our expectations, but, in a year when relative performance was as important as absolute results, we gained 80 basis points of total unit market share in calendar 2007, according to third-party estimates. I want to thank our more than 215,000 employees whose customer focus allowed us to capture market share. Those share gains, combined with appropriate expense management in a very challenging environment for the home improvement industry, allowed us to deliver respectable earnings for the year. Additional highlights from 2007 include the opening of our first store in Vermont. We have broadened our reach and now have stores in all 50 states. We also celebrated a major milestone in our Company's history when we successfully opened our first stores outside the United States in the Greater Toronto Area. We are excited to be serving home improvement consumers in these vibrant markets.

WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON WHAT WE CAN CONTROL: PROVIDING GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE WHILE MANAGING EXPENSES AND CAPITAL SPENDING WHILE OFFERING CUSTOMERS THE BEST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE IN HOME IMPROVEMENT.

Unfortunately, as we look to 2008, the external pressures facing our industry will likely persist, and the sales environment remains challenging. We are working to further understand the external drivers of our industry, but our ability to predict when these factors will shift in our favor is limited. We will continue to monitor the structural drivers of demand, including housing turnover, homeownership rates, relative home prices, employment and real disposable personal income as well as consumer sentiment related to home improvement, but, in the end, we remain focused on what we can control: providing great customer service while managing expenses and capital spending while offering customers the best shopping experience in home improvement. We remain passionate about customer service. Knowledgeable and engaged employees, ready to assist customers with their home maintenance and improvement needs, are a competitive advantage. We work to enhance that advantage through ongoing training to sharpen selling, product knowledge and customer service skills in order to maintain our sales culture. We continue to identify ways to enhance our already strong product offering and work to ensure customers have a great shopping experience in our best-in-class stores. Our stores feature great displays and easy-to-understand signage that provide customers the information needed to complete routine maintenance and inspire them to tackle new projects. We're working closely with our product vendors to offer customers what we've termed "Innovation at a value." Innovation has historically come with a price, but this initiative strives to provide customers with innovative and inspirational products at all points in the price continuum.

LOWE'S 2007 ANNUAL REPORT

We continue to expand our company, and we plan to open 120 stores in the United States and Canada in fiscal 2008. While this is down from the 153 stores we opened in 2007, our long-term view of the industry has not materially changed. We continue to see the opportunity to operate between 2,400 and 2,500 Lowe's stores in North America. SUCCESS WILL BE DEFINED BY OUR ABILITY TO CAPTURE PROFITABLE MARKET SHARE AND APPROPRIATELY MANAGE EXPENSES AND CAPITAL SPENDING WHILE DELIVERING THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN THE INDUSTRY. In summary, 2007 was a difficult year, and 2008 will likely remain tough. When you think about it, we're really fighting a battle on two fronts. We're working to maximize results in the challenging environment we face over the next several quarters while, at the same time, positioning the company for the longer-term opportunities ahead. Despite the best efforts of our employees, success in 2008 will look very different than in years past. Several years of comparable store sales growth leading up to this difficult sales period will again give way to comparable store sales declines in 2008, our ability to leverage expenses in this environment will be challenged and earnings are forecasted to decline. In such an environment, success will be defined by our ability to capture profitable market share and appropriately manage expenses and capital spending while delivering the best customer service in the industry. Key to that success is an engaged and inspired workforce that maximizes our competitive advantages and positions Lowe's for long-term growth. My commitment to you as a customer, employee or shareholder is that we will use all of Lowe's experience to make decisions that ensure we win the battle on both fronts and maximize returns. Thank you for your continued support of Lowe's. Sincerely,

Robert A. Niblock Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer
