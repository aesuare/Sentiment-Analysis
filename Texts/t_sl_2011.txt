To our investors:
Five years ago, we committed AT&T to a future of leadership and growth in the most transformative technology of our time — the mobile Internet.
   We made that commitment knowing the potential was enormous — for customers, for society, for our economy and for our shareowners. And I am proud to say that, from the start, your company has led the way.
As bold as our vision was, and as fast as we’ve already grown, it’s now clear that the mobile Internet revolution is exceeding everyone’s expectations. Think about all that we’ve seen in just five short years:
• Smartphone adoption has soared — with more than 1 billion already sold worldwide, and mobile tablets and eReaders are now on a similar growth trajectory.
• Mobile applications that make smartphones and tablets even smarter have exploded; last year alone an estimated 12 billion were downloaded worldwide, up 10X over the past five years.
• To stay ahead of this tidal wave, AT&T and other providers have invested aggressively, deploying new generations of network technology in rapid succession — from 2G to 3G and now to 4G.
• Innovation has exploded across this high- growth ecosystem, and it continues to accelerate — encompassing network providers, device makers, app developers and customers.
This is without question one of the largest, fastest technology waves in history. As a result, how we live and do business is being reimagined at breakneck speed.
• The mobile Internet has made virtually everything more immediate and effortless — shopping, financial transactions, games, entertainment, social networking and more.

• Five years ago, smartphones were mainly about email and messaging. Today, they possess amazing computing power with sensors, video cameras, music players, GPS capabilities and much more — to serve as a hub and give
us instant access to the entire Internet and unprecedented control over our lives.
• Every industry is tapping into these capabilities to create new business models, reinvent their operations and improve productivity.
• And we’re just beginning to realize the potential of this mobile revolution to accelerate commerce and drive human progress — bringing step-change improvements to everything from education to healthcare to energy.
AT&T has set the pace, delivering the mobile Internet to more customers than any other U.S. provider. Over the past five years:
• We invested more than $115 billion into our operations and into acquiring spectrum and other assets that have enhanced our wireless and wired networks. Since 2006, AT&T has invested more capital into the U.S. economy than any other public company.
• Mobile data traffic on our network grew more than 20,000 percent, more than doubling in 2011 alone.
• Mobile data speeds on our network increased dramatically. The download speeds available on our 4G LTE network today are more than 50X faster than our 2G network five years ago.
• The number of smartphones, tablets and other advanced mobile Internet devices on our network soared to more than 43 million.
• Total mobile data connections on our network more than doubled to more than 74 million, and mobile data revenues increased 5X, from just over $4 billion to more than $22 billion.
• Our total wireless subscribers grew nearly 70 percent to 103 million, and our wireless
revenues increased 68 percent.
These numbers say that your company is leading a transformative wave of innovation and growth. And what’s most gratifying is how we built on that leadership position in 2011:
• We were again No. 1 among U.S. providers in mobile subscribers added — 7.7 million — and tops in virtually every key mobile-data-growth metric, including smartphone penetration and connected devices such as tablets and eReaders.
• We added more than 10 million smartphones to our network, and we closed the year with smartphones making up better than eight out of 10 new contract device sales, well above our industry-leading penetration rate.
• We exceeded our targets in every major mobile network initiative, enabling us to deliver a premier mobile Internet experience with best-in-class speeds.

                                               • We ended 2011 with 80 percent of our mobile data traffic running on our advanced 4G network, and AT&T’s network lets iPhone 4S download 3X faster than our competitors.
• And now we’re well under way with our rollout of the fastest, most advanced technology — 4G LTE — with plans to complete our deployment to 80 percent of the U.S. population by the end of 2013.
• We also significantly expanded our advanced capabilities for business customers — whose requirements are increasingly focused on mobile broadband connectivity — by creating a robust Internet cloud services platform for computing, storage, security and mobile apps.
And as we built these new growth platforms, we also delivered solid financial results. In 2011:
• Revenues from mobile data and advanced business services both grew at a strong double-digit pace, and our total revenues increased to a record $126.7 billion.
• Cash from operating activities was a strong $34.6 billion.
• We invested more than $20 billion of capital in our networks.
• We also paid more than $10 billion to our shareowners in dividends, and at the end of the year we announced our 28th consecutive annual dividend increase.
• This places your company among a select group of large, blue-chip companies with an exemplary record of consistent performance while returning increased value directly to shareowners.
• And in January 2012, we announced that we would immediately begin repurchasing shares under our existing 300 million share authorization. That’s about 5 percent of our shares outstanding, representing approximately $9 billion based on our stock price at the time of this letter. Our strong cash generation gives us the flexibility to execute these buybacks while maintaining a sound balance sheet.

Rapid transitions to our new technology platforms — especially at the scale and speed we’re seeing with mobile broadband — inevitably result in creative disruption, as new and better capabilities replace legacy services and drive economic growth.
• The essence of our business has always been to lead the way in this process — to get to the future first — so that our customers and our shareowners benefit.
• And in our own operations, this has driven significant changes in our business mix.
• Five years ago, wireless, wireline data and managed services represented roughly half of our overall revenues. Today, they account for more than three-fourths of the total, and in 2011 they had combined growth of
7.5 percent, showing considerable strength in a slow economy.
• Meanwhile, other parts of our operations — most notably our print directory business and voice-centered fixed-line consumer services — continue to decline as customers migrate from legacy technologies to newer platforms.
• These declines were reflected in the noncash charges we took in the fourth quarter of 2011; we wrote down the value of our directory
business to reflect peer values and made actuarial adjustments to our benefit plans, which were predominantly associated with our legacy operations’ employees and retirees.
We expect this shift in our business to accelerate as we drive further mobile broadband growth and make strategic decisions to improve our overall growth profile.
• The gap between our growth businesses and our legacy operations continues to widen. That makes evaluating the best options for our low- growth and nonstrategic assets a top priority.
• Meanwhile, we recognize that as swift and pervasive as the mobile Internet revolution has been, we’re still early in the growth trajectory.
• So our dominant strategic focus will continue to be acquiring the spectrum and building the network capabilities we need for robust growth as the mobile Internet enters its next stage.
To advance that strategy, we undertook a major strategic initiative in 2011: our proposed acquisition of Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile USA unit.
• This transaction was the right move at the right time because it would have increased overall network capacity at a pivotal time in

our industry’s development — as the mobile Internet continues to disrupt yesterday’s technologies and business models.
• Our two companies’ compatible network technologies and spectrum holdings made this a unique opportunity — one that would have allowed us to greatly expand our nationwide deployment of the most advanced 4G LTE network technology to more small towns and rural communities.
• In the end, we weren’t successful; the transaction was opposed by the Federal Communications Commission and the Department of Justice, resulting in breakup payments reflected in the $4 billion charge we took in the fourth quarter.
• But the transaction served to dramatize the No. 1 forward-looking issue for our industry — making enough spectrum available to keep up with customer demand and enable the mobile Internet revolution to reach its full potential.
Customer demand for the mobile Internet continues to rise.
• Over the next five years, on top of the
20,000 percent growth we’ve experienced since 2006, we conservatively expect our mobile data traffic to grow more than 8X from today’s levels — as more powerful networks connected to the cloud take hold and supercharge the next phase of the mobile revolution.
• This means spectrum availability is crucial for our customers, and it’s the critical public policy issue for our industry.
• That’s why we will continue to provide leadership on this issue and advocate for equal opportunities to acquire spectrum as soon as possible, both on the open market and through open auctions.
Meanwhile, we’re not waiting around. We are leading the way on a number of fronts to help increase network capacity and mobile broadband accessibility while we continue to pursue additional spectrum.
• We’ve executed a number of smaller spectrum transactions.
• We’ve worked aggressively to add cell sites and make the most of existing spectrum.
• We’ve taken the initiative to help manage existing capacity responsibly through usage- based mobile data pricing and by managing the speeds of the highest-volume unlimited users. We want to ensure a better overall experience for all of our users.
• Now, we’re accelerating deployment of 4G LTE technology. In addition to providing stunning speeds, this most advanced network technology provides a lift in network efficiency of roughly 30 to 40 percent over our current technology. But as impressive as this capacity lift is, with current rates of traffic growth, it’s only a near-term help.
As dramatic as the first five years in the mobile broadband revolution have been, the next five years will surpass them by an order of magnitude ...

• We also continue to pursue Wi-Fi as an alternative access strategy. We’ve assembled the United States’ largest Wi-Fi network to provide our customers with alternative mobile access points, and growth has been dramatic. For the full year 2008, customers made
20 million Wi-Fi connections on our network. Last year, we hit that total every four days.
Adding capacity and expanding accessibility are critically important because the mobile Internet is on the verge of radically improving our lives and our economy.
• As dramatic as the first five years of the mobile broadband revolution have been, the next five years will surpass them by an order of magnitude.
• Why? Because our networks now provide super-high-speed connectivity to a virtually unlimited amount of content and number of applications that live in the Internet cloud.
• This is an incredibly dynamic combination, and it will spark the next wave of innovation and growth.
• Everything will be more connected, easier and more intelligent, as smartphones and tablets — where we lead the industry — serve as the hub of each person’s mobile universe.
• This next chapter in the mobile revolution will be about much more than what we can do on our devices; it will be all about how the mobile Internet improves every aspect of our lives.

• We’ll be able to remotely monitor every kind of machine and function — security and entertainment systems, air conditioners, water heaters, sprinklers and more — giving us unprecedented control over usage and costs.
• Sensors connected to our wireless network will revolutionize healthcare. Parents will be able to monitor their babies’ health through sensors in infant clothing. Heart rate, blood pressure and other vital signs can be transmitted automatically to doctors for real-time diagnostics and alerts plus seamless record-keeping. This technology can help a growing number of seniors live more securely and independently at home.
• Cars will become smart devices — monitoring their own systems, alerting us before parts malfunction, avoiding traffic jams and delivering entertainment from the cloud to the kids in the back seat.
• In these and countless other ways, millions and millions of wirelessly connected machines will work harder and smarter, making our lives easier, safer and more productive.
This is the future of the mobile Internet — we’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible — and we will continue to build AT&T’s future at the center of this revolution.
• That’s where we are investing for growth.
• It’s also where we are focusing our work with the global ecosystem of app developers, to bring more innovation onto our network faster.
• And you can count on us to stay disciplined and aggressive in our pursuit of these opportunities.
We’re also committed to another kind of investment, one that’s simply part of who we are as a company.
• We will continue to invest in the future of our communities, with a strong emphasis on high school retention and workforce readiness.
• In 2008, we launched AT&T Aspire, a
$100 million initiative to support and expand programs with a demonstrated track record of improving educational outcomes.
• Through the end of 2011, we exceeded our targets to support projects focused on this objective, and in early 2012, we plan to launch a major expansion of AT&T Aspire.
• A skilled workforce and an educated, productive society are keys to our nation’s health and our company’s long-term success.
Every day, on all these fronts, our mission is to help our customers, our communities and our country get to the future first — bringing to life all that technology makes possible. It’s a responsibility and a commitment we embrace.
Our achievements in this regard are a tribute to AT&T’s employees around the world. During a time of grinding economic pressures and historic industry transition, they have kept their focus and executed extremely well. I know you join me in expressing gratitude and respect for their work. On their behalf, I thank you for your continued confidence and support. Together, we will work tirelessly to continue leading the mobile Internet revolution.
Sincerely,
