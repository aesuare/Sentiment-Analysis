EMCOR continues to deliver for its customers, employees and shareholders. 26,000 dedicated employees who focus on execution and results make EMCOR a special company. EMCOR thrives when we bring our disciplined and a resultsorientated approach to the thousands of service and installation opportunities we execute for our customers every year. This annual report shows the breadth and depth of EMCOR as we serve customers and sectors as diverse as refineries, healthcare, retail, commercial offices, military, power plants and data centers across this nation in the most demanding environments and circumstances. Our successful execution of project and service opportunities for these demanding customers positions us for future growth across all our businesses and markets served. We work every day to earn our customers' trust and, as a result, their business.

Our disciplined and results-orientated approach shows through in our safety record, our financial results and our commitment to the character and competence of our leaders. EMCOR has an industry leading safety record. It is our ethos to provide a safe environment for our employees. We have an industry leading recordable incident rate of 1.32 an improvement of 3 fold from 10 years ago. Our hours worked have increased from 51.9 million to 57.5 million over the last 10 years but our number of recordable injuries has dropped from 1,197 to 380. We never expect our skilled tradespeople

to execute a task without the right training, right leadership and the correct equipment. We will never stop until we have zero recordable injuries -- we do not accept that "injuries just sometimes happen." Our front-line supervision owns our safety results and this focus builds from them to our local CEOs and business unit leadership and ends with our Board and me. Our 2012 financial results show the success we have had in growing earnings and generating growth in this challenging environment. In 2012, we generated operating margins of 3.9 percent and grew revenues by 13.1 percent. Our cash flow of $184.4 million at 126 percent of net income shows that despite strong growth we can

still manage our balance sheet in a disciplined and responsible manner. We have an industry leading margin of 6.4 percent in our construction business. Our EFS business grew by 14.3 percent and improved operating earnings by 19.1 percent. Our EFS operating margins improved from 3.4 to 3.6 percent but this slight improvement masks a very strong improvement in the second half of the year as margins expanded by 200 basis points to 4.6 percent from the first half of 2012. We are not satisfied by this performance in EFS and expect to realize 5 percent operating margins on a sustained basis if current market conditions continue and we continue to have success in EFS' Industrial Service business. We hope to accomplish this result in the next 18 months.

We want to build the best leaders at EMCOR and have embarked on a journey to train them through our vigorous Leadership and Ethics program. I will lead the top 200 leaders of EMCOR through an intensive 3-day training program with the Thayer Leader Development Group at West Point. We have already trained 100 people and the results are encouraging. Our goal is to have our people led by individuals with the highest competence and character. Our focus is on re-grounding our executives in the fundamentals of successful leadership. We want strong local, regional and national leaders who do not take shortcuts and lead our people well. This has been key to our past success and serves as a cornerstone of our future success. Skilled and entrepreneurial leaders make EMCOR what it is today and are fundamental to our long-term ability to build value for our owners. We appreciate the confidence you show in us by choosing EMCOR as one of your investments. We will work hard to continue to reward your confidence.
