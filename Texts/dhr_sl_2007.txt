        Dear Fellow Shareholder:
Danaher had another terrific year in 2007. Revenues from continuing operations increased 16.5% and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 19%. We strengthened our portfolio organically and expanded our key strategic platforms with 12 acquisitions that in the aggregate added over
$1.5 billion of new revenue for Danaher. The Danaher team performed well in 2007, and I am proud of and thankful for their efforts.
2007 Milestones
Of particular importance, Danaher achieved three major milestones in 2007:
• Revenues exceeded $10 billion
• More than 50% of revenues are now generated outside of the United States
• Free cash flow exceeded $1.5 billion
As a result of these achievements, we entered 2008 not only larger but stronger and more global than ever. The evolution of Danaher continues and this report highlights various aspects of that evolution which we believe bode well for our future performance. Evolution, like kaizen, is by nature continuous. Danaher has come a long way since I first joined the company, but our evolution is far from finished.
DBS Evolution
As a result of our early study of the Toyota Production System, the Danaher Business System (DBS) has evolved from its roots on the manufacturing floor to a comprehensive approach, driving customer satisfaction and growth through

 innovation and continuous improvement in all aspects of the business. Representing a truly global process today, DBS is utilized by every operating location, function and level at Danaher to shape strategy, focus execution and create value for customers and shareholders alike.
We have put tremendous energy and investment into our Ideas to Execution (I2E) initiative, aimed at strengthening the processes by which we conceive, develop and deliver new products to our customers. Essentially, I2E is DBS for our engineers, scientists, marketers and salespeople. We have borrowed heavily from the lean principles of DBS and imported them into these functions. Plus, we have internally and externally benchmarked best practices for research, development, sales and marketing that we can share across Danaher.
Our recent launch of AQT90 Flex, Radiometer’s entry platform into the cardiac marker market, is proof I2E works. We used our cost-oriented DBS tools to free up funding for this ambitious undertaking, the largest R&D project in Radiometer’s history. We then used the I2E tools to collect customer inputs, develop and test a winning product design and deliver it in record time. We began shipping AQT90 Flex earlier this year and now can look to tap this new $1 billion industry segment for incremental growth.
The well-above market growth rates at Hach-Lange, our water quality analytics business, are further evidence of how we are successfully expanding DBS. Hach-Lange utilized I2E to systematically improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our sales teams and then, with those improvements in-hand, smartly expanded our field sales capacity to drive double-digit compounded annual revenue growth over the past five years.
DBS is everywhere and will continue to evolve to stay relevant and impact the daily work of everyone at Danaher.
Portfolio Evolution
Our portfolio certainly evolved in 2007 with 12 important additions. We continue to believe that investing our free cash flow in leadership businesses with strong prospects for revenue and profit growth creates long-term value for shareholders. Tektronix, a global leader in Test & Measurement (T&M), brought another outstanding global brand to Danaher and doubled the size of one of our strongest strategic platforms. In partnership with Fluke and Fluke Networks, Tektronix is expected to build on its legacy of developing outstanding products for the R&D engineer to accelerate growth in its served markets.
We are off to an excellent start with the Tektronix team and are bullish about our future together in T&M.

                                               The addition of Vision Systems was another key move as we continue to build a strong position in Life Sciences. We combined Vision with a division of Leica Microsystems to create Leica Biosystems, a leading supplier of workflow solutions for clinical histopathology laboratories and a business with strong growth prospects and a balanced instrument and consumable revenue mix. Our customers here are on the front lines of cancer diagnostics and treatment, utilizing our highly reliable, quick turnaround products to enhance patient care and clinical outcomes.
Global Evolution
Our geographic footprint evolved last year, as our organic expansion in the faster growing economies of Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin and South America and the Middle East accelerated. In 2007, Danaher’s core revenues grew at a double-digit rate in these emerging markets, which now represent approximately 15% of Danaher’s sales. And with the addition of Tektronix, more than 50% of Danaher’s revenues come from markets outside of the U.S. China alone is a $1 billion business for us — larger than the Danaher I joined in 1990. We have shared with you before our vision of becoming a premier global enterprise. We are clearly making progress, yet still see plenty of opportunity for further expansion and growth ahead.
Final Thoughts
Danaher evolves almost daily, but certain things stay the same. Our five core values are steadfast. Our focus on performance, especially free cash flow, is another constant. Our free cash flow has compounded at 20% annually over the last five years and for 16 years in a row has exceeded our net income.
Consumer and credit market turmoil suggests uncertainty ahead in the U.S. while our international markets remain stable. We aim to outperform in 2008 regardless of the economic environment in which we operate. The evolution of Danaher — in DBS, our portfolio and our geographic footprint — positions us well for the future. We expect that evolution will continue as we grow and strengthen your company.
                                                                                                Thank you for your confidence and support.
