A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN
To Our Shareholders, Employees, Customers, and Vendors:
Year 2000
Looking back at our excellent results during the year 2000, demand from our customers reached record highs in practically all of our product areas, resulting in shortages of many of our components in the market place. Our sales reached $2,465,066,000 and our net earnings were $517,864,000 (21% net return on sales); earnings per share were $3.77.
Demand was fueled primarily by growth in the wireless communications market, as well as growth in other major market sectors. Annual global shipments of cell phones increased from 110 million units in 1997 to 283 million units in 1999 and to 405 million units in 2000. This represented a 43% increase in shipments of cell phones in 2000 compared to 1999. At the same time, the number of passive components per phone continued to increase. As a result of this strong demand, our bookings (orders) were $2.8 billion in 2000, a 40% increase over 1999, and annual sales approached $2.5 billion.
Our passive components business, which represented 66% of total Company sales in 2000, had outstanding results, with gross margins of 42% as compared to 22% in 1999. Our semiconductor business, consisting of Siliconix and Telefunken, which represented 34% of total Company sales in 2000, also had outstanding results, with gross margins of 39% as compared to 32% in 1999.
During the year, we strengthened the Company with four small acquisitions which in total will add approximately $70 million annually to our sales and be accretive to earnings in 2001. These four acquisitions were:
• Electro-Films, Inc.: a technology leader in the manufac- ture of thin-film components and networks on ceramic and silicon, including resistors, capacitors, inductors, and microwave components.
• Cera-Mite Corporation: a worldwide supplier of ceramic disc capacitors and thermistors. Cera-Mite is known for its excellence in the technology of ceramic materials.
• Spectrol: a manufacturer of sensing transducer-type potentiometers used primarily in the automotive industry, and trimmer potentiometers used in various types of electronic circuitry.
• Tansitor: the leading manufacturer of wet tantalum electrolytic capacitors used for military applications, and miniature conformal coated solid tantalum capacitors used for hearing aids.
During 2000, we also sold our 65% participation in Lite-On Power Semiconductor Corporation (LPSC) and realized a pretax gain of $8.4 million. We decided to exit this joint venture due to the unsatisfactory performance of this partnership.
Recently, we made an offer to purchase the 19.6% of Siliconix in public hands at a price of $28.82 per share.
Financial Highlights
For the year ended December 31, 2000, sales were $2,465,066,000, compared to $1,760,091,000 in the previous year, an increase of 40.0%. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $517,864,000 or $3.77 per share (diluted), compared to $83,237,000 or $0.65 per share (diluted) in the previous year, an increase of 522.2%.
Earnings per share amounts for both periods reflect a 3-for- 2 stock split paid June 9, 2000.
Gross profits for the year ended December 31, 2000 were 40.8% of net sales, compared to 26.2% in the prior year. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 12.1% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to 14.5% of sales in the prior year. This resulted in operating income reaching $696,498,000 or 28.3% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $193,744,000 or 11.0% of net sales in the prior year, an increase of 260%.

The Company generated substantial cash during the year 2000, resulting in the Company being in the strongest financial condition in its history. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Company’s cash flow from opera- tions was $542,319,000, compared to cash flow from operations of $239,547,000 in the prior year. Purchases of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $229,781,000 as compared to $119,638,000 in the prior year.
In addition, in May 2000, the Company completed a successful secondary public offering by selling 8,392,500 shares of its common stock, with net proceeds to the Company of $395 million. The Company used these proceeds and free cash generated from operations to repay the debt outstanding under its long-term revolving credit facility. Our cash balance at December 31, 2000 was $337,000,000 and long-term debt was $140,000,000, resulting in a net cash position of $197,000,000 ... our best balance sheet ever.
Looking Ahead
The year 2001 industry environment involves revised sales forecasts of end products such as cellular telephones and computers. The business environment for some of our customers (producers of cell phones and computers) therefore involves reduction in supplies of electronic components, which is our business.
While the year 2000 was very good for Vishay, as evidenced by our historically high results, 2001 will be a time for adjustment. We hope that this period of adjustment, characterized by customer inventory reductions, reductions in market demand, and order cancellations, will be tempo- rary. However, this lower market profile will provide new opportunities for Vishay to leverage its strong financial position and aggressively pursue new acquisitions. We believe that Vishay’s acquisition strategy, new product development, and continuing cost reduction measures, together with improving industry conditions by the end of 2001 as predicted by many industry sources, will benefit the Company and its shareholders.
Vishay has a cash
surplus of
$197,000,000 in
excess of its long-
term debt, and
almost $2 billion in
equity. This puts
Vishay in a position
to grow through
acquisitions and
take advantage of
any softening in
economic conditions that temporarily decreases the prices of Vishay’s potential acquisition targets. During past industry downturns, Vishay generally has done better than competing companies and has emerged stronger than ever. We are poised to acquire businesses in the active and passive component markets that will further strengthen Vishay. This is consistent with Vishay’s historic ability to maintain a competitive edge throughout economic cycles. In the year 2001 and beyond, we will continue to build on our position as a leader in the U.S., European, and Asian electronics markets.
We are extremely grateful to our employees worldwide for their loyalty, skill, and energy which has contributed significantly to our growth. We value highly the relationship we have with our customers and suppliers. To our fellow shareholders, we thank you for your continued confidence in Vishay. We look forward to meeting the challenges ahead.
Sincerely,
Felix Zandman
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer April 2001
