2011 ANNUAL REPORT
 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
2011 was a year of transformation and change. At the beginning of the year, we challenged ourselves and our team to push the organization forward, building on GameStop’s longstanding entrepreneurial and innovative culture. We are confident we delivered with several steps in 2011, including strategic acquisitions and key digital and mobile gaming initiatives that position us strongly
for the future.
Early in the year, we executed our digital growth strategy with two important acquisitions: streaming technology company Spawn Labs and digital distribution service Impulse. These new technologies uniquely position GameStop to be the leader not only in the physical gaming space, but also in the digital delivery of video games. Later in the year, we took aggressive steps to enter the mobile space, selling a selection of Android tablets and accepting trades of iPod®, iPhone® and iPad® devices. Using our refurbishment expertise, we began offering pre-owned iDevices in select stores. With the success of these mobile initiatives, it became clear that this is a natural fit for GameStop’s future growth.
Throughout our history, we have remained agile and responsive to the evolving video game industry. From entering the pre-owned business and acquiring EB Games, to investing in PC game downloads with Impluse, we have refused to become complacent. As we continually reinvent ourselves to meet the changing needs of our customers, we remain committed to our core business of video gaming and believe that we are well positioned to take GameStop into the future.
On behalf of our board, executive leadership team and our 40,000+ team members worldwide, we thank you for your continued support of GameStop.
