To Our Shareholders
Demand for network services and IT solutions is dynamic and growing, as businesses increasingly view these technologies as strategic enablers of growth and improved performance. Seeking greater agility and flexibility, businesses of all sizes are demanding more standardized, modular solutions and emerging "as-a-service" offerings. Similarly, consumers are demanding more reliable, higher-bandwidth, broadband-enabled communications and entertainment services. CenturyLink possesses the high-bandwidth infrastructure, comprehensive service portfolio and attentive customer support to meet the growing demands of our customers. In 2013, we strengthened our competitive position by enhancing our network and data center assets, expanding our cloud capabilities and enlarging our sales organizations. We also took aggressive steps to adapt to market conditions, including acquiring two leading-edge cloud-based companies, AppFog, Inc. and Tier 3, Inc., and launching our first 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) fiber service. These investments significantly enhanced our cloud-services platform and demonstrated the power of fiber-enabled networks to drive customer demand. Businesses and consumers responded positively to our efforts in 2013, as we generated strong growth in our strategic revenues and broadband subscriber base. While our data hosting results fell short of our expectations, that business did see growth during the year. These results reinforce our confidence that execution of our network, data hosting and consumer broadband growth strategies put us on track for improved revenue performance in 2014 and beyond. As we move into 2014, we remain focused on enabling our customers to take advantage of an expanding array of products and services to strengthen their businesses and improve their lives. Strengthening Businesses CenturyLink's global network, hosting and managed services enable businesses to operate with greater agility and reliability. Our business customers are responding positively to the value of our consolidated service offerings. Coupled with our attentive support, customers can focus on what matters most ­ growing their businesses. In 2013, for the second year running, our IP-enabled network revenues increased more than four percent, driven principally by Ethernet and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) growth. We also increased the sale of data hosting services to our existing network customers at a healthy pace throughout the year, and we expect continued momentum in 2014. We connected our first 100 Gbps Optical Wavelength service customer in 2013 and gained our first state government cloud-services customer. We also introduced a new IT service and consulting product offering in 2013. Customers have responded positively to this offering, looking to CenturyLink to assist them with their conversion to cloud-enabled network environments. In addition to offering revenue opportunities in its own right, this line of business enables us to truly partner with our customers' key network and IT decision-makers to solve their full range of network and IT needs.

Meeting Deadlines

Delivering Mission-Critical Reliability

Providing Cloud Solutions

John Avenson Vice President, Technology Minnesota Twins Baseball Club, Minneapolis, MN "We recently faced many challenges while bringing up a brand new converged network at our spring training facility. CenturyLink provided layered resolution through its professional and flexible attention. Despite the familiar, constant battle with time ­ and in the midst of a very active construction site ­ our CenturyLink partners worked to get us where we needed to be in time for our spring training home opener. It was a moment where we literally beat the clock. While our team won the game on the field, CenturyLink was clearly a winner, too. "

John Rooney Vice President of Information Services Shelter Insurance, Columbia, MO "At Shelter Insurance, we need to be available when our customers need us most ­ at the time of a claim. More and more, service to our customers is enhanced by technology. Shelter Insurance relies on CenturyLink for our critical network connectivity to enable our employees and agents to deliver our promise every day and in those times of need. "

Andrew Pipp Director IT Operations Center for Diagnostic Imaging, Minneapolis, MN "Center for Diagnostic Imaging's (CDI) networks are engineered to scale with the growing organization nationally, and at the core is CenturyLink's MPLS technology. This technology solution allows CDI and its affiliated partners to create robust networks to support clinical and patient communication, which are critical to its excellence in customer service and overall business goals. "

To Our Shareholders (cont.)
In the fourth quarter of 2013, we introduced our new Managed Office solution for small-to-mid-size businesses to offer customers the advantages of managed services in a flexible and scalable environment. Our Managed Office product is a bundled solution that includes managed network and hosted Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), managed hardware, hosted apps and cloud-based storage, security software and managed installation and training. Customers can buy Managed Office on a monthly price-per-employee basis, which benefits businesses of all sizes by making it easy to scale and predict communication costs. We are excited about the products and services we are able to deliver to our diverse set of business customers. Whether we are working with a global financial services provider to deliver complex network solutions and integrated cloud-enabled services, a large enterprise to provide IT services in connection with a cloud conversion or a small business to provision our Managed Office solution, CenturyLink has the full range of assets and capabilities to meet our customers' needs. Improving Lives As with our business customers, consumers are showing increasing interest in higher bandwidth speeds and more robust broadbandenabled products and services. CenturyLink is investing to enable consumers to take advantage of their broadband connection to make life easier and more enjoyable. Our efforts were rewarded as we saw strong growth in our consumer broadband business. We added 140,000 new high-speed Internet subscribers during 2013; a performance that we think was among the best in the industry. Recognizing consumers' desire for greater speeds, we deployed 1 Gbps service in select neighborhoods in Omaha, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. Early results in these deployments indicate excellent market penetration and significant positive impacts throughout the market. In addition, 69,000 new customers subscribed to our Prism TM TV service during the year. We launched Prism TM TV service in Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Omaha and a suburb of Denver during 2013. In addition, we further expanded the innovative applications we offer to consumers with the launch of Connected Home, our home security and automation service. We are very encouraged by consumer response to our investments to enable more robust speeds. We plan to continue to deploy these types of services with our disciplined investment approach. Driving Growth Through Strategic Investment We consistently invest in our business with a focus on enabling higher bandwidth, IP-based functionality and IT-driven services. We strive to listen to our customers to identify and develop innovations with the greatest potential to enable growth for businesses and enhance quality of life for consumers. In 2013, we broke ground on our Technology Center of Excellence adjacent to our corporate headquarters in Monroe, La., where we expect to bring together the right people and technologies to drive future innovation and growth. We also made progress during the year through continued investments in the following strategic initiatives. We expanded and enhanced our broadband capabilities. We added 6.7 terabits per second of capacity to our backbone network in 2013, ending the year with a total capacity of approximately 16 terabits per second. We improved broadband speed availability across our footprint and launched our first three 1 Gbps markets. We also continued our focused deployment of fiber to multi-tenant buildings, adding 1,000 fiber-fed buildings in 2013. During the year, we began work on network simplification efforts, which we expect to drive faster provisioning and better service for our customers. Additionally, CenturyLink may have the potential to bring broadband access to more than 680,000 unserved rural households following the finalization of the Federal Communication Commission's Connect America Funds (CAF) II program. However, it is still too early to determine the final outcome of the CAF II proceeding now before the FCC. We continue to expand our Prism TM TV footprint and grow our subscriber base. We plan to expand Prism TM TV service to 300,000 to 400,000 additional homes in 2014. We also continue to enhance entertainment and video features available to our Prism TM TV subscribers. For example, in 2013 we added TV Everywhere capabilities, enhanced our Video On Demand library and introduced new video packages such as our Prism TM TV Preferred package, which appeals to budget-conscious customers who want premium content. We also initiated a successful trial of wireless set-top boxes.

"In 2013, we strengthened our competitive position by enhancing our network and data center assets, expanding our cloud capabilities and enlarging our sales organizations. "
4 CenturyLink 2013 Annual Review

"We strive to listen to our customers to identify and develop innovations with the greatest potential to enable growth for businesses and enhance quality of life for consumers. "

We plan to expand fiber-to-the-tower builds to help drive longterm growth. We built fiber to 4,100 cell towers in 2013 and ended the year with more than 18,800 fiber-connected towers. In 2014, we plan to add another 3,000 to 3,500 towers. By the end of 2014, we will have deployed fiber to roughly 72 percent of the cell towers in our local-exchange service area, which will better position us to secure long-term data transport revenues from wireless carriers. We also design and engineer fiber-to-the-tower builds to maximize the number of potential new business customers passed by our fiber network, creating additional revenue growth opportunities. We expect to continue to invest in managed hosting and cloud services. We acquired AppFog, Inc. and Tier 3, Inc. in 2013 to enhance our platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) offerings. AppFog provides a reliable, scalable and fast platform for developing apps in the cloud, and Tier 3 provides a public, multi-tenant cloud platform and a related development roadmap that now form the foundation of our cloud development strategy. With the Tier 3 acquisition, we also opened our Cloud Development Center in Seattle, which is home to a large base of cloud-computing talent. In 2013, we expanded our partnership with VMware to provide businesses with a choice of services, and we continued to develop solutions relevant to IT decision-makers in areas such as automation, flexibility, agility, security and Big Data. We expanded our global data center footprint, adding new centers in London and Hong Kong and announcing new locations in Toronto and Minneapolis for 2014. In early 2014, we changed the name of our managed hosting and cloud services business from Savvis to CenturyLink Technology Solutions. We believe the CenturyLink Technology Solutions name better presents the combined value we deliver to businesses through our colocation, managed services, cloud and network offerings. Delivering Shareholder Value We strive to operate our business with financial discipline and transparency. In early 2013, we announced a new capital allocation strategy that reduced our quarterly dividend and authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $2 billion of outstanding stock over the two-year period ending Feb. 13, 2015. We believe this strategy enhanced our long-term ability to balance our multiple objectives of growing our business, honoring our debt and other financial obligations, and returning cash to shareholders, while reducing the number of outstanding shares and increasing the resulting free cash flow per share.

In 2013, we returned $2.89 billion to our shareholders in stock buybacks and dividend payments, which is greater than the amount we would have returned in 2013 under our previous dividend payout. We repurchased $1.59 billion in common stock during 2013, which represented approximately 79 percent of our February 2013 $2 billion stock repurchase program, and expect to complete the program in second quarter 2014. In February 2014, our Board of Directors approved a second 24-month stock repurchase program, authorizing the buyback of up to an additional $1 billion in common stock, which becomes effective upon the completion of the current $2 billion program. By the end of 2013, we achieved monthly annualized run-rate operating expense synergies of approximately $600 million from the integration of Qwest into CenturyLink, successfully completing an effort that began when the deal closed in April 2011. Effectively managing costs and achieving operating efficiencies are among CenturyLink's proven strengths and are vital to our ability to serve customers in dynamic, competitive markets. In other financial matters, we executed debt financings in 2013 at favorable rates to extend maturities, and maintain flexibility and access to liquidity. We also reached a definitive agreement resolving the litigation filed by the trustees in the KPNQwest bankruptcy proceeding in the Netherlands, which had been ongoing since 2010. The settlement amount of approximately 171 million is significantly below the  4.2 billion litigation claim. We begin 2014 with strong momentum. Our Managed Office solution and enhanced cloud hosting capabilities are resonating well with our business customers. Our 1 Gbps service and applications like Prism TM TV and Connected Home are reinforcing our reputation for innovation with consumers. We are confident in our strategies and our platform for growth, and we are clearly focused on helping our customers thrive in a broadband-enabled, data-driven, cloud-based world. We thank you, our shareholders, for your continued trust in CenturyLink, its management team and employees. We do not take this trust for granted. We work every day to earn your confidence and drive long-term value for your investment.
