Comerica
Incorporated Letter to Shareholders
I am pleased to report to you that the strategy we put in place two years ago is working. As a result of our sharp focus on the six key drivers of that strategy – growth, balance, relationships, risk management, accountability and diversity – and the intense determination of our colleagues to help customers succeed, we demonstrated solid financial performance in 2005.
    
  We are expanding in growing markets in California, Texas, Arizona and Florida, while maintaining our leadership position in Michigan. We continue to receive high scores in customer satisfaction surveys for all of our lines of business. We steadily improved our credit quality, continuing the positive trend that began in 2004. And we ranked in the top 50 companies for diversity by DiversityInc Magazine.
In 2005, we reported net income of $5.11 per diluted share, return on equity of 16.90 percent and return on assets of 1.64 percent.
During 2005 we returned excess capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs, with a total payout of 104 percent of earnings. Comerica has increased its annual dividend for 37 consecutive years.
Here is a review of our progress on each of the key drivers of our strategy.
GROWTH
In 2006, we will complete our three-year plan to open 50 new banking centers in strong growth markets, primarily in Texas and our Western Market, which includes California and Arizona.
While we won’t be in every location, we’ll be in the right locations to serve our target business, wealth management and retail customers.
    By the end of 2005, we opened 35 new banking centers, including 17 in California,
10 in Texas, six in Michigan and two in Arizona. In Michigan, we also consolidated some branches and refurbished others, as we continue to optimize our market-leading position there.
Expanding and improving our access points for customers is one part of our four-part strategy to grow The Retail Bank. The other parts include:
• Creating national platforms to assure we provide consistent, superior customer service and a strong product line in all of our markets;
• Energizing our sales efforts to enhance our customer relationships; and
• Applying technology to expand our capabilities to meet our customers’ financial
requirements quickly and efficiently.
Skilled, experienced teams of bankers who deliver on customer promise are critical to the success of our Retail strategy.
“We are expanding in growing markets in California, Texas, Arizona and Florida, while maintaining our leadership position in Michigan.”
 The Business Bank is growing steadily, particularly in Texas and California. We continue
to develop new products and services to enable our customers to be more efficient and to help them grow. For example, we offer prepaid debit cards to our corporate customers and to a number of states including Georgia, Utah and Virginia, to help reduce the expense of disbursing payroll to employees.
We are also developing a single web-based corporate banking portal through which business applications will flow, providing our customers with the customized information and tools they need to succeed. Called Comerica Business Connect, it’s a great example of the kind of innovation that will help us meet the growing online needs of our business customers.
And, we plan to open a new office in Shanghai, China, to better assist U.S. businesses – especially those in California – that are interested in building relationships with the Chinese manufacturing and consumer markets.
In 2005, the Wealth & Institutional Management Division underwent significant internal change to prepare to take advantage of the untapped potential for its products and services in our client base in all our markets.
A new organizational structure was put in place, as well as new compensation plans to better align individual and corporate success. Existing products were introduced to new markets, and new products were developed, including two new Comerica Securities’ accounts, the Private Client

   Investment Management Account (PCIM) and Managed Portfolio Solutions (MPS), to provide our customers with investment expertise that is responsive to their needs.
By virtually any measure, Munder Capital Management had an exceptional year in 2005. The relative performance of the firm’s investment products exceeded their benchmarks nearly across the board, with all of the firm’s diversified equity disciplines and all bond styles besting their industry yardsticks for the year. This superior investment performance is a primary reason for the firm’s significant increases in sales and asset growth in both the retail and institutional market groups in 2005.
BALANCE
To help us achieve consistent growth through all phases of a business cycle, we are diversifying our earnings mix by business segment and geographic market.
The markets outside of the Midwest contributed approximately 46 percent of the net income from our geographic markets for 2005, and our strategy is to continue to grow that number.
Today, Comerica operates in seven of the 11 largest cities in the United States: Los Angeles, Houston, Phoenix, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose and Detroit. According to U.S. Census Bureau projections, two-thirds of all Americans will live in the southern and western United States by 2030, with 30 percent in just three states – California, Texas and Florida.
The market diversification strategy put in place more than 10 years ago is working. As states’ economies fluctuate, this strategy helps to balance the impact of an economy that is not performing as well as others.
We’re also making the investments necessary to balance our net income by line of business.
For 2005, The Retail Bank and Wealth & Institutional Management segments provided 29 percent of the net income from our business segments. We want to grow that percentage by cross-selling our personal and wealth management products and services to our existing customers, particularly our business customers, as well as by developing new customer relationships.
RELATIONSHIPS
This is our competitive edge, our core strength. Colleagues in all three divisions – The Business Bank, The Retail Bank, and Wealth & Institutional Management – are focused on building and enhancing relationships with customers. And they’re doing it right: according to customer satisfaction survey scores in all of our lines of business, our ability to build and retain customer relationships is high.
Customers appreciate the fact that we are offering the products and capabilities of a large bank with the service of a community bank. They appreciate the accessibility of our officers and their long tenure at Comerica. Our customers tell us we are professional, and we inspire their trust and confidence.
This is the culture we take with us when we enter new markets.

  RISK MANAGEMENT
The five “pillars” of risk are credit, market and liquidity, operational, compliance, and business risk, the last of which is made up of reputational and strategic risk. In 2005, there were a number of significant accomplishments related to risk management.
For example, our credit quality was at an historically strong level, as measured by any metric.
We developed a number of processes that will protect Comerica and its customers: Third-Party Risk, which helps colleagues working with outside vendors identify and monitor the risks involved in those business relationships; Anti-Money Laundering, to ensure that we have strong anti-money laundering procedures in place to meet or exceed regulatory agency expectations; and Privacy, to ensure that all colleagues understand the requirements of privacy and consumer protection laws.
ACCOUNTABILITY
Because execution is one of the most important components of any business model, we are continually developing and updating the metrics by which we measure our results and hold ourselves accountable.
Each division has specific scorecards to monitor and evaluate the quantity and quality of customer interaction, to ensure that we accurately assess the customers’ needs and recommend the most appropriate product or service.
For example, when we embarked on our three-year plan to open new banking centers in high-growth markets, we strengthened our metrics around site selection, deposit tracking and profitability reporting.
We also expanded our financial reporting this year so that shareholders and others can now see the contributions to Comerica’s net income from our primary geographic markets in addition to our three major business segments.
DIVERSITY
We take diversity seriously here at Comerica. Our goals are to:
• establish Comerica as a leader in diversity and work life practices
• position Comerica as the partner of choice for our multicultural constituencies
• hire, retain and develop a diverse work force
For the first time, Comerica ranked in DiversityInc’s “Top 50 Companies for Diversity.” We were
34th in the survey, the only national ranking of its kind, and considered the most in-depth empirical analysis of corporate diversity management and planning. Companies were evaluated based on their commitment to diversity in a number of areas including corporate leadership commitment, corporate communications and supplier diversity, among others.
The solid financial performance we reported for 2005 is the result of our successful execution of our strategy. We’ve charted a course for Comerica, and we’re investing in the people, products, technology and new banking centers that will enable us to grow well into the future.
