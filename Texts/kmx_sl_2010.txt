Letter to Shareholders
    Since we opened our first store in 1993,
our mission has been to provide our cus- tomers with great quality cars at great prices with exceptional customer service. Our unique, no-haggle approach to auto retailing has proven successful over the years in a variety of economic conditions.
However, the last two years provided the opportunity to test the resilience of our model in an unusually challenging environment, including the worst downturn in automo- tive sales in decades. In fiscal 2010, we are proud to report our total revenues increased 7%, and we achieved a record level of earnings, as they increased to $281.7 million from $59.2 million last year.
We are especially proud of the accomplishments of our associates and their contributions to our phenomenal results. We made significant progress on our goal of Building a Better CarMax by developing associates, driving execution and discovering efficiencies. These accomplish- ments included strengthening our sales execution; improv- ing gross profit per unit, while still offering great values
to customers; making substantial progress on increasing operational effectiveness and reducing waste; and growing our market share by more than 10%. We believe strong companies should be able to build market share in good times and bad, and our ability to grow share year after year is a reflection of both the strength of our consumer offer and the preference for our brand.
Our efforts to increase reconditioning process consistency and eliminate waste have allowed us to achieve a sustain- able reduction in reconditioning cost of approximately

$200 per vehicle, while still improving our overall vehicle quality, as measured by our “comeback ratio” and cus- tomer surveys. These savings are available to continue
to optimize sales and profitability. We also successfully managed through one of the most challenging credit envi- ronments in recent history and have positioned CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) to be a continuing strong contributor to our business.
Prior to the start of the year, given the unprecedented weakness in the automotive market and the meltdown of the securitization market, which is CAF’s primary funding source, we felt it was prudent to react quickly to preserve capital and liquidity and maintain the flexibility needed
to remain profitable. As a result, we made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend store growth, and we
took a particularly cautious approach to SG&A spending. Suspending growth resulted in a major reduction in our

capital spending in fiscal 2010, as well as our management bench strength and growth-related costs. We also made significant curtailments in advertising, we implemented a wage freeze for all salaried and hourly associates and a hir- ing freeze at our home office, and we deferred substantially all developmental and discretionary project spending.
We’ve indicated in the past that our decision to renew store growth would be based on seeing sustained improvements in both sales and credit. The credit markets have improved dramatically in the last year. Although sales continue to
be below pre-recession levels and unemployment remains uncomfortably high, we have seen steady improvements in sales. These positive trends, together with our strong prof- itability, have convinced us that it is an appropriate time to resume store growth.
We plan to take a measured approach, opening three pre- viously constructed but unopened stores in fiscal 2011, between three and five stores in fiscal 2012, and between five and ten stores in fiscal 2013. Our fiscal 2011 openings include stores in Augusta, Cincinnati and Dayton, all of which are new markets for CarMax. We believe this pace of growth will allow us to maintain the momentum we’ve achieved on our recent successful initiatives to increase efficiency and reduce waste, while improving the quality of our customer offer. It is more important than ever to sus- tain these gains and remain focused and committed to our
goal of Building a Better CarMax. This pace also allows us to rebuild our store management bench strength and restart our real estate acquisition activity.
We remain confident in the long-term opportunities we provide for associates, customers and shareholders. We continue to be fortunate to have no similar-format, multi- market competitors, and we believe this concept develop- ment advantage, together with our culture of continuous innovation and process improvement, provide us a defen- sible competitive advantage. At the same time, while we are by far the largest used car retailer in the U.S., our share of the overall late-model used vehicle market is less than 3% and we are only in markets that represent about 45% of the U.S. population, reflecting our huge, untapped growth opportunity. We are excited to again be in a position to tackle this opportunity.
In closing, let me once again thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication, our customers for their loyalty, and our shareholders for their confidence in our business. I feel a tremendous sense of pride in being part of such a great team. Our associates are providing exceptional customer service and proving that not only is CarMax a “best place to work” but also the way car buying should be.
