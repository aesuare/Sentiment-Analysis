iscal 2008 was a record year in the
138-year history. We achieved many new milestones, including surpassing $3 billion in sales, generating more than half of our revenues outside the u.s., and breaking the 35 million case
barrier in annual depletion volumes for our entire portfolio. in an environment marked by increasing consumer and competitive challenges, we produced strong results underscored by healthy underlying growth, a strong balance sheet, and excellent cash flows.
FinancialPerformance. FortheyearendedApril30,2008,dilutedearningspersharefrom continuing operations increased to $3.55, an increase of 10% over last year’s earnings. Operat- ing income grew 14% to $685 million on a reported basis, or 8% on an underlying basis. Our net sales for the year increased 17% to a record $3.3 billion, while gross profit grew 14% to $1.7 billion, both benefiting from the addition of the Casa herradura brands acquired in fiscal 2007 and a weaker u.s. dollar. Our healthy cash flows enabled us to pay dividends totaling $158 million to shareholders last year, a 10% increase over dividends paid out in the prior year and the 62nd consecutive year of paying regular quarterly cash dividends.
since the beginning of fiscal 1999, we have returned approximately $1.3 billion to shareholders via dividends and cash distributions, including a $204 million cash distribution in early fiscal 2008 associated with the proceeds received from the sale of Lenox, inc. Our total shareholder return, assuming reinvestment of dividends, over that 10-year period has significantly outpaced the return delivered by the s&P 500. in fact, a $100 investment in our Class B stock at the end of April 1998 would be worth nearly $300 at the end of fiscal 2008. This compares quite favorably to a similar investment in the s&P 500, which today would be worth about $150.
Our total shareholder return for this fiscal year was a healthy 8%, higher than nearly all of our direct competitors and well ahead of the total return for the s&P 500 which declined 5%.
Reflecting our commitment to creating value for shareholders and our confidence in the future, we completed the repurchase of $223 million of our common stock at an average price of $68 per share. We believe this was an excellent investment at a time when both interest rates and our stock price were attractive.
Brand Performance. Because of the continuing excellent performance of our flagship Jack daniel’s brand over the years, some observers of Brown-Forman mistakenly view us as a “one-brand company.” But with 10 brands boasting depletions of more than 1 million cases, we are much more than a one-brand company.
Jack Daniel’s. Last year, Jack daniel’s fortified its position as the world’s best-selling American whiskey brand with global depletions approaching 9.5 million cases. depletions and net sales in the u.s. grew in the low single digits, while outside the u.s., depletions were up 8%, and net sales grew nearly 17%. total nine-liter depletions for the Jack daniel’s family

      of brands, including Gentleman Jack, Jack daniel’s single Barrel, and Jack daniel’s ready-to- drink products, reached more than 10 million cases on a drinks-equivalent basis, representing volume growth of more than 6% for the fiscal year.
Finlandia. ninety percent of Finlandia’s 2.8 million cases were generated outside the u.s., including over 800,000 cases in Poland, the brand’s largest market. The brand continued to be a major growth driver with depletions advancing 16% and net sales gaining 33% this past fiscal year.
SouthernComfort. Oursecond-largestprofitcontributor,southernComfortcontinuedto deliver solid gross profit growth in fiscal 2008, driven by volume and price increases in Australia, south Africa, and some established European markets. Global volumes held steady at nearly 2.5 million cases, despite a decline in the u.s., the brand’s largest market. The brand continues to exemplify our company’s brand renovation capabilities and now has posted nine consecutive years of gross profit growth.
Casa Herradura. in the first full year since we acquired Casa herradura, we carefully evalu- ated the brands’ positioning, pricing, and packaging; implemented new trade practices to reduce excess wholesale and retail inventory in Mexico; and successfully integrated the herradura and el Jimador brands into our u.s. distribution network. We believe these brands, along with the new Mix el Jimador tequila-based ready-to-drink product, will be key con- tributors to the company’s long-term growth. Renowned for crafting tequilas of superior quality and authenticity, Casa herradura was recognized as the 2007 distiller of the year by Wine Enthusiast magazine – the first tequila producer to earn this prestigious title.
BalancedThinking. Asthethemeforthisreporthighlights,webelievethere’snosubstitute for balanced thinking. We believe it is critical to our long-term success and ongoing indepen- dence. A direct reflection of our commitment to balanced thinking is the collaborative, consensus-oriented manner in which our company is run. We have long believed that the collective wisdom of all of us is far superior to the individual intellect of any one of us. The practice of this belief helps us immensely in producing consistently thoughtful and accurate judgments about our business.
We achieve balanced thinking with a skilled and experienced Board and leadership team along with active involvement by Brown family members in management, on our Board, and as supportive shareholders. in the last year, we formed the Brown-Forman/Brown Family shareholders Committee to further encourage open, constructive, ongoing dialogue between the company and its family shareholders. designed for broad family participation and includ- ing several non-family Brown-Forman executives, the committee has formed working groups to study areas of particular interest to family shareholders, including governance, philanthropy,
