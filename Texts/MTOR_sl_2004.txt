To Our Shareowners, Customers and Employees
2004 was a year filled with challenge. With a fluctuating economy, rising fuel prices and global uncertainty, it continues to be a demanding time for the automotive industry and for ArvinMeritor. The limited availability of raw materials ­ particularly steel ­ has forced us to re-examine our business model and look for alternative sources that will allow us to better deliver on our commitments and minimize the impact on our profitability. Escalating healthcare costs are a national issue that received significant attention this year, and led us to develop ways to decrease this business expense through employee education and awareness programs. Continued pricing pressures tested our ability to successfully apply the ArvinMeritor Performance System throughout our global operations and demonstrate bottom-line results. In spite of the challenges we faced, we accomplished a great deal, including winning important new contracts, building new business relationships and introducing breakthrough technology. We are also proud to say we reduced costs and improved quality, achievements that were recognized with an impressive list of customer and industry awards. One of those awards was the coveted Shingo Prize bestowed on our exhaust systems facility in Columbus, Ind., for reaching world-class lean manufacturing status. Another was the Nissan Quality Master Award, which honored ArvinMeritor's Queretaro, Mexico, facility for commitment to quality and continuous improvement. Our Financial Performance At the end of fiscal year 2004, we reported ArvinMeritor sales from continuing operations of $8.0 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 19 percent, from last year. In October 2004, we announced our plans to divest our Light Vehicle Aftermarket (LVA) and coil coating businesses. Therefore, both were reported as discontinued operations. The increase in sales was primarily attributable to stronger global commercial vehicle markets. Operating income increased six percent to $260 million, from $246 million in the same period last year. Income from continuing operations increased to $127 million, a 27-percent increase compared to a year ago, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.85, up from $1.48 per diluted share in the same period last year. A Smooth Transition In August 2004, I joined ArvinMeritor following the retirement of former Chairman and CEO Larry Yost. I did so, because I believe that ours is an organization that has the potential to overcome our industry's challenges, while capitalizing on its tremendous opportunities. In my initial months, I traveled around the world and listened to our employees share their expertise and insight about our products and our customers. They also expressed their conviction about the extraordinary potential of this organization. We all agree that ArvinMeritor excels in qualities that give us a clear advantage over our peers. We have talented employees, who generate a creative energy second to none and are completely dedicated to finding effective solutions to complex issues. We have strong relationships with our customers ­ some of whom have been with us for many years and others who have recently begun to realize the strategic benefits of partnering with an industry leader such as ArvinMeritor. We continue to have a significant presence in the communities where we live and work. With a 100-year tradition of giving back, we believe that we can enhance the quality of life in our communities, particularly by investing in educational initiatives ­ the primary focus of our $2.1 million charitable trust.

A Fresh Perspective My first 100 days with the leadership team, employees, customers, suppliers and analysts provided a unique opportunity for all of us to take a hard look at the business in a new light. During that time, we evaluated our extensive product portfolio to determine exactly what we do best, considering today's market realities. We looked closely at products that either currently hold a market leadership position ­ with solid financial returns ­ or have a clear path to get there. As a result of this in-depth analysis, we have redefined our growth strategy to focus on specific areas of expertise. As we move closer to making this strategy a reality in 2005 and beyond, we are committed to creating a model based on solid, sustainable returns by:  Rationalizing our assets  Refocusing our resources and  Regenerating the business We Will Rationalize. In our pursuit to increase margins and improve return on invested capital (ROIC), we must strengthen our manufacturing base by combining operations where it makes sense, and closing facilities whose profitability consistently does not meet targeted financial objectives.

I joined ArvinMeritor . . . because I believe that ours is an organization that has the potential to overcome our industry's challenges, while capitalizing on its tremendous opportunities.

As part of these restructuring efforts, we closed our exhaust plant in Franklin, Ind., in September 2004. While this decision was a difficult one, more than 25 percent of the Franklin employees were able to secure positions at other ArvinMeritor facilities. We also recently announced our decision to close a light vehicle stabilizer bar facility in Sheffield, England. This operation is part of our MSSC joint venture, a partnership between ArvinMeritor and the Mitsubishi Steel Manufacturing Company, which has facilities in the United States and Canada. We will continue to evaluate our operations on a global scale, and take appropriate action to reduce costs, maximize return on assets and improve our customer responsiveness. We Will Refocus. Divesting non-core operations not only generates cash, but also enables us to concentrate on our strengths. This year, we divested parts of the business that did not fit well with our long-term business strategy. These actions were necessary to improve our long-term viability in an industry that demands strategic focus, solutions and speed. In evaluating our operations to determine if they fit into ArvinMeritor's overall strategy, we will review each in light of the following criteria:  Ability to achieve and sustain a competitive advantage  Potential for market leadership  Size of the market  Ability to provide superior returns  Opportunity for profitable growth  Ability to enhance customer value We are pleased to report that, on Nov. 24, we announced the sale of Roll Coater, Inc. to Willis Stein & Partners. In December, we sold the Light Vehicle Systems (LVS) Columbus, Ind., stampings and components manufacturing operation. We also divested our trailer beam axle operation in Kenton, Ohio, with the intent to concentrate on the design and assembly of complete trailer systems. In addition, we sold our 75-percent share in the AP Amortiguadores, S.A. (APA) shock absorber joint venture to JV partner Kayaba. That move will allow us to focus our ride control expertise and resources on designing and producing the next-generation of suspension systems technologies. Finally ­ as I said earlier ­ in October 2004, we announced our intent to divest our LVA business group. While we are proud of LVA's strong reputation for customer focus and providing some of the world's best-known aftermarket brands, it will be better served under ownership that can invest in and focus on its unique business model.

We Will Regenerate. Gaining market share is paramount to our growth strategy. To achieve that, we will concentrate on creating unmatched ride and handling, environment, and safety solutions in existing and emerging markets. These solutions will create a competitive advantage for those who build the vehicles and deliver an optimal experience for the people who drive them. We've already begun this process. Here are just two examples:  By using existing commercial vehicle expertise in axles, brakes and suspensions, we will focus our resources on becoming a global leader in these same product lines for our passenger car and light-duty truck original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Two significant multi-year contracts for suspension modules were awarded to ArvinMeritor this year. One contract is valued at $150 million for suspension modules for a light vehicle pickup truck; the other is worth $200 million, and is for the final assembly of front and rear cross-car modules. Both begin production in 2005.  In June, we introduced revolutionary new emissions technology ­ namely the plasma fuel reformer ­ which was co-developed with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The technology has enormous potential to enable future diesel and gasoline exhaust emissions solutions, and will be available in time to help our customers meet emissions regulations that go into effect in 2010. The final development of the plasma fuel reformer, supported by a $1.7 million grant from the Indiana 21st Century Research and Development Fund, moves us closer to producing hydrogen-rich gas from diesel fuel. This gas ­ which burns clean at low temperatures ­ can be used to regenerate nitrogen oxide (NOx) traps that will soon be used in diesel exhaust aftertreatments. We continue to take advantage of the opportunities provided by the trend toward OEM de-integration ­ where vehicle manufacturers contract with Tier One suppliers to build complete vehicle modules and systems. Working closely with our OEM customers, our design and manufacturing engineers lead the pack in developing cost-effective, high-performance systems. As OEMs become leaner by outsourcing vehicle segments and modules that are transparent to the consumer, suppliers take on additional responsibility and risk. The initial burden can be heavy, but when a supplier is as flexible and resourceful as ArvinMeritor, that additional weight helps build competitive muscle for the long haul. Forming strategic alliances with other industry leaders creates a significant business advantage, leveraging the strength of each partner to provide technologically advanced solutions for our customers. Through selective agreements with longstanding partners as well as with new ones, we will expand our profitable product lines and deliver even greater shareowner return. And ­ while our strategy for growth is primarily organic ­ we will continue to make acquisitions, when smart opportunities present themselves.

Gaining market share is paramount to our growth strategy. To achieve that, we will concentrate on creating unmatched ride and handling, environment, and safety solutions in existing and emerging markets.

 We signed a letter of intent to enter into a long-term agreement with Axle Alliance Co. (AAC), a subsidiary of DaimlerChrysler (DCX) to be the turnkey supplier for heavy-duty tandem rear drive axles to AAC, ultimately for Freightliner's N.A. Class 8 truck assembly operations. Freightliner, the leading heavy-duty truck manufacturer in North America, is a company of DCX, and this incremental arrangement gives ArvinMeritor the opportunity to further demonstrate our global competitiveness.  In Asia, we formed a major alliance with Shanghai SIIC Transportation Electric Company, Ltd. (STEC) to manufacture passenger vehicle sunroofs for the Shanghai Volkswagen facility. This 50-50 joint venture introduces our popular sunroofs to a passenger car market expected to surpass seven million units a year by 2008.  ArvinMeritor also forged significant joint ventures this year. Two joint ventures, located in Lyon, France, expand ArvinMeritor's capacity to produce commercial vehicle drive axles. With this action, we become one of Volvo's largest global suppliers, producing more than 300,000 axles for commercial truck applications in North America, Europe, Australia, Brazil and India.  We signed a long-term licensing agreement with Raydan Manufacturing to market, engineer and manufacture unique Air LinkTM rear suspension products.

Being global is essential today, and we see exciting opportunities in being part of a world manufacturing economy. We also see being globally diversified as a way to minimize the impact of cyclicality in our CVS business. To meet the needs of new LVS customers as well as those of existing ones, we expanded our presence in Central and Eastern Europe this year by opening a new facility in Swarzedz, Poland ­ our sixth in the area. The Swarzedz operation will provide 200,000 door modules a year for the Volkswagen Caddy, which will be produced at the VW site in nearby Poznan. LVS began making components and systems in the region with the opening of a doors systems facility in Liberec, Czech Republic, in 1992. Two further Czech sites have been added since then ­ one in Mlada Boleslav produces exhaust systems; another in Vrchlabi manufactures door modules. In addition, LVS produces exhaust systems in Jaszarokszallas, Hungary, and Golcuk, Turkey. Continued expansion into emerging markets, and relationships with customers such as Hyundai, Nissan and Toyota, will propel us to even greater growth possibilities. We Are Recharged. The future will not wait, and our competition is not standing still. We must act now, with resolute determination and the confidence that we have what it takes to succeed. Through a clearly defined approach that focuses on our strengths, ArvinMeritor will continue to:  Forge global partnerships  Strengthen new and existing customer relationships  Invest wisely in research and development  Define the product mix  Divest non-core business  Capitalize on markets with high growth potential  Achieve scale and leverage technology across the commercial and light vehicle markets By doing so, our shareowners can expect:  Better return on invested capital  Improved cash flow  Reduced debt We are well-positioned for change, both within the automotive industry and inside our company. It is time to rationalize, refocus and regenerate a passion for results. We will pursue this approach, while keeping our business priorities closely aligned with today's market realities. We have people that search for ­ and find ­ solutions to complex issues. We have a culture that creates opportunities for improvement. We have technology to make time spent on the road safer, smoother and smarter. We will aim high and execute well. The future is now. Sincerely,

Charles G. McClure Chairman, CEO and President December 17, 2004
