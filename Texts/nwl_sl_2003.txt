  Dear Fellow Shareholders,
Three years ago we began a journey to transform
Newell Rubbermaid from a "growth by acquisition" company into a global marketer of consumer and commercial products that could grow organically, fueled by innovation behind a stable of power brands.
To execute a change of this magnitude, we found it neces- sary to not only change our strategy, but to change our culture. In May of 2001, we introduced our "How We Win" Roadmap for Success - a comprehensive plan that establishes The Right Measures, The Right Strategy, The Right Organization, The Right Operating Cycle and The Right Culture.
Now, let me walk you through "How We Win."
The Right Measures
In 2003, we experienced pressure related to increased material cost, elevated competition in low-end product lines and lower production levels that resulted in short-term gross margin contraction. These short-term pressures, combined
This decision puts short-term
pressure on top-line growth and on
gross margin, as the exit of our fixed
costs will not occur at an equally
rapid rate. Over the long-term, how-
ever, this decision will contribute to
gross margin expansion, helping us
improve Operating Income* as a
percent of sales. This is our second
key measure, which we will grow
from 9.5%, delivered in 2003, to our long-term target of 15%.
We have also made consistent progress driving our third measure, Working Capital* as a percent of sales, toward our long-term goal of 20%. At the close of 2003, significant inventory reduction drove working capital as a percent of sales down to 24%, from 30% in 2001. We ended the year with the lowest inventory level in three years. This was truly a great performance delivered by the team.

 with the complexity of our transformation, have extended the time-frame for achieving our financial targets. Nevertheless, we continue to focus on our Five Key Measures because they drive the rightbehaviorsforthelong-termsuccessofthisorganization.
Our first metric, Internal Sales Growth*, was flat for the year compared to 2002. We saw significant growth in many of our high-margin businesses, including Sharpie® permanent markers and IRWIN® hand tools and power tool accessories. However, in some of our businesses, primarily low-end product lines where we cannot support premium pricing with strong brands and product innovation, we saw significant pricing and volume declines. The resulting double- digit sales declines in these categories caused us to take some aggressive strategic actions.
By mid-year, we identified approximately $300 million in annual sales of low-margin product lines that would not yield our target returns in their market categories. We are pleased to report that, by the end of 2003, we took aggressive steps to exit approxi- mately $50 million in sales of these product lines and in 2004 we
will continue this process of rationalizing low-margin product lines.
*defined on page 3
This inventory reduction helped us finish the year with $242 million in Free Cash Flow*, our fourth measure. The company has shown a dramatic improvement in this metric overthepastthreeyears. Wehavegeneratedoveronebillion dollars in Free Cash Flow for the period 2001 to 2003, com- pared to the previous three-year period where we generated $158 million. More importantly, this strong cash flow supports our dividend and our ability to pay down debt. Our long-term goal is to grow Free Cash Flow in line with, or better than, earnings growth.
Our fifth measure is Return on Invested Capital* (ROIC). ROIC is improved by either increasing profitability
or decreasing assets - we are working on both. Regarding profitability, Operating Income is a strong focus for the organi- zation and we are working diligently to improve this metric. Regarding our asset base, we have made significant progress
to right size our manufacturing network. To date, we have closed 78 facilities in North America and Western Europe. Making these decisions is difficult, but necessary to deliver long-term shareholder value. We must manufacture our
1
 
products in a best-cost environment in order to stay competi- tive in the global market place. In addition to rationalizing our facilities, we have become much more disciplined with our capital spending, allocating resources to those projects with the highest returns. This approach will drive improve- ments in ROIC from our current 9.5% level to our long-term target of 15%.
The Right Strategy
Our strategy remains unchanged. Our Six Strategic Initiatives are the right strategies to drive improvement in our five key measures to transform this company into a strong financial performer over the long-term and to unlock the power of our brands.
Our first two initiatives, Productivity and Streamlining, focus on reducing costs. In terms of Productivity, or reducing cost of goods sold (COGS), we continue to build upon our broad-based improvements in purchasing, manufacturing efficiencies as well as distribution and transportation.
NWL OPEX is a methodical process focused on lean manufac- turing. It includes creating the right manufacturing and distri- bution metrics and using these to drive improvements quarter after quarter. In 2003, we trained all of our plant managers in the principles of NWL OPEX and are encouraged with the prospects for 2004 and beyond.
In terms of Streamlining, or reducing non-strategic selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A), the team has cut $125 million dollars of redundant or unnecessary SG&A at an annualized rate. We have reinvested these dollars to support strategic growth through new product development, marketing and brand building. We are encouraged with these cost savings and recognize cost reduction is an on-going process critical to funding future growth.
Our next four strategic initiatives are where our leadership translates into an unassailable competitive advantage.
We have focused on installing and fostering our
New Product Development process, as high-margin, new products are key to our success. This process and discipline
 Additionally, we continue to execute on our three-year restruc- turing program, which began in 2001 and was designed to drive best-cost performance in our manufacturing network.
As planned, we will complete the charges related to this program in the second quarter of 2004 and expect annualized savings of approximately $150 million.
As part of our productivity initiative, we have an internal target to deliver 5% cost reductions year over year. We fell short of our goal in 2003, primarily due to rising material costs that we were unable to offset

through other initiatives. This is unacceptable to our organiza- tion. In order to deliver our productivity targets going for- ward, we are focused on the deployment of Newell Operational

have been infused throughout the company and the team has delivered many innovative, high-margin products.
The writing instruments team launched the Paper Mate® Tandem™. This dual-use pen, with detachable, refillable high- lighter and comfort grip, is ideal for business, travel or study. Calphalon launched its highly-anticipated Calphalon® One™ Infused Anodized product line. This patent-pending, revolution- ary, infused anodized cooking surface outperforms existing high-
end cookware by combining the benefits of a traditional hard- anodized surface with the benefits of a non-stick surface.
At IRWIN, Strait-Line® laser tools generated superior results and provide an excellent platform for growth in
the measuring and marking tool categories. Our Rubbermaid business is delivering smarter solutions for
pets through innovation, style and quality. The Rubbermaid® Pets product line includes doghouses, pet grooming,
travel and food storage products.
These products are just a few examples from our new
product pipeline. This initial progress is encouraging, but we are still in the nascent phase of developing our new product

developmentprocess. Ourchallengeoverthepastfewyears has not been a lack of ideas, but rather finding the right cadence of new product introductions that our manufacturing network and sales and marketing teams could execute. Today our teams are in a much better rhythm, focused on impact ver- sus activity. Our pipeline is building and gaining traction.
We have worked hard on strengthening the company's Marketing capabilities. By creating demand for our products through grass roots marketing to the end user, we are moving from a push to a pull strategy. We are also focused on strengthening the brands within our portfolio. With that in mind, in mid-2003, we unified our professional grade hand tools and power tool accessories business under the IRWIN® brand name. As part of the global strategy, each of IRWIN's sub-brands, like VISE-GRIP® and Marathon®, will retain its category-leading name while endorsing a common IRWIN® brand identity. This creates a strong platform in global hand tools and power tool accessories and provides future expansion opportunities into new categories under the IRWIN® brand.
Havingwalkedthrougheachofoursix initiatives, I would reiterate that our strategy has not changed. However, we have learned that some of the businesses in our portfolio do not fit our strategic model. Therefore, a key priority for the company in 2004 is to build The Right Portfolio -- divest businesses whose fundamentals do not align with our strategic direction. We have identified 10%- 15% of our portfolio that has limited brand strength and innovation potential, two areas we believe critical to establish a competitive advantage. We are optimistic we will complete the bulk of these divestitures in 2004, leaving a strong core portfolio of businesses.

 We continue to focus on retailers with the brightest futures through our Strategic Account Management process. In 2003, we generated a 12% increase in sales to our eight most-strate- gic accounts. The most promising aspect of this program is,
as our company develops innovations and creates end-user demand through impactful marketing, we have a strong distribution network of high-growth retail partners. This is
a very powerful formula that will yield great returns for our organization in the years ahead.
Through our Collaboration initiative we continue to act as one company, leveraging our divisional talent, expertise and relationships. The Rubbermaid Tough Tools™ line, launched in 2003, is a collection of hand tools designed for the beginner to intermediate do-it-yourself (DIY) market. This product line was a direct result of collaborative efforts between Rubbermaid and our tool business. They brought together a powerful brand and a quality product, expanding into new categories and new channels of distribution. We have an extremely talented and creative organization. When we share ideas and best practices, the results are exponentially better.
Roberts to Co-Chief Operating Officers. This new structure aligns all of our businesses under the guidance of two of our strongest and proven leaders. Additionally, this structure leverages their operational talent across multiple divisions and provides continuity and focus on the execution of NWL OPEX.
Our Phoenix Program is also helping us create the right organization. We've hired over 1,500 college graduates into this program since its inception in July 2001. The Phoenicians focus on building relationships at the store level in our strate- gic accounts and developing in-store merchandising, training and product sell-through initiatives. The goal of the Phoenix Program has always been to give ambitious, talented individu- als experience with our products, our strategic accounts and our consumers in order to develop a world-class farm system of talent. We have promoted over 460 Phoenicians, further strengthening the knowledge and direct customer experience level within the organization.

The Right Operating Cycle
Over the past few years our operating cycle has strengthened our organization. At the divisional and corporate level, we have instituted consistent monthly, quarterly and annualreviews. Thesedynamicexchangesservetomonitorcur- rent progress against our core metrics while helping to establish priorities, foster open communication, assess opportunities, and develop cross-functionalities. We now have an operating rhythm for our 28 divisions that keeps us focused on what's important.
The Right Culture
Culture is one of the most difficult things to change in an organization. A Newell Rubbermaid culture, reflecting the val- ues and dedication of our 40,000 employees, has taken shape within our organization. Principles of our culture like cus- tomer focus, teamwork and consistently “raising the bar” have become second nature. Our team is energized, motivated and more passionate than ever.
Closing Remarks
As I look back over the past three years, we have made great strides in positioning Newell Rubbermaid for long-term
success. We have implemented a consistent strategy through- out the entire organization and developed the right set of metrics to measure and monitor our performance. We have built an extremely talented organization with the skill set necessary to execute our strategy. We have achieved a good operating rhythm for our organization. Perhaps most impor- tantly, we have unified the company around a new culture.
Make no mistake, it has not been an easy journey. There have been bumps in the road along the way, including a diffi- cult 2003. We have celebrated some exciting victories and learned some valuable lessons during this process. We enthusiastically look forward to our prospects in 2004 when we will complete our restructuring program, improve our business portfolio and continue to execute our “How We Win” Roadmap to unleash our company's full potential.
Sincerely,
Joseph Galli

The Phoenix Program is creating a highly talented organization at Newell Rubbermaid. Members of the Phoenix Program are recent college graduates who begin their careers at the store level focused on strategic accounts. More importantly this program is a “farm system” for Newell Rubbermaid to develop talented leaders and deploy those individuals in other areas of organization.
The individuals shown to the left, end-user specialists at IRWIN Industrial Tool Company, are participating in a hands-on product training session at the
Rubbermaid IRWIN Training Center in Huntersville, NC. They all began their
careers as members of the Phoenix Program and have since earned their second and,
for some, third promotion within the organization. Newell Rubbermaid’s “promote from within” philosophy moves these ambitious talented individuals, who have experience with products, strategic accounts and consumers, into other roles helping to develop the right organization and to infuse the right culture at Newell Rubbermaid.
