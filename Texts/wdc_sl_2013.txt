 Dear Fellow Shareholders:
During fiscal year 2013, we demonstrated the strength
of our business model with excellent operating results underpinned by strong execution by our HGST and WD subsidiaries. We also continued to expand our footprint in the storage industry through investments addressing high growth opportunities in the public and private clouds, thin and light ultraportable devices and the Connected Life in homes and small and medium-sized businesses.
Revenue for fiscal year 2013 was $15.4 billion, up 23% from $12.5 billion in fiscal 2012, reflecting the contribution of a full year of HGST operations. We generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations during the fiscal year and our free cash flow totaled
$2.2 billion (which consisted of cash flow from operations less capital expenditures). As part of our capital allocation strategy, we repurchased 19.0 million shares in fiscal 2013 for $842 million. We also declared dividends totaling $1.00 per share, or $240 million, during fiscal year 2013.

Research and development continued to increase as we invested in new products and innovative technology to meet customer needs.

       Our broad-based participation in the creation, management, experience and preservation of digital data is resulting in a more diversified revenue mix. Over the
last five years our non-PC related businesses have grown from 34% to 50% of our revenue, driven by our enterprise and branded products businesses, both of which address cloud computing. PCs remain an important market for our products, but we are less reliant on them than at any time since the inception of the PC.
We are well positioned to capitalize on an important long- term secular growth trend — the ongoing expansion in digital data — as consumers and commercial enterprises increasingly interact with digital content on a daily basis.
We are seeing dramatic changes in the storage
industry — changes in the needs, use cases and buying patterns of existing and new customers as
they grapple with the challenges of managing this growth. This has resulted in more strategic relationships with customers, as we collaborate, innovate and
create additional value with our significant technology resources and highly experienced storage teams.
We have established a leadership position in the fastest growing areas of the industry and in the last year we have introduced several new products aimed at building on this leadership, including our:
• 7-platter, helium sealed drives that address the energy and space cost challenges of our cloud infrastructure customers,
• low-profile 5 and 7 millimeter solid state hybrid drives and hard drives designed for new ultraportable devices,
• hard drive and NAS solutions for small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), and
• expanding offering of enterprise-class solid state drives for the most demanding applications in tiered enterprise storage architectures.

       In addition to investing in our core business, we are making highly selective strategic investments to augment and strengthen our capabilities to address the future needs of new and existing customers. These actions include the pending acquisition of Virident and the acquisitions of sTec and VeloBit, which collectively will enhance the value of our offerings in enterprise solid state storage, a fast growing, rapidly changing and highly strategic space, and the acquisition of Arkeia Software, which provides network backup software and appliances to our SMB business.
We are excited about the long-term outlook for storage and our increasingly strategic position within the
vast digital data ecosystem, and we will continue to explore ways to enhance our value. We are a market and customer driven company, focused on growth
and innovation. I am confident that this approach will differentiate us as one of the world’s leading technology companies in the years ahead.
