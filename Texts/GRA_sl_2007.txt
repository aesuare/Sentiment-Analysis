Dear Shareowners, Colleagues and Customers,
I am very pleased to report our results for 2007. We continue to make progress toward our vision of making W. R. Grace & Co. one of the world's premier specialty chemical and materials providers. Continued improvements in growth and productivity were realized in 2007, as were the benefits of becoming a more tightly integrated operating company.
In 2007, our sales were $3.1 billion and our pre-tax income from core operations was $284.6 million, representing increases of 10.2% and 18.5%, respectively, from the prior year. We offset increases in the cost of raw materials through our productivity efforts, which significantly helped the bottom line. I want to thank all 6,500 Grace employees for the hard work and dedication that made this possible. I also want to thank our customers for trusting us to provide what they need to succeed. We take the faith you place in us very seriously. That is our core purpose. We continued to extend our geographic reach in 2007, with sales up in Europe, Middle East and Africa by 21%, Asia Pacific by 13% and Latin America by 32%. Today, 67% of our sales come from outside the United States. In 2007, we opened or expanded facilities in Belgium, China, India, Ireland, Poland and Vietnam, and completed an acquisition in Spain. We kicked off 2008 by celebrating the grand opening of an office in Dubai. We constantly assess where the growth opportunities are and allocate our most precious resource, our people, to those areas. There are more statistics I could mention, but they would all be making the same point: Grace today is a more vibrant company. And the reason is simple: we adopted a strategy of driving growth and productivity and empowered our people to implement it. More people than I ever imagined have stepped up and succeeded.

These changes, along with our global reach, will help us face future challenges. The continuing downturn in the U.S. housing market, which suffered a decline in housing starts of approximately 25% in 2007, affected us negatively and we don't know when it will recover. Despite this decline, we were able to grow our construction products business by 7.5%, thanks to outstanding performance in Europe and Asia. During the year, we made changes to our businesses in order to sharpen our focus. First, we turned our Performance Chemicals business into a pure construction business by merging the packaging technologies product group into our Grace Davison operating segment. More than a move on an organizational chart, this merger of product offerings helps us benefit from overlapping synergies. Second, we sold our washcoat business. We decided that, from a resource utilization standpoint, there were better places to invest.

These results are impressive, even more so when considering how far we've come in just seven years.

ment. In 2007, we invested $80 million, an increase of 63%. In 2007, 35% of sales came from products introduced over the last five years, a very nice payback from our investment. in 2000, our savings from productivity have more than tripled, with Green Belts accounting for nearly two-thirds of that total. Our 75 Black Belts and Lean Masters held more than 200 Lean events last year, each helping us be more productive. place to work. In 2000, our recordable incident rate was 1.39, while in 2007 it was 0.83, an improvement of 40.3%. I am every bit as proud of that improvement as I am of the other metrics.

· Last but not least is our progress in making Grace a safer

When all is said and done, however, our greatest contribution to sustainable development is helping our customers address the issue. We created a Biofuel Technologies Group because we saw the need for catalysts that help customers process alternative products into fuel. We launched a green building initiative that allows our construction customers to meet new energy efficiency standards. Outside the U.S., we helped customers understand how to use our products to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) credits. Sustainable development is just one example of how we are turning challenges into opportunities.

Like most global companies, we are focusing significant efforts on sustainable development, which we define fairly simply: using fewer of the planet's natural resources to make our products while being a source of positive energy in our communities. We are using numerous post-consumer materials in our products, looking at additional recycling opportunities and changing our capital approval process to take into consideration the economics of energy conservation projects.

A Global Force to Help Our Customers Grow Their Businesses.

As optimistic as I am about our businesses, I am also aware of the tremendous challenges that lie ahead of us: resolving our legal issues. While we made progress on various parts of our Chapter 11 case, resolving our past and future personal injury liability has proven elusive. We have been operating under the protection of Chapter 11 for almost seven years. I want the people who were made ill because of exposure to a Grace product to receive the compensation they deserve, and I want our company to move forward unencumbered by the constraints of Chapter 11.

ever before. Our manufacturing locations are not isolated, but part of a larger system that we can leverage. There is a connectivity in today's Grace that simply didn't exist before. Last year's annual report was titled "Bonds that Build Business." I've thought about that term as I've visited with customers and wondered why these bonds keep getting stronger. Why do customers trust us so much? The answer is that our people share a common purpose. They are completely dedicated to the success of our customers. And, in return, our customers trust us to provide them with products, knowledge, technologies and services that make their products work better. That's why I am confident that we are prepared to address the future. I fully expect those bonds that have almost doubled the size of Grace in the last seven years to be stronger tomorrow than today. It's exciting to be part of it. Thank you for your support.

There is little progress to report in the government's criminal case against Grace and six former executives regarding Grace's former operations in Libby, Montana. As with the reorganization, I believe it is important to get this behind us. As we prepare for the future, none of us has a crystal ball. Past performance is just that ­ past performance. It is in no way indicative of our future. However, I am optimistic that we are well prepared for what may come our way.

Today, we are a stronger company because we work together better around the world. We invested in upgrading our marketing talent and are better tuned into the marketplace than
