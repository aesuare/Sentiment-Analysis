LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

(CONTINUED) We increased our annual earnings with 15.1 percent earnings per share growth. Our total revenues increased 5.6 percent, our net revenues grew 9.3 percent, and our income from operations was up 9.6 percent. Many of our key sales and productivity metrics realized strong performance in 2014. Our total customer count was 46,000, and we expanded our carrier relationships to 66,000. The net revenue per employee increased to $172,800 in 2014, and we finished the year with 1 1,521 employees around the world.

One of the pillars in our long-term growth strategy is cross-selling. As our sales and account management teams draw from an extensive service portfolio, they create unique solutions that enable customers to manage their transportation spend, minimize risk, increase efficiency, and achieve their desired business outcomes. The number of services per customer continues to grow, year over year. We expect this trend to continue as we increase our market share with new and existing customers. Although we are one of the largest third party logistics providers (3PLs) in the world, tremendous opportunity remains for continued global growth. With the integration of Phoenix behind us, the combined Global Forwarding organization is well positioned with strong leadership, consistent operational processes, and a focus on growth. In the ocean and air service lines, we are expanding our business into more lanes, such as Europe to North America, Asia to Europe, and North America to Asia. We continue to optimize our network to gain scale from density so that we can offer more value to our customers.

We have long stated that our value proposition performs best in vibrant and challenging environments. Our North American surface transportation network generated strong results by delivering excellent customer service, improving productivity metrics, and developing the industry's most talented team of logistics professionals. The year 2014 started with a severe winter season that significantly disrupted supply chains, and the challenging market conditions continued throughout the year. Leveraging our network of offices and portfolio of services paid dividends as we worked closely with customers and suppliers to execute, adapt, and innovate. North American truckload net revenues increased 1 1.8 percent, and less than truckload net revenues increased 8.1 percent in 2014.

HONING OUR PROCESS
With proven solutions and practical experience, we have achieved a position as a market leader. Customers can leverage our capabilities globally, developing and applying consistent processes across their supply chains. As they gain greater efficiencies and savings, we enable global growth.

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT PROACTIVE SOLUTIONS PROVEN PROCESSES

In North America, the truckload, less than truckload, and intermodal services performed well last year under difficult circumstances. We expect the industry will continue to face challenges as regulatory changes, driver shortages, and economic growth impact the transportation industry. In 2014, we leveraged the talent investments of prior years to execute the business. Looking ahead, we plan to add talent to drive and support growth initiatives. The acquisition of Freightquote increases our business with small companies and strengthens our value proposition to pursue this large market segment. We are focused on driving growth with customers of all sizes and industries. We have developed refined processes in several industry verticals where we are well positioned to accelerate growth. The ability to quickly and flexibly transition between modes is increasingly important to our customers, and we will continue to offer the best solution to effectively manage costs and service requirements. We have a strategy to win in an increasingly competitive industry. Our best opportunities can only be realized through continued investment in talent and innovation. Our people have always set us apart. We carefully acquire new talent, develop individuals, and build teams to lead our business forward. Innovation contributes to our success and is a key attribute of our brand. Technology leads in our innovation investments. Navisphere®, our proprietary

global technology platform, is continually enhanced, adapted, and improved to add functionality to benefit our customers. This system allows the network to collaborate and communicate with over 100,000 companies. Navisphere also provides the functionality to execute the increasingly complex transactions in our business. We are excited to add the e-commerce platform of the Freightquote technology, which enables smaller customers to facilitate all aspects of their freight transactions online. Our future is bright, and we know we must be diligent in pursuing our ambitious goals. Our key initiatives targeting growth, increased efficiency, and talent development keep us centered in our day to day endeavors. A special thank you to our employees, who worked incredibly hard to make our success possible in 2014. To our valued shareholders, we thank you for the continued trust in us as we focus on creating shareholder value and serving all of our various stakeholders. Thank you,

John P. Wiehoff Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
