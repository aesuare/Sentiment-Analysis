DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
2014 was a year of significant strategic change in our company. We completed the acquisition of Tri-Ed to build on our leading position in physical security and initiated a process that led to an agreement to sell our OEM Supply ­ Fasteners business.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Our largest segment, Enterprise Cabling & Security Solutions ("ECS"), achieved significant milestones during the year. Following over two years of slower growth resulting from a cautious IT investment environment, spending by our enterprise customers accelerated in the second half of the year. Improvements in market conditions, combined with internal actions we took to improve our legacy security business, resulted in a strong second half of the year and positions us to capitalize on positive trends and improved market conditions in 2015. From a strategic perspective, Tri-Ed complements Anixter's product portfolio -- with minor overlap in terms of customers and suppliers -- enhancing our ability to offer a complete security solution across the full spectrum to our target customer base. Our Electrical and Electronic Wire & Cable ("W&C") segment achieved solid results in the face of a challenging economic environment, as our team grew through our expansion with global engineering firms, continued penetration into Europe and emerging markets, success in natural resource and power generation projects, and strong performance in our Industrial Communication and Control initiative. OEM Supply ­ Fasteners ("Fasteners") continued to deliver improved operating performance, reflecting strong leadership with a focus on operating efficiencies and process improvements in the sales, operations and sourcing functions. This led to a significant improvement in both operating margin and working capital performance. In early 2015, we announced the agreement to sell this segment to American Industrial Partners ("AIP") for $380 million. This announced sale will provide Anixter with additional financial flexibility to grow and invest in our industry-leading global platforms. It will also improve our investment profile, as the resulting core business will have lower European exposure, less currency risk, decreased volatility, higher operating margins and improved working capital.

OUTLOOK
As we look forward to 2015 and beyond, we expect the macroeconomic and regulatory environments to remain challenging. The Tri-Ed acquisition and announced sale of the Fasteners business will enable us to sharpen our focus on our core cabling segments, ECS and W&C, which operate in solid global markets characterized by strengthening underlying growth trends. From a geographic perspective, economic activity around the world remains tepid, with the strongest growth in our business driven by North America. We expect this trend to continue into 2015. While we expect a reduction in our European exposure, primarily as a result of our M&A activities, we remain steadfastly committed to the region as we recognize its importance to our global customers. We are encouraged by our success in emerging markets, fueled by our strong performance in Latin America where our organic growth significantly outperformed the market -- a testament to excellent execution by our Latin American team. Underpinning growth in our ECS segment is the exponential rise in the use of mobile devices and data creation, which is necessitating ever-increasing capacity for data storage, in addition to the ongoing demand for physical security solutions. Continued global investment in infrastructure, as well as investment in natural resource development, utility and chemical plants will continue to drive customer spending in our W&C segment. We operate in very large, fragmented, growing and global industries, characterized by many customers and suppliers. This provides significant opportunities for growth through our differentiated and specialized model.

PEOPLE/CULTURE
We believe it is important to support the global communities where our employees live and where we conduct business. Through the Anixter Cares program, we focus our charitable efforts around the areas of poverty, education and disaster relief. As a company, we support organizations such as the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and various education institutions. We also encourage our employees to take leadership roles in the causes and charities they care about. We offer an employee matching gift program as well as time off for volunteering. Our guiding philosophy, as outlined in the Blue Book, which was written more than 45 years ago, continues to embody our values and influence our culture. Among our core beliefs: We are serious about service. We are a community of "doers" who aren't afraid to work hard. In 2014, this belief was on display as we joined other leading organizations to bring awareness to the growing poverty housing crisis in the greater Chicago region. The "Raise Your Hand Chicagoland" house build event, sponsored by Chicagoland Habitat for Humanity, took place alongside Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago. Anixter was a major corporate sponsor, and 40 Anixter employees volunteered at the event. In all, wall frames for 13 houses were constructed during the four-day build. The event also raised over $1.2 million to support Habitat for Humanity's work in the region. As a member of the United Nations Global Compact, we are committed to responsible practices that help create opportunities for communities and economies around the globe. Learn more about our recent and ongoing accomplishments in the "2014 Corporate Responsibility Report: Commitment in Action."

CONCLUSION
As always, our goals are to deliver superior returns to our investors while focusing on the needs of all of our key stakeholders. Over the past 12 months, we compared well to our distribution industry peers although we were disappointed that our total shareholder return underperformed the broader market. We recognize our role as a steward of our investors' capital and focus on thoughtful capital deployment, with our priorities remaining to first invest in organic growth, followed by investing in financially and strategically compelling acquisitions. When we do not have superior investment alternatives, we are committed to returning value to shareholders, as we have done consistently over the past decade. During that time, we returned over 70 percent of our available cash to shareholders. As we frequently say, it always comes down to our people. In that spirit, we would like to recognize and thank Giulio Berardesca, a widely recognized industry expert who will retire in 2015 after dedicating over 40 years to Anixter, most recently as Executive Vice President of our Wire & Cable segment. With a deep bench of experienced leaders and strong succession planning, we look forward to a seamless transition. In conclusion, Anixter is a company on the move. We enter 2015 with a sharper strategic focus on our core businesses, delivering value to our customers through our proven ability to help them reduce the risk, cost and complexity of their supply chains. Sincerely,

Samuel Zell Chairman
