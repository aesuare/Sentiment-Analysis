04 AUTOLIV 2013 / PRESIDENTS LETTER

Dear Shareholder,
2013 was another year that proved the strength in our growth strategy for Autoliv. For many years, it has been our strategy to invest in Active Safety and Growth Markets - primarily China - to achieve superior growth. In 2013, this strategy resulted in a 57% organic sales growth for Autoliv in Active Safety and a 26% organic sales growth for Autoliv in China. These two growth drivers accounted for 70% of our Company's organic sales growth of 7% and were the main reasons that our Company could continue to outperform the automotive safety market which grew by 4%. Our organic sales were twice as strong as the 3.5% increase in global light vehicle production (LVP).

As a result, we continued to gain market share, reaching a 37% global market share in passive safety. This improved market position will be a strong foundation for our sales development in coming years. Also in line with our strategy, we continued to deliver solid margins and cash flows. These results were achieved despite the fact that Western European LVP remained at the lowest levels in more than 15 years, not counting the 2009 financial crisis year. In response to this headwind, we took another $40 million in capacity alignment charges. However, despite this charge which reduced our operating margin by 0.6 percentage points, and currency head winds, we managed to deliver a U.S. GAAP operating margin of 8.6%, well in line with our long-term target range of 8% to 9%. We also delivered an operating cash flow in excess of $800 million, which was nearly a record high. This strong performance of Autoliv is a testimony to the hard work, dedication and skills of our employees. It is their talent and high motivation - at all levels - that drive the success of our Company. I would therefore like to thank each and every one of them for their contribution to these achievements.
RETURNING MORE FUNDS TO SHAREHOLDERS One important change in 2013 was our announcement of a revised debt limitation policy. In the revised policy, the target for the leverage

ratio is set to around one time (for definition, see page 54). Additionally, the leverage ratio should not deviate more than 0.5 times from the target. This revised policy offers greater flexibility, while providing a "safety margin" for our creditors in bad times as the high end of the leverage ratio has been revised from significantly below 3 times in the old policy to 1.5 times. When we revised the debt limitation policy, we also communicated that we had the aim to reach the 0.5-1.5 range by the end of 2014. Since we were already net cash positive at the beginning of 2013 and expected to generate another $700 million during 2013, we decided to significantly step up our returns to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs. As a result, the returns to shareholders almost doubled, from $178 million during 2012 to $339 million during 2013, which was almost 75% of our 2013 "free cash flow", (i.e. net cash before financing) was returned to shareholders. In 2013, the total dividend amount was 8% higher than in 2012 and we resumed Autoliv's share repurchase program. In total we bought back over 1.6 million shares. In addition, in January 2014, the Board of Directors approved an additional 10 million shares for repurchase, which gives management the right to repurchase a total of 11.6 million shares. This new mandate followed the Board's decision in December 2013 to raise the dividend per share from 50 cents to 52 cents for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter this year.

"2014 should become a year that proves the strength in our growth strategy, while providing a testimony to the hard work of our employees".
Jan Carlson, President & CEO

BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE We stepped up the returns to shareholder to $339 million, and spent close to $900 million investing for the future. We spent $379 million, or 4.3% of sales in capital expenditures alone, and $489 million, or 5.6% of sales in Research, Development and Engineering (R,D&E). We continue to invest heavily in China where we had our two largest capital expenditures ever in 2013. The purpose of these two capital investments is both to provide additional manufacturing capacity for our growing business and to reduce costs by allocating manufacturing closer to customers. Both new plants in China (an airbag propellant center and a textile center) are expected to begin production in 2014. In R,D&E, we continue to explore new technical possibilities, both in passive safety and active safety (as seen on page 16). Our strong position in active safety is becoming increasingly important strategically as more and more vehicle manufacturers develop cars that can drive by themselves, so called autonomously driven cars. These vehicles will need forward-looking vision and radar systems as well as surround-view cameras that Autoliv along with other companies have been developing. Therefore, it turns out that our pioneering efforts in active safety will pave the way for semi-automated and autonomous driving vehicles. CONTINUED FOCUS ON OPERATIONS Also going forward, we will continue to focus on operations. Western European LVP is not expected to recover significantly any time soon. Consequently, we need to continue to execute on our European capacity alignment program. The implementation of the program (originally initiated in February 2012) is taking longer than initially planned, but we are on track reaching the expected savings. Additionally, we have some specific operational challenges, arising primarily from our strong sales growth in steering wheels in Europe and our supply structure in Brazil. These items had a negative impact on our operating margin in 2013, but the effect should gradually diminish in 2014 through our continued focus on execution. Operational focus also includes focus on quality. This is becoming increasingly important as vehicle manufactures continuously raise

their quality requirements in order to develop and produce ever superior quality cars for the car-buying public. Therefore, an uncompromising view on quality is fundamental in everything we do, and our target is of course zero defects. In 2013 we moved closer to this zero-defect target as all of our key quality indicators improved.
OUTLOOK 2014 In 2014, global LVP is expected by the market institute IHS to grow by over 3%, as in 2013. However, IHS expects the strong LVP growth of 14% in China, recorded in 2013, to decline to 10% and in the important West European market, LVP is expected to increase by only 1% from its extremely low level in 2013. Despite these mixed market conditions, the indication is for Autoliv to be able to grow its organic and consolidated sales by around 5% in 2014 and achieve an operating margin of around 9%, excluding costs for capacity alignments and antitrust investigations for the full year 2014. Most of the sales improvements in 2014 are again expected to come from China and Active Safety. In addition, we should start to see increasing savings from our employees' hard work with the capacity alignment program in Europe. As a result, 2014 should become a year that proves the strength in our growth strategy, while providing a testimony to the hard work of our employees.

Yours sincerely,

Jan Carlson Stockholm, February 21, 2014
