 To our ShareholderS
2007 was a challenging year. The Company and the homebuilding industry were confronted with market conditions that continued to deteriorate. The demand for new homes weakened significantly from 2006, as mortgage financing became more difficult and homebuyer confidence waned. These and other factors led to fewer new orders, higher cancellations, higher housing inventory, and weaker pricing across most markets. Given these challenging market conditions, we attained the following results in 2007:
• Homebuilding revenues of $5.0 billion
• $334 million of net income
• Diluted earnings per share of $54.14
• Cash flow generated from operating activities was $559 million • Generated 12,270 new orders
• Ended the year with 5,145 backlog units, with a dollar value of $1.9 billion
Although these results are far from where we would like them to be, we adjusted to changing market conditions; and consequently, we are proud to have outpaced the broader homebuilding industry. We were the most profitable homebuilder in 2007 and one of very few who remained profitable this year. We continue to lead the industry in return on equity, return on capital, and inventory turnover. We increased our market share by focusing on creating compelling values for our customers. We also maintained our balance sheet liquidity with our industry leading 15% debt to capital ratio.
There are many macroeconomic factors we cannot control that negatively impacted our business in 2007. While we recognize these factors, we also understand that we don’t make the market, we simply serve it. We need to adapt to changing market conditions and continue to focus on the things that we can control, rather than those that we cannot.
At the top of the list of things we can control is our proven business strategy. Our strategy emphasizes liquidity and market concentration, while minimizing risk. Unlike our major competitors, we are not in the land development business. We acquire finished lots exclusively through option contracts, limiting our exposure to a small percentage of the actual land cost. In the event of a downturn, like the one we are in today, we have greater flexibility than our competitors. The liquidity generated by our business model allows us to take advantage of opportunities, whatever may arise.
A second aspect of our business strategy is market concentration. We strive to increase market share in all of our markets. This allows us to leverage our management talent and business relationships, resulting in lower costs and higher returns. We believe that both aspects of our business strategy are extremely important given the current homebuilding market. They have been cornerstones of our success over the years and will allow us to meet the challenges that lie ahead.

 A third part of our business that we can control is the way we treat our customers. We take great pride in our reputation as a company that places the customer first. We work with our customers to ensure they are satisfied from the moment they first enter our model. We focus on their needs throughout the home buying experience — from working with them through the financing process, to building a quality home, and standing by our product beyond the date we deliver their home. Valuing our customers in this way is the right thing to do. It also helps us to increase our market share and improve financial results.
We would like to thank everyone who has partnered with us during this difficult year. We are proud of the performance of our employees, subcontractors, developers, and suppliers. Their dedicated service and commitment to NVR is very much appreciated and will be instrumental in allowing us to survive and thrive in this difficult economic environment.
We would also like to extend a special thank you to George Slye, one of our board members, for his dedicated service and contributions to NVR. George will be leaving the board in 2008, after serving as an invaluable board member since 1993. His guidance and leadership helped the company achieve tremendous growth through the years. We wish him well in his retirement.
The homebuilding industry experienced a difficult year in 2007. While these challenging market conditions will likely continue, we truly believe that within these challenges lie opportunities. We are excited to use our financial strength, proven business strategies, and dedicated team of employees to find and take advantage of these opportunities.
Sincerely,
Dwight C. Schar Chairman of the Board
Paul C. Saville President and CEO
