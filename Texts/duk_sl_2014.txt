South Carolina.

Approximately 23 million people across six states rely on Duke Energy for electric and natural gas service. We touch many additional lives through our nonregulated commercial businesses in the U.S. and Latin America. Our long-term success as a business depends on how well we serve customers' needs and adapt to their changing expectations. It's also very personal. Our employees live and work in these communities. Consequently, we never take the privilege and responsibility of our mission for granted. We are taking steps to improve our customers' experience when they interact with Duke Energy. For example, we are identifying new and better ways to communicate with our customers about power outages and restoration, as well as making account setup and payment more convenient. We're also digging deeper to understand our customers' different needs and expectations for customized new products and services.
