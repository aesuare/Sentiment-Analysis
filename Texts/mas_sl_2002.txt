 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Your Company successfully met or exceeded many of its operational and financial objectives even though the year 2002 was characterized by geopolitical instability, economic uncertainty, declining consumer confi- dence and the continuing consolidation of our customer base.
Aided by the acquisition of several leading home improvement and building products and service companies and a number of cost containment and profit improvement programs, Masco achieved record sales and oper- ating profit in 2002.
Our leadership position is built upon strong brands, focused product development, strategic marketing initiatives and an entrepreneurial culture supported by disciplined, professional management.
Our efforts are directed toward building mutually beneficial partner- ships with builders, remodeling contractors, wholesalers and retailers to provide value to consumers as they build and remodel their homes, confi- dent in the style and quality of Masco’s broad range of building and home improvement products and services.
Net sales, aided by acquisitions, were a record $9.4 billion, a 14 per- cent increase over the $8.3 billion that we achieved in 2001. Excluding acquisitions, net sales increased eight percent over the prior year.
Net sales from our North American operations, accounting for approximately 85 percent of the Company’s sales, increased 13 percent to $7.9 billion in 2002 from $7.0 billion in 2001. Net sales from International operations, principally in Europe, increased 15 percent to $1.5 billion in 2002 from $1.3 billion in 2001.

  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Masco Corporation 4 2002 Annual Report

 Net income was $590 million and earnings per common share were $1.15. Excluding the effect of unusual items during the year (principally the items detailed below), net income for the year 2002 was $780 million or $1.52 per common share.
In the first half of 2002, the Company recorded a non-cash account- ing change charge of $117 million pre-tax or $92 million after-tax for the impairment write-down of goodwill related principally to certain European operations.
In the last half of 2002, the Company recorded a $147 million pre-tax charge, net for the preliminary settlements to resolve all class action law- suits pending in the United States against the Company and its subsidiary, Behr Process Corporation, related to certain exterior wood coating products formerly manufactured by Behr.
Capital expenditures for the year were $285 million, compared with $274 million in 2001. Depreciation and amortization for 2002 was $220 mil- lion, compared with $269 million for 2001.
The quarterly cash dividend was increased to $.14 per common share from $.131/2, marking the 44th consecutive year that dividends have been increased.
We were particularly pleased in 2002 that our operating profit margin, before goodwill amortization and general corporate expense, and excluding the net Behr litigation charge, was 16.7 percent
compared with 14.8 percent in 2001.
 OPERATING RESULTS
 Excluding the net Behr litigation charge, return on operating assets (including annualized results of acquisitions) improved 210 basis points to 19.5 percent in 2002 from 17.4 percent in 2001.
Our intensified focus on improving working capital performance in 2002 resulted in the follow- ing improvements over 2001:
• Accounts receivable days at year-end were 54 days compared with 55 days a year ago, despite the extension of payment terms with major retail customers;

  • Inventory days at year-end were reduced to 76 days from 88 days; and • Accounts payable days at year-end improved to 33 days from 24 days.
All of these improvements resulted in working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable) being reduced at year-end 2002 to 20.1 percent of annualized sales compared with 21.5 percent at year-end 2001.
To take advantage of lower interest rates and favorable market con- ditions, Masco raised over $2 billion in 2002 in capital through a combina- tion of equity and debt offerings, issuing:
• in May 2002, 22 million common shares at $27.20 per share;
• in June 2002, $500 million of 57/8 percent notes due 2012;
• in August 2002, $300 million of 61/2 percent notes due 2032 and $300 mil- lion of 45/8 percent notes due 2007; and
• in October 2002, $350 million of 57/8 percent notes due 2012.
The Company ended the year in a strong financial position with cash, marketable equity securities and bond funds in excess of $1.5 billion and unused bank credit lines of $2.0 billion. While we expect to continue to allocate a portion of our cash flow for share repurchase, our objective over the next few years is to continue to strengthen the balance sheet by reducing debt as a percent of total capitalization (presently 47 percent).
Historically, Masco has been opportunistic in taking advantage of share buyback opportunities when the Company believed that the share

price was attractive. In 2002, approximately nine million common shares were repur- chased. In addition, during the first two months of 2003, the Company has repurchased an additional nine million common shares. The Company currently has authorization to purchase up to an additional 39 million common shares.
THE COMPANY ENDED THE YEAR IN A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION WITH CASH, MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURI- TIES AND BOND FUNDS IN EXCESS OF $1.5 BILLION AND UNUSED BANK CREDIT LINES OF $2.0 BILLION.

 GROWTH STRATEGIES
Our goal is to achieve consistent, above-average growth in sales and earnings through a combination of internal growth, acquisitions and cost- containment programs. Growth initiatives are supported by aggressive marketing, merchandising and product development programs that capital- ize on the strength of our leading brands in the markets that we serve.
We estimate that approximately 90 percent of our sales are from products and services that represent leadership positions in their market segments. We believe that Masco’s leading brands have contributed signif- icantly to our market share gains and resulting sales growth.

 FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES
• Average annual internal sales growth of 6-10 percent;
• Average annual sales growth through acquisitions of 5-10 percent;
• Average annual returns to our shareholders of 12-15 percent (including dividends);
• Average annual operating profit margins before general corporate expense of 15-18 percent;
• Average annual after-tax return on equity of 15-20 percent; and
• Above-average cash flow and return on assets.
During the past decade, excluding acquisitions, we have achieved average annual internal sales growth of approximately eight percent, well above industry averages, principally as a result of market share gains, new product introductions, expansion of our installation services capabilities and industry growth.
Market Share Gains
Over the years, Masco has developed a number of merchandising and marketing programs designed to increase share of sales to our customers and to the ultimate consumer. These programs are designed to encourage our retailer, wholesaler and builder partners to increase the number of Masco products that they offer to consumers and trade customers. We assist them in this effort by conducting proprietary market research that enables us to identify the products and services that will offer the greatest appeal in specific market and geographic areas and then design tailored incentive programs to encourage customers to purchase more Masco products.

 Key Retailer Program
One of our most successful marketing initiatives, the Key Retailer Program, achieved significant increases in 2002 with sales of $3.2 billion compared with $2.9 billion in 2001.
This program has evolved since its beginning in 1986 to meet the changing needs of our home center, mass marketing, hardware store chain and other retailer customers. Specific programs are designed to enable our key retailer customers to meet specific goals by leveraging the collective strengths of our individual brands and operating companies.
Customized programs that we offer our key retailer customers include: strategic and practical marketing and visual merchandising pro- grams, e-training programs avail- able on-line to these customers’ employees, supply chain manage- ment, in-store service and catego-

 programs that include participation by the appropriate Masco operating companies are customized to meet the needs of each strategic builder partner.
To broaden our product and service offering to key builder cus- tomers, we have formed a number of strategic alliances with firms that pro- vide—as part of the Builder Alliance Program—such leading-edge services as digital marketing, design center tools, on-line business management and e-training technologies. Our intent is to enhance and accelerate our move- ment from single transaction-based relationships to strategic, consultative and collaborative approaches that deliver the business solutions that our customers increasingly require.
Installation Services Initiatives
In 2002, we further expanded our participation in installation services as part of our strategy to diversify our business and to offer more value-added services to our builder customers. Located throughout the United States, our approximately 375 Masco Contractor Services branches with over 12,000 employees generated revenues of $1,845 million in 2002 compared with $1,692 million in 2001, a nine percent increase.
Approximately 70 percent of our services business is installation of insulation; the balance is installation of fireplaces, gutters, cabinets and other products. We believe that Masco currently installs products in more than half of all new single-family homes in the United States.

To help our builder customers better meet the needs of today’s sophisticated home buyers, Masco has introduced structured wiring programs to provide the infrastructure to support rapidly changing home- based computer, communications, entertainment and security systems.
In 2001, we introduced a new energy performance program— Environments for LivingTM—that employs the latest building science and technology to conserve energy while simultaneously improving perform- ance. This program, which tripled in size in 2002, allows builders to offer homeowners specific performance guarantees at very attractive prices.
Acquisition of leading home improvement and building products and service companies has been an important component of Masco’s growth strategy for a number of years. Through the acquisition of leading compa- nies in the markets that we serve, Masco has achieved the size and product breadth and depth essential to maintaining our leadership position with our rapidly growing customers.
The past substantial growth of the Company allows us to be even more selective in future acquisitions. We seek high-margin companies with above-average growth potential that have brand leadership positions that complement our existing companies. We also look for exceptional manage- ment teams that wish to remain with the company.
In addition, acquisition candidates exhibit leadership in one or more of our key customer groups—homebuilders, wholesale and other

 • Service Partners, LLC, a distributor and installer of insulation and other building products, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia; and
• The Company also increased its ownership interest in Hansgrohe AG, a German manufacturer of kitchen and bath faucets, hand-held and fixed showerheads, luxury shower systems and steam showers, from 27 percent to 64 percent.
In early 2003, Masco acquired PowerShot Tool Company, Inc., a lead- ing manufacturer of fastening products, including staple guns, glue guns, hammer tackers and riveting products, headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey.
Over the past five years, Masco has invested over $6 billion in acquisitions and capital expenditures which, together with two significant pooling-of-interests transactions, have:
• Added complementary businesses with leadership market positions and talented, committed employees;
• Expanded the breadth and depth of our product and service offerings;
• Added highly respected brands; and
• Significantly increased Masco’s importance to our customers.
ACQUISITION OF LEADING HOME IMPROVEMENT AND BUILDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICE COM- PANIES HAS BEEN AN IMPOR- TANT COMPONENT OF MASCO’S GROWTH STRATEGY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

15 2002 Annual Report

 During that period, our sales have more than doubled from actual sales of less than $4 billion as reported in 1997 to in excess of $10 billion on an annualized basis as we have expanded into new markets and continued to gain market share. While we have achieved our aggressive growth goals, both internal and external, and created what we believe is the premier home improvement products company in the world, we have not generated ade- quate returns for our shareholders in terms of share price appreciation.
Going forward, we intend to focus our efforts on leveraging the bene- fits of our dramatic growth by putting increasing emphasis on cash flow gen- eration and increasing returns on invested capital as we further simplify the Company. While we will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, we expect that acquisition-related growth will be less dramatic than in the past. We will put added emphasis on internal growth driven by new product development and allocate additional financial resources to fund the repurchase of our common shares at attractive levels.
We are committed to creating value for our shareholders and to returning to the consistent and predictable sales growth and above-average profit growth that historically afforded Masco a premium valuation compared with the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index of leading companies.
We look to the future with optimism, confident that we can build upon our strengths to achieve the financial and operational goals that we have set for ourselves and achieve above-average returns for our shareholders.
We are encouraged by our recent achievements, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of our 61,000 employees who faced the challenges of 2002 with skill and determination. Their contributions helped your Company to achieve a record year in 2002 and are essential to our future success.
We would especially like to thank Joseph Hudson, Jr. and John Morgan, who retired from the Board of Directors last year, for their guidance and dedication during their many years of service to the Company.
Favorable Company sales performance has continued in early 2003, and based on current business trends, we believe that we will achieve record sales and earnings in 2003.
