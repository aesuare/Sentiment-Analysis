  A Message To Our Shareholders
from William H. Rogers, Jr.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer SunTrust Banks, Inc.
As a company, we are committed to Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being. This commitment allowed us to deliver strong results for our clients, communities, teammates and shareholders in 2014. We made meaningful progress on our strategic priorities, as evidenced by solid balance sheet growth, lower expenses and further improvement in credit quality. This successful execution helped SunTrust overcome the industry headwinds of reduced mortgage activity and the ongoing impact of the prolonged low-rate environment on net interest income.
The result: 18% adjusted earnings growth and a significantly improved efficiency ratio. Our shareholders were rewarded by this performance with total shareholder return of 16% in 2014.
Going forward, we will continue to keep our purpose of Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being at the center of everything we do. It is a promise we make to our clients, our communities and our teammates; and when we do this well, our business expands and our shareholders are rewarded.

2014 Annual Report

 Our Accomplishments
2014 Financial Highlights
For the year 2014, SunTrust reported net income available to common shareholders of $1.7 billion, or $3.23 per share. Excluding certain non-core items in both 2013 and 2014, adjusted earnings per share were $2.74 and $3.24, respectively, representing 18% growth year over year. Adjusted return on average assets improved 10 basis points to 0.98%, while adjusted return on average tangible common equity increased 85 basis points to 11.4%.
Our earnings growth and improved returns were driven by a significant reduction in expenses and further asset quality improvement. Total revenue, excluding the gain on sale of RidgeWorth Capital Management, was relatively stable compared
to the prior year, as the impact of a lower net interest margin and the decline in mortgage origination activity was more than offset by solid loan and deposit growth, additional momentum in our wealth management and investment banking businesses, and higher mortgage servicing income.
Adjusted expenses declined by approximately $200 million, as we right-sized our mortgage business and cyclical costs were reduced. However, a portion of these savings was reinvested in key growth areas, which we believe will drive sustainable profitability over the long term.
Accordingly, we achieved an adjusted tangible efficiency ratio of 63% for the year, well ahead of the target we set at the beginning of 2014 and approximately 200 basis points better than our 2013 performance. We have made considerable progress toward our long-term tangible efficiency ratio target of sub-60%, and we remain firmly focused on that commitment. Achieving this important objective will be a key driver of delivering additional value to you, our shareholders.
Average performing loans grew 7%, led by continued momentum in commercial and industrial, commercial real estate and direct consumer loans. Average client deposits grew 4%, with a favorable mix shift to lower-cost deposit products continuing.
Credit quality continued to improve, as nonperforming loans declined 35% to 0.48% of loans and net charge-offs declined 34% to 0.34% of average loans. These improvements, in conjunction with sustained high-quality loan production, contributed
to the $211 million reduction in the provision for credit losses. This performance is the result of improving economic conditions, in addition to the significant actions we have taken over the past several years to de-risk our balance sheet and improve the quality of our loan production. Acknowledging our substantially improved asset quality and increased profitability, Standard
and Poor’s upgraded the senior long-term credit rating of our primary operating subsidiary, SunTrust Bank, to “A-” from “BBB+” in the fourth quarter.
We continued to maintain strong capital levels, with a Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 9.7%, relatively stable compared to the prior year. We did this while also growing total assets by 9% to support further client business. In addition, tangible book value per share increased 10% relative to the prior year. We repurchased $458 million of common stock in 2014, and we doubled our total annual common stock dividend from $0.35 per share in 2013 to $0.70 per share in 2014. The cumulative actions we have taken to improve our risk and earnings profile, combined with our strong capital and liquidity levels, should help us further increase capital return to shareholders.
Aside from a solid financial performance, 2014 also marked a meaningful step forward with regard to the resolution of certain legacy mortgage matters, which will allow us to more firmly focus on meeting more of our clients’ needs while driving more consistent profitability.

 1 Deepen Client 2 Enhance Returns by Optimizing 3 Improve Relationships Balance Sheet and Business Mix Efficiency
    The Way Forward
Our clients’ confidence continues to improve, and we are focused on helping them capitalize on the improving economy. We have the scale to compete with the largest banks, but are also small enough to remain nimble and to respond effectively to changing market conditions and consumer preferences.
The U.S. economy continues to be on a positive track. While slowing global growth and the steep decline in oil prices create uncertainty, continued job gains and improving housing prices, combined with the potential net benefit to consumers from lower oil prices, should help keep the U.S. economy on a path of further improvement.
We have a strong market position and continue to execute on our strategic priorities:
1. Deepen Client Relationships
Our clients are at the center of everything we do, and we continue to enhance our products and capabilities to better meet their needs.
In Consumer Banking and Private Wealth Management, we have added nearly 200 Premier Bankers over the past two years
to help serve the wealth and investment advisory needs of our branch-based clients. For our high net worth and mass affluent clients, we introduced SunTrust SummitView®, a financial planning and account aggregation tool that helps clients obtain a full picture of their finances, resulting in more confidence and control. In addition, SummitView allows our advisors to have a complete view of a client’s financial standing, which enables them to provide even more relevant advice. For all of our clients, we have enhanced our digital capabilities – including improved mobile and tablet apps, an accessible and content-rich Resource Center on suntrust.com, and the offering of Apple PayTM. Our continued innovation in this space earned us multiple Digital Banking Experience Leader awards from Javelin Strategy & Research.
In Wholesale Banking, the investments we have been making in our Corporate & Investment Banking (CIB) platform, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, continue to yield positive returns, as 2014 marked the seventh consecutive record year of investment banking income. We are applying our expertise from CIB to our Commercial Real Estate and Commercial and Business Banking clients to help them access the capital markets, expand their businesses and explore M&A opportunities. We believe our success is rooted in our differentiated business model – our One Team approach encourages teammates to work collaboratively to meet clients’ needs across the platform.
Given the changes to the mortgage industry, our primary goal in Mortgage Banking has been to right-size our infrastructure; however, as has been the case across the company, we have also been focused on meeting more clients’ needs. Mortgages are a key product offering for our private wealth clients, and the business as a whole serves as an entry point to the rest of the company for many new clients. As an example, the percentage of our mortgage clients that have at least one other product has increased from 26% to 31% over the past year.
Deepening client relationships requires coordination across the company and a client-first approach. When we succeed, we take one step further in Lighting the Way to Financial Well-Being for our clients.

  2. Enhance Returns by Optimizing Balance Sheet and Business Mix
Over the past several years we have been focused on diversifying our balance sheet and reducing our concentration of residential real estate loans. This component of the strategy is largely complete, as residential-related loans have declined from 50% of our portfolio in 2007 to 29% at the end of 2014. We grew our commercial and consumer loan exposure over the same time frame, and in 2014 average performing commercial and consumer loans grew 14% and 8%, respectively.
Going forward, the balance sheet optimization strategy will focus on enhancing returns more so than materially changing the business mix. Our balance sheet is an important resource, and we need to ensure that we use it effectively. We evaluate our returns on capital in the context of the entire client relationship, which includes deposits and fee income in addition to lending, and when we are unable to meet our internal hurdles, we explore balance sheet management alternatives. Accordingly, we sold over $4 billion of lower-return loans in 2014.
Our progress on this strategic initiative has resulted in a much more diversified company, with better growth opportunities and improved access to new markets and clients. Additionally, the enhanced diversity of our balance sheet should aid in reducing the volatility of our financial performance in the future.
3. Improve Efficiency
Streamlining the way we do business not only allows us to increase profitability, but also improves the effectiveness of how we serve our clients and our communities.
Since setting our long-term tangible efficiency ratio target of sub-60%, we have made significant progress – improving this ratio on an
adjusted basis from 72% in 2011 to
63% in 2014. To date, the entire improvement has been driven
by rigorous expense discipline, evidenced by the 16% reduction in our adjusted expense base since 2011. In 2014, our expense reduction efforts were focused on right-sizing our mortgage business, optimizing our delivery model and streamlining our operations.
In Mortgage Banking, we exceeded
our initial $200 million savings goal by
acting decisively against the backdrop of
a lower origination environment. Additionally,
we continued to proactively reduce our
nonperforming loans and delinquent servicing
portfolio balances. We also streamlined our go-to-market
model by consolidating our retail and consumer direct channels
and discontinuing our broker channel. 7
   2014 Annual Report

 Our clients have increasingly adopted digital applications as their primary means of conducting their banking activities, and we have reallocated resources to support increasing investments in these channels. Branches continue to play an important role in fostering relationships with new clients and addressing existing clients’ more complex needs, while self-service channels such
as ATMs and digital products are playing a more predominant role in meeting everyday needs. As such, we reduced our branch count by 3% in 2014 while growing our digital investments, and going forward, we will continue to evolve our delivery network to service changing client needs and preferences.
Lastly, we have begun streamlining our operations and support-related infrastructure. For example, we consolidated 64 decentralized mortgage processing locations into five end-to-end campuses. Additionally, we have continued to increase utilization of technology in certain areas, such as encouraging the usage of e-statements and using scanners to process checks more efficiently in our branches.
Importantly, while streamlining our organization, we have not lost focus on the bigger picture: efficiency improvements are derived from both expense discipline and revenue growth. Despite the challenging industry environment, we
have taken a measured approach to expense reduction, being mindful of the continuing need to make important investments for long-term prosperity. In 2014, we hired new talent across each of our businesses to help further expand our revenue opportunities. As previously
noted, we also increased our investments
in digital channels so our clients can
conduct their banking when, where and
how they choose. In addition, we continued
to invest in our risk management and compliance infrastructure to ensure that
we are meeting and exceeding increasing regulatory requirements.
Going forward, revenue growth will become an
increasingly important component of lowering our efficiency ratio, as we have already taken steps to meaningfully reduce our cost base. We are continuing to invest in key growth priorities to drive increased revenue, which we expect will lead to improved financial performance over the long term.

  Together, We’re Stronger
None of our progress would be possible without the support and dedication of our teammates.
I thank our SunTrust teammates for their continued service to our clients and communities, as well as their contributions to our company. I also thank our clients, who entrust us to help Light the Way to their Financial Well-Being and you, our shareholders, for your investment and continued support.
Lastly, I express my gratitude to our Board of Directors for their knowledge and guidance and welcome our newest Director, Paul R. Garcia, who joined us in July. Paul brings with him intimate knowledge of the payments and financial technology industries, both areas of important evolution for the financial services industry and for our clients.
As we look ahead to the coming year, we will remain focused on the strategic priorities that have driven our success over the past few years – deeper client relationships, balance sheet optimization and efficiency improvement.
As one of the largest banks in our markets and an active corporate citizen in the communities we serve, we are keenly aware of our role in the continued economic recovery. We remain committed to delivering on those responsibilities for our clients, communities and teammates, and ultimately you, our shareholders.
