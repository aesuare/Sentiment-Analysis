SHAREHOLDERS' LETTER
These are interesting times in the commercial real estate services business. For our Company, volatility means opportunity. CB Richard Ellis has more than a century of experience successfully navigating market cycles. As the world's largest commercial real estate services firm, the Company is uniquely positioned to succeed in this environment because of our highly diversified revenue base, global breadth, leading brand and strong balance sheet and cash flow. We believe market conditions in the months ahead will hamper smaller, less diversified competitors, likely providing a conducive environment for further consolidation in the industry. This is an opportunity we are prepared to pursue aggressively. Overall, CB Richard Ellis delivered superior performance in 2007. By providing exceptional service to our clients, the Company achieved record results across all of our geographies and business segments. CB Richard Ellis expanded its global reach and further diversified its revenue base. In addition, we introduced groundbreaking initiatives in environmental sustainability and corporate responsibility. Despite a fourth quarter that was impacted by softer investment sales amid difficulties in the credit markets, full-year 2007 performance was strong:

service lines continued to pay dividends. More than 30% of our 2007 revenues and normalized EBITDA were generated outside the United States. Fueled by countries such as Australia, China and India, Asia Pacific was our fastest-growing region, with revenues up 55% for the year. Fee-based revenues from outsourcing contracts increased to 23% of total revenue ­ up from 14% in 2006. HERE ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF KEY BUSINESS LINES IN 2007:
·

INVESTMENT SALES: CB Richard Ellis achieved solid performance in investment sales in 2007 despite credit market fluctuations. Marketwide investment volume in the U.S. rose 24% to $384 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics ( RCA ). CB Richard Ellis' U.S. investment sales activity grew faster than the market at 25%. During 2007, RCA reported our investment volume grew strongly in office (up 71%), industrial (up 45%) and retail (up 67%).

Global revenue reached a new high, $6.0 billion, reflecting a 50% increase for the year.

Earnings per diluted share, adjusted for one-time items, rose to $2.11, an increase of  43% from 2006. Net income, as adjusted for one-time items, increased 43% to $496.8 million, a  record level. Normalized EBITDA improved 49% from 2006 to $970.1 million.

Across EMEA , marketwide investment activity set a new high--  246 billion ($374 billion) --and the Company set new records for individual investment transactions in seven European countries. Commercial real estate markets in Asia Pacific maintained their positive momentum, as strong economic expansion and real estate market fundamentals sustained the confidence of pension, private equity and sovereign wealth funds. The long-term trend of increased institutional capital allocations to real estate continues. The annual Kingsley Associates/Institutional Real Estate survey of pension funds identifies $76 billion of planned investment in 2008--a nearly two-thirds increase over 2007. In addition, a substantial pool of institutional capital allocations from previous years that has not been invested will be put to work, according to Kingsley.

2007 ACCOMPLISHMENTS In our highly fragmented industry, it is no coincidence that CB Richard Ellis is the leading firm in virtually all of the top 25 cities globally. The Company is number one in worldwide transaction activity--leasing, capital markets and valuation--and outsourcing, including fully integrated corporate services, consulting, and property and facilities management. Our strategic actions to diversify our business base both geographically and in

LEASING: Revenue increased 26%, primarily due to stronger activity in both EMEA and Asia Pacific, as well as modest growth in the Americas. In EMEA, fullyear 2007 leasing totals rivaled the exceptional levels seen in 2006 and, in the case of Germany, exceeded them. Activity remained strong in Asia's leading office markets, and prime office vacancy remained tight in key central business districts.

CORPORATE SERVICES: With the industry's deepest and broadest services platform, CB Richard Ellis continued to significantly expand our contractual work for major corporate clients. Outsourcing revenue grew 146%, as we successfully leveraged the strength of the legacy Trammell Crow Company outsourcing capabilities. We added 26 new corporate outsourcing clients, and through the success of our cross-selling efforts, we expanded our range of services for 18 existing corporate customers and renewed relationships with 17 others during 2007. Prestigious names added to our corporate client roster in 2007 include Barclays, Chrysler, GMAC, Nielsen and Oracle. GLOBAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: CBRE Investors has continued to skillfully execute its investment strategy, harvesting gains on property sales and growing asset management fees. Global investment management revenue grew 51% for the year, based on strong growth in assets under management. Our global investment management subsidiary posted strong top- and bottom-line growth for the year, and total assets under management reached $37.8 billion at year's end, a 32% increase from the end of 2006. CBRE Investors had 120 institutional investor partners and clients, and raised $9.6 billion in equity capital in 2007. DEVELOPMENT SERVICES: The development business produced one of its strongest years in history, with revenue of $134 million. Due to purchase accounting rules, we were not able to recognize $61.6 million of gains from property sales in this business during 2007, despite receiving the cashflow from these sales. Development activity remained quite strong with $9.2 billion of in-process and pipeline projects at the end of 2007.

We have also demonstrated our ability to make and integrate strategic purchases when the opportunity arises. Our most recent major acquisition, Trammell Crow Company, exceeded even our own aggressive targets for integration success: we realized annualized net expense synergy savings of $90 million, surpassing our original expectations by 38%. SHARE REPURCHASE In 2007, we announced and completed a $635 million share repurchase program using existing cash and our revolving credit facility. The total amount of shares repurchased was 28.8 million, at an average purchase price of $22.03 per share. At year's end, CB Richard Ellis had 202 million shares outstanding versus approximately 227 million shares at the end of 2006. BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS CB Richard Ellis continued to strengthen its balance sheet during 2007. Our weighted average cost of debt was reduced to approximately 6.3% at December 31, 2007, down from 7% a year earlier. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio at December 31, 2007, was 1.7 times, as compared to 2.5 times at December 31, 2006. RECOGNITION In 2007, CB Richard Ellis was named one of the 50 "Best-in-Class" companies by BusinessWeek, and was ranked among the 100 fastest-growing U.S. companies by FORTUNE magazine. In early 2008, CB Richard Ellis was named the leading global brand in commercial real estate for the seventh year in a row, according to a survey of real estate professionals from around the world by The Lipsey Company. National Real Estate Investor magazine ranked CB Richard Ellis the largest brokerage firm in the world, based on aggregate value of sales and leasing transactions. The Company also won the Exceptional Achievement Award at the 2007 MPF European Practice Management Awards in London, in recognition of its outstanding contribution to the professional services sector. In addition, we were named an EPA Energy Star Partner of the Year for 2007 in recognition of our success in promoting energy conservation and cutting greenhouse gas emissions at CBRE-managed properties.

The associated annual revenue related to these acquisitions is estimated to be approximately $244 million. Since 2005 through the end of 2007, we completed 44 in-fill acquisitions for a combined purchase price of approximately $352 million, with associated annual revenue of approximately $547 million.

DEFINING GLOBAL LEADERSHIP At CB Richard Ellis, we recognize that being the industry leader means opening a path that leads others to creative ways of thinking and acting. In 2007, we launched a corporate responsibility initiative that globally coordinates and places keen focus on six key areas: governance; ethics and compliance; philanthropy and community involvement; diversity and employee relations; health and safety; and environmental stewardship. In 2007, CB Richard Ellis began a drive to make our Company carbon-neutral by 2010, and to help our clients significantly reduce emissions at the 1.9 billion square feet of properties that we manage around the world. Our first Corporate Responsibility Report, which we will publish annually going forward, can be found at www.cbre.com/responsibility. MACRO ENVIRONMENT Looking at the horizon, there are some cautionary signals. In the U.S., job creation--an important indicator of future occupier demand--has been outstripped by job losses amid concerns about housing market weakness, high energy prices and credit market difficulties. In Europe, general expectations point to economic growth of less than 2% in 2008. As a result, we anticipate modestly weakening office leasing activity in Europe and easing in rental growth rates. Asia has shown continued strong economic growth and investment capital flows; however, it remains to be seen whether the challenges facing other parts of the world will have a future impact on this region. Liquidity remains constrained--and property transactions increasingly difficult to finance--amid the deepening credit market freeze. Our expectation is that these trends will correct toward the positive some time later in 2008, but the timing of that correction is unknown. While the macro environment in which we operate has continued to weaken, underlying real estate market fundamentals remain strong and are generally characterized by low vacancies, modestly rising rents and rational levels of new construction. CBRE Torto Wheaton Research, our econometric forecasting unit, expects continued increases in rents, albeit at a slower pace than in 2007.

Looking ahead, while no one hopes for difficult times, we see 2008 as an exciting and opportunistic period. History has shown that during complex economic cycles, CB Richard Ellis captures market share more quickly than our major competitors, and we are able, through our highly variable cost structure, to retain profits more easily than most. It is during uncertain conditions, when the landscape is shifting, that clients truly recognize the value of our professionals, the strength of our brand, and the power of our globally capable, vertically integrated platform. These are advantages that only CB Richard Ellis can offer. That's why I look forward to 2008 and beyond with enthusiasm.

Sincerely,

Brett White President and Chief Executive Officer
