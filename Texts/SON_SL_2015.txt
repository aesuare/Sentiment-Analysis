 Our efforts to Grow and Optimize Sonoco
in 2015 focused on putting all the pieces in place to Grow through new products, new markets, new services and new ways of thinking. These efforts are illustrated by the opening of our new innovation center, the iPS Studio, built on our campus in Hartsville. At the same time, we worked to harness the power of our portfolio and our people to further Optimize business performance.
Despite diverging global economic conditions and headwinds stemming from the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, Sonoco put up solid results in 2015. Our targeted growth segments, Consumer Packaging and Protective Solutions, achieved record sales and base earnings, while we worked
to optimize our Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment, which faced difficult conditions in many of our global served markets.
2015 Results
For 2015, net sales were $4.96 billion, down 1% from last year. The negative impact of foreign currency translation reduced reported sales by approximately $276 million in 2015, more than offsetting $228 million in sales added by acquisi- tions net of divestitures. Favorable volume/mix was essentially offset by lower selling prices stemming from declining recovered paper and resin costs.
Net income attributable to Sonoco for 2015 was $250.1 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, up 12% from 2014. Current-year earnings included a net loss of $.07 per diluted share, after-tax, from a combination of the following: a favorable disposi- tion of Fox River-related claims/litigation, gain on the sale of two metal end plants and favorable tax reserve adjustments, more than offset by foreign exchange driven asset impairments in Venezuela, restructuring costs, asset impairment charges,

Base earnings for 2015 were $256.7 million, or $2.51 per diluted share, compared with $248.6 mil- lion, or $2.41 per diluted share, for 2014. This
3.2% increase stemmed from a positive price/cost relationship, manufacturing productivity improve- ments, acquisition earnings and a lower effective tax rate. Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher labor, pension, maintenance and
other operating costs and unfavorable changes in exchange rates. Improved volume in our Consumer Packaging and Protective Solutions segments was partially offset by lower volume from the Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment and nega- tive changes in the mix of products sold in most businesses.

Current-year gross profit was a record $929 mil- lion, up 2.4%. The prior-year acquisition of Weiden- hammer Packaging Group, a European composite can business, was a benefit to gross profit, offset by the negative impact of currency rate changes. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 18.7%, an improve- ment of 60 basis points over 2014 and the highest margin level since 2007. Sales, general and admin- istrative expenses (SG&A) were $496 million in 2015, and SG&A expenses were 10.0% of sales, compared with 10.1% in 2014.
In 2015, cash generated from operations was up 8.4% to $453 million. Both operating cash flow and free cash flow were higher in 2015 on higher GAAP net income that also reflected higher impairment, depreciation and other non-cash charges in the year. Pension and post-retirement plan contribu- tions, net of expenses, were $47 million less in 2015 than the previous year. These positive cash flow changes were offset by an increase in cash
paid for income taxes of approximately $38 million. Net capital expenditures and cash dividends were $189 million and $138 million, respectively, during 2015, compared with $169 million and $129 mil- lion, respectively, in 2014. Free cash flow for 2015 was $155 million, up 29% from last year. For the year, the Company used available cash to reduce debt, net of proceeds, by approximately $115 mil- lion. In addition, the Company utilized $17 million of net cash for acquisitions, including $16 million to purchase a majority interest in a flexible pack- aging business in Brazil.
At year end, total debt was approximately $1.13 bil- lion, compared with $1.25 billion at the end of 2014. Cash and cash equivalents were $182 million at year end 2015, compared with $161 million at year end 2014. Our capital structure remains one of the strongest in the packaging sector with a net debt to total capital ratio of 38.3%, an improvement from 40.2% at the end of 2014. Standard and Poor’s rates Sonoco’s debt with a solid investment grade of BBB+.

of the segment’s strong
performance was the suc-

extremely proud of the job

Our Global Plastics business significantly improved as we consolidated our thermoforming, blow mold- ing, injection molding and extrusion operations under a single structure to better optimize their collective resources to meet the needs of our customers.

dividends. Sonoco’s current dividend yield is one of the highest in the Packaging sector and is approxi- mately 50% higher than the S&P 500. Sonoco is part of an exclusive club of companies named to Top 25 S.A.F.E. Dividend Stocks, by Dividend Channel. S.A.F.E. stands for Solid Return, Accelerating Amount, Flawless History and Enduring Payments.
To further return value in 2016, Sonoco’s Board of Directors has authorized repurchasing up to $100 million of our outstanding common stock. If fully utilized, based on recent stock prices, this authorization would reduce the Company’s cur- rently outstanding share count by approximately 2.5 million shares. In addition, the Board restored the Company’s residual common stock repurchase authorization to its original 5 million shares.
Sonoco is a great company with a great 116-year legacy—one based on a belief in our 21,000 people, in innovation and in the necessity of transform- ation to become better. We believe our future is dependent on our continued commitment to each of these beliefs, allowing us to deliver exceptional value to our customers while providing acceptable returns to our shareholders. We thank you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your investment.
