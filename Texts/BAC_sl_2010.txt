Opportunity Seized:

 Bank of America has the best franchise in the industry with number one or two positions in the business segments in which we compete and the largest customer and client base in our industry.

Dear

Shareholders,
Our work in 2010 was focused on two key goals: first, rebalancing and realigning our company so we can serve our customers and clients with the broadest and best financial services in the industry; and second, strengthening our balance sheet and capital position to create the right conditions for growth in long-term shareholder value. This work is well underway, and we are making significant progress. As a result, we are a much stronger company today than we were a year ago. We have a vision for our company, a strategy to achieve that vision and well-defined operating principles to help guide our work as we pursue our goals. These are important to understanding how we intend to operate the company, serve customers and clients, and return value to shareholders.

Our Vision and Strategy
Our vision is for Bank of America to be the world's finest financial services company. We think that this is an appropriate and achievable goal. I firmly believe that we have all the businesses and capabilities in place to meet the core financial needs of customers and clients more effectively than any other company. Our success in realizing this vision will be measured by our customers, by our own employees and by you, the shareholder. We'll know we are succeeding when our customers choose to bring us more of their business, and make us their primary financial institution; when employees choose to build their careers here, because they can achieve anything they set out to do; and when shareholders realize the long-term value this franchise can deliver. That means solid returns on equity and assets, steady growth in tangible book value per share, attractive total shareholder returns, and consistent performance through economic cycles.

 By attracting new customers and more business from existing customers, our deposit balances continue to grow, topping $1 trillion at the end of 2010.

 Customers have many valuable choices for how to bank with us--a great base for building any relationship.

To pursue our vision, we have laid out a clear strategy. We emerged from the economic downturn as a global financial services company with leading positions in all our major businesses. We serve one in two households in the U.S. and operate in more than 40 countries, with nearly 300,000 employees around the world. Despite our global scale and reach, our strategy is relatively straightforward. We serve three customer groups: people, businesses of all sizes, and institutional investors. For each of these groups, we provide core financial services. We serve people with a range of financial services, from secured and unsecured lending, to deposit, checking and savings accounts. We serve parents who want to help their children open their first savings accounts, young people graduating from school and setting up checking and retirement accounts, and the wealthiest families in the world with complex multigenerational wealth management needs. We help companies of all sizes grow by helping them transact, manage their cash, access the debt and equity  markets, and manage the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuations. We provide strategic advice for transactions such as public offerings, and mergers and acquisitions. Our institutional investor clients rely on our research to identify opportunities to invest wisely and confidently. We help them execute their transactions and connect them with the global financial markets through our sales and trading technology. No other financial services company has assembled this breadth of capabilities for all of the customer groups we serve. And, our capabilities are at or near the top of the industry in every core financial product and service we offer. We provide the full range of these financial services for all three customer groups in the United States. Outside the U.S., we deliver corporate and investment banking, global markets and wealth management services to business clients, institutional investors and wealthy individuals. Our Card Services business also serves customers in Canada, Ireland, the U.K. and Spain. We run the franchise for every customer in full, delivering all of the services they may have traditionally sought separately from a retail bank, a commercial bank, an investment bank,

Operating Principles to Move Us Forward
So, we have a vision and a strategy. To execute our strategy we have outlined six operating principles that will help guide our activities and focus our resources. Be a customer-driven company What does it mean to be a "customer-driven company"? It simply means this: We are making business decisions by listening to our customers and responding to their needs and preferences. Retail customers have told us that they want, and will pay for, value they can see and understand. They value clarity, choice and a healthy sense of security and control in their banking services. We have taken a number of important steps to help customers take control. We eliminated overdraft fees for debit cards at the point of sale. We created Clarity Commitment® statements that spell out in plain English key benefits and obligations of certain products. We offer deposit-image ATMs, and online and mobile banking technologies to provide customers with more detailed and timely information. Our new Merrill Edge® account enables customers to manage their banking and investing activities through an integrated platform. And we have developed employee incentive, reward and recognition programs that align with our customer experience goals. These are important steps as we build a consumer business driven by profitable relationships. Some of these actions have cost us revenue in the short term. But we also are working to mitigate revenue losses, whether due to our own decisions or regulatory and legislative changes. And, we are seeing immediate improvements in customer satisfaction, problem resolution and willingness to broaden and deepen relationships. In serving businesses--from our millions of small business customers to our largest corporate clients--the idea is the same: We believe we can create more value by pursuing  broad, deep and long-lasting relationships. One very promising area involves our work to integrate the way we deliver wealth management products and services with the work we do for commercial, corporate and investment banking clients. Many of our business clients need employee benefits management, for example, or access to global capital markets and wealth management solutions. These efforts are paying off. Clients consistently tell me how much more they know we can do for them than our competitors. As a result, they are giving us more opportunities, and we are seeing a steady increase in successful customer referrals across our major lines of business. In focusing on expanding relationships, we exited several businesses that were not driven by the core financial needs of our customers and clients. Overall, we divested assets valued at more than $20 billion, strengthening our capital and liquidity position and allowing us to sharpen our focus on serving customers.

Build a fortress balance sheet Maintaining a fortress balance sheet through economic cycles entails strong liquidity and credit reserve positions, good asset quality, sufficient capital and a diverse mix of core businesses. We have been improving in all these areas. Although we held assets relatively flat last year, we significantly reduced risk-weighted assets while also taking down long-term debt, growing deposits and strengthening global excess liquidity to more than $336 billion. Most important, we improved tangible common equity by more than 10 percent to more than $130 billion, and also significantly improved our loan loss coverage ratios. A key goal is to strengthen our capital base to meet new regulatory requirements without having to issue additional shares through the next economic cycle. Basel III rules as currently proposed will require a common equity Tier 1 ratio of at least 7 percent by 2019, a threshold we are confident we will exceed. Pursue operational excellence and manage risk well An important element in our strategy is achieving operational excellence throughout the organization. This is where the opportunity to build deeper relationships begins. Getting it right for customers every time is how we build customer loyalty. With merger transition work largely completed, we now are free to focus resources on driving operational excellence for our customers by upgrading technology, increasing training and improving effectiveness and efficiency in all the  company's core functions. Operational excellence in risk management is especially important, as we continue to build on our work to institute new, rigorous risk management controls and procedures throughout the organization. In combination with the improving economy, this work is contributing to our improving credit quality results. Deliver on our shareholder return model Our shareholder return model is not complicated-- but it requires consistent and disciplined execution. It begins with the fortress balance sheet. The next steps are achieving reasonable and sustainable revenue growth from our core consumer businesses in the U.S.; faster growth in our corporate and investment banking and wealth management businesses in the U.S. and internationally; and tight expense control. We believe that consistently executing these steps will lead to less volatile earnings per share growth and steady capital generation. The end result, we believe, will be attractive growth in tangible book value per share and support for a higher multiple for the stock. We also believe that the implementation of this model will enable us to put in place a prudent capital management strategy in the near future that, pending regulatory approvals, includes a higher dividend and stock repurchases. Clean up legacy issues related to the economic downturn, primarily in the mortgage business The recession took a great toll on millions of families. While growth has returned,  we continue to work through issues related to the downturn--primarily delinquent mortgages. We are making progress. Bank of America (including Countrywide prior to the acquisition) has completed nearly 775,000 mortgage modifications since January of 2008 to help  customers remain in their homes. We reached agreements at the end of last year with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to resolve many of their repurchase claims on mortgages originated by Countrywide before we acquired

It is important to the economic recovery that the housing market stabilizes. That will require moving through the modification and foreclosure process quickly but carefully. We took an important step in this direction in creating a new Legacy Asset Servicing group, which includes responsibility for residential mortgage repurchase claims and management of default servicing. This change will clear the way for leaders in our Home Loans business to focus on building the leading mortgage origination business in the country. In addition to mitigating mortgage issues, we also reduced certain capital markets risk exposures that were originated prior to the downturn to $23 billion in 2010. Be the best place for people to work We want to be the best place for our teammates to achieve their professional goals, while helping build the world's finest financial services company for our customers and shareholders. To meet this goal, we are aligning our training, reward and recognition programs to our customer strategy. We made changes to our benefits programs to make health care coverage more affordable for most of our employees; and, we continued to strengthen our leading diversity and inclusion programs to ensure that every member of our team can achieve his or her potential. We also conducted a company-wide employee survey (95 percent of our employees participated) that led to valuable feedback about what we can do to build an even more engaging workplace.

Focused on the Future
Our 2010 results show that, while we have made progress in strengthening the balance sheet and focusing our capital to support core capabilities for customers, the overhang of issues related to recent acquisitions and regulatory changes remained significant. Excluding two non-cash, non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, we earned $10.2 billion for the full year. Including these charges, we posted a net loss of $2.2 billion. Even so, the underlying results show the strength and promise of the company. Credit costs fell, resulting in a reduction of provision expense to $28.4 billion from $48.6 billion in 2009. Deposit balances reached a record $1 trillion at the end of the year, showing that customers continue to see our company as a trusted and stable partner. And referrals among our businesses are increasing, demonstrating the power of our relationship-based, customer-centered strategy. As I wrote above, our company is much stronger today than it was a year ago, as we made tough decisions in 2010 aimed at putting issues related to the recession behind us. We have the number one or number two market position in almost every business in which we choose to compete. We serve millions of consumers, businesses and institutional investors, each of which provides an opportunity for us to expand our relationship with them. We are leaving nothing to chance in our efforts to pursue these opportunities. For your additional information, we have posted presentations from a recent all-day investor conference in New York at which members of our management team and I discussed in detail the items I've outlined here. I encourage you to view the presentations in the investor section of our public website at http://investor.bankofamerica.com.

To Our Shareholders,
2010 was a rebuilding year for our company. Brian Moynihan and our management team accomplished a great deal, from implementing a new customerfocused business strategy, to strengthening our capital position, to working through issues related to the economic downturn. The board worked closely with Brian and the team on a range of issues, including the implementation of the company's new risk management process and management's thoughtful and aggressive plans to put matters resulting from the mortgage crisis behind us. Together, we also focused on ensuring productive interactions with regulators and elected officials. I would like to note the retirement from our board of my predecessor as chairman, Walter Massey. Walter retired last spring after 17 years on the board, and one year as chairman. He guided the board with a steady hand during a challenging period for the company. Walter has our best wishes for the future, and my personal appreciation for the skill with which he discharged his responsibilities. With leading positions in the major markets in which we compete, I see boundless opportunities for Bank of America to grow and prosper. I believe we are on the right path, and that we have a CEO and management team with a vision and strategy that is appropriate and achievable.
