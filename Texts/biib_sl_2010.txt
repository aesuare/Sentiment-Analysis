With &',')) patients on therapy, 234567I 9 :natali<umab@ global inBmarket net sales totaled EF.H billion last year, an increase of F' percent over H))L. We are keenly focused on maMimi<ing the value of both 5NONQR and 234567I. 5NONQR is backed by more than F& years of safety and ef !cacy data, and importantly, its S.4. sales performance has improved. 5s of the end of H)F), we had three consecutive quarters of sales around the FV),))) unit mark after four years of unit sales declines. We believe that the work we are doing on PXY risk strati!cation for 234567I will allow physicians and patients to better understand their personal riskBbene!t situation and could potentially lead to many more patients being able to reali<e the bene!ts of 234567I with a more informed decision on their risk of PXY. 7I2SR5N 9 :rituMimab@ revenues from our unconsolidated Zoint business arrangement with [enentech, a wholly owned member of the 7oche [roup, contributed EF.F billion in H)F), a decrease of H percent from H))L primarily due to the eMpiration of royalties on sales outside the Snited 4tates. \owever, we continue to see opportunities for 7I2SR5N through eMpansion into new indications and, more broadly, for the antiB]^H) franchise through potentially better neMtBgeneration compounds like [5F)F. In H)F), we received _^5 approval for 7I2SR5N as a treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia :]YY@ and we !led a supplemental biologics license application :s6Y5@ with the _^5 for approval to market 7I2SR5N in 5N]5Bassociated vasculitis. In early H)FF, we also received _^5 approval for 7I2SR5N as a maintenance treatment for patients with advanced follicular lymphoma who responded to initial treatment with 7I2SR5N plus chemotherapy. We did this while strengthening our collaboration with [enentech and 7oche to maMimi<e revenue and the bene!ts for patients. Our enviable cash "ow generation has allowed 6iogen Idec to deliver signi!cant value to shareholders through share repurchases.

A TRANSFORMATION IS UNDER/AY AT BIOGEN IDEC
The key to Biogen Idec0s future growth is to focus on what we do best 8 and what patients need the most. It was clear to me upon my arrival that, as we enter a challenging new decade for our industry, Biogen Idec needed a new strategic direction 8 one that would enable the organi?ation to build on its strengths, avoid competing in areas in which we are not world-class, and become more nimble and ef !cient. In November, we announced our Framework for Growth initiative, which increased our focus, streamlined our structure and strengthened our organi?ation. As part of this initiative, we plan to: D Expand our global leadership in the treatment of MS by maximi?ing the potential of AVONEK and TYSABRI and aggressively bringing forward our promising MS pipeline. D Leverage the research and development (RPD) and commercial expertise we have built through our MS leadership to pursue life-saving and life-changing therapies for other neurodegenerative diseases, including ALS, or Lou Gehrig0s disease, and Al?heimer0s and Parkinson0s diseases, where there are tremendous unmet needs. D Advance our high-potential programs in hemophilia and build on our scienti!c strength in immunobiology 8 examples of areas outside of neurology where we believe we can compete and win.
Our manufacturing expertise and capabilities in protein engineering are among the best in the industry, and they are crucial to our success.

I also am pleased that we were able to attract two of the industry's top leaders to round out our management team. 9ouglas E. Williams, =h.9., joined us as Executive Aice =resident, Besearch and 9evelopment and brings with him more than CD years of scienti!c and senior leadership experience, including playing a signi!cant role in the discovery and development of EnbrelE, one of the industry's most successful drugs. Steven H. Holtzman is our Executive Aice =resident, Corporate 9evelopment, a newly formed department that encompasses corporate strategy, business development, portfolio and program management, and the New Aentures fund. Steven has more than CD years of industry experience, most recently as founder, Chairman and CEO of In!nity =harmaceuticals, Inc., and has developed a well-deserved reputation as an excellent leader and innovative deal-maker. We are still in the early stages of our efforts to transform our business, but I am con!dent that we are headed in the right direction to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.
Every treatment we have pioneered, every dollar we have earned, every patient we have helped has been a direct result of the talents and tireless efforts of our people.

%iogen Idec continues to expand its leadership position in multiple sclerosis (MS) with blockbuster products T"SA%&I and AOONE^.

!"C$T$&' )PP)+T,&$T$!S A+! )& T/! /)+$0)&
T"SA%&I is a very ef !cacious drug that is transforming the lives of many patients with MS. We believe that a critical component of unlocking T"SA%&I's true value is to develop tools to help patients assess their individual level of risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious brain infection. We made signi!cant progress on that front last year, initiating clinical studies in early 2010 to determine if a blood test to detect antibodies to JL virus, which causes PML, could help identify T"SA%&I patients at greater risk of developing the brain infection. At the end of January 2011, we had already enrolled more than 14,700 patients in our JLO assay trials. In December, along with our partner Elan Lorp., we !led with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency for approval to update T"SA%&I labeling to include anti-JLO antibody status as one potential risk factor for PML. In addition, %iogen Idec is in the enviable position of having 11 programs in or near latestage development. With such a robust late-stage pipeline, we are committed to launching several new products in the coming years. This is a great opportunity for us U but it is also a challenge that underscores the need for excellence in all that we do. Looking ahead to 2011, we expect to see read-outs of our DEFINE and LONFI&M trials for %G-12, our oral MS candidate with a promising safety and ef !cacy pro!le. We also expect a read-out in the second half of the year for one of our two registrational trials for daclizumab. We expect to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial for dexpramipexole in ALS in the !rst half of this year. We're also excited about the prospects of our other promising late-stage programs, including PEGylated interferon, which may reduce the frequency of interferon injections for MS, and our two hemophilia programs. These are diseases with high unmet needs where we believe our therapies may offer highly differentiated bene!ts for patients.
