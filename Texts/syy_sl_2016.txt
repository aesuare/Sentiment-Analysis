  Dear Sysco Shareholders,
We are pleased to report that Sysco delivered excellent financial results during fiscal 2016. This strong performance reflects the soundness of our strategy, a continued commitment to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improving execution of our three-year plan. The increasing momentum in our business is a result of strong local case growth, gross profit dollar growth with gross margin expansion and solid expense management. For the 53-week fiscal year ending July 2, 2016, we achieved, on a GAAP basis, sales of $50.4 billion, operating income of $1.9 billion and earnings per share of $1.64. On a 52-week adjusted basis*, we grew sales 1.5 percent, operating income 9.6 percent and earnings per share 12.0 percent to $2.06.
We are particularly encouraged by our progress toward achieving our long-term objectives, which focus on improving the customer experience, enhancing associate engagement and consistently achieving our financial objectives. This progress is supported by a foundation built over the past several years through a series of investments and impactful commercial, supply chain and administrative initiatives. We further strengthened that foundation this fiscal year with a number of key accomplishments, all of which will contribute to our success in FY17, including:
• Leveraged customer insights to create new and enhanced sales and marketing programs,
• Advanced our work in Category Management and Revenue Management,
• Enhanced our technology strategy to a more customer-centric
focus, and
• Restructured our business to drive greater efficiency.
We accomplished all of this by effectively executing our strategy, which is centered on five fundamental points:
• Partnership – Profoundly enrich the experience of doing business with Sysco
• Productivity – Continuously improve productivity in all areas of our business
• Products – Enhance offerings through a customer-centric innovation program
• People – Leverage talent, structure, and culture to drive performance • Portfolio – Continuously assess new market opportunities and
current business
Regarding the latter point, we recently closed the acquisition of the Brakes Group, a leading European foodservice distributor with significant presence in the United Kingdom, France and Sweden. Brakes is a highly regarded company whose management team and strategy are well-aligned with the vision we have for Sysco – to be our customers’ most valued and trusted business partner. In addition, this acquisition will serve as a platform for future expansion in Europe. We are fortunate to welcome Brakes into the Sysco family and look forward to working together to execute our business strategies.
As we move into the second quarter of our new fiscal year, we remain acutely focused on helping our customers succeed and creating value for our shareholders through disciplined volume growth, quality earnings growth and effectively implementing our key strategic initiatives. All of which are enabled by a strong customer-centric technology strategy, our diverse and highly engaged workforce and the importance we continue to place on corporate social responsibility.
Our past and future success is driven by the ongoing dedication and commitment of our associates, and we thank them for their strong participation in the delivery of a very successful fiscal year.
   “ This strong performance reflects the soundness of our strategy, a continued commitment to supporting the success of our customers and the consistently improvingexecutionofourthree-yearplan. ”
