The very word "momentum" connotes forward motion, a steady trajectory to your 637.2 destination. There's no more fitting word to describe the CHS journey

LEADERSHIP LETTER

_We've returned record economic value to our owners. In fiscal 2014, based on fiscal 2013 results, we distributed $637.2 million in cash patronage, equity redemptions and preferred stock dividends. That brings to $2.1 billion the cash and preferred stock returned over the past five years. And, as the fiscal year closed, we used preferred stock to retire $200 million in previously earned qualified equity to nearly 8,000 eligible member cooperatives, patrons associations and individuals. There's no question your company has achieved exceptional momentum. And we're prepared to sustain that momentum. Even as we invested in growth and made significant cash returns to our owners, we have built the strongest balance sheet in CHS history. Our goal is to prudently manage all the financial tools available to us, including member equity, debt and preferred stock, to keep CHS strong and growing within constantly changing global market dynamics. While investments in domestic and global assets are essential, we know driving momentum requires a comparable commitment to attracting, developing and retaining high-caliber people who can maximize CHS value and growth for you. We've made talent development a priority, including creating opportunities for CHS employees to grow through new assignments beyond their current businesses or geographies. We're also making tremendous investments behind the scenes with the companywide CHS United technology and business process initiative. Finally, we will take advantage of a high-test momentum booster: the collective value of the diverse CHS business enterprise. We'll continue to capitalize on untapped synergies, efficiencies and opportunities across more than a dozen CHS businesses, leveraging our unparalleled connections from the farmer to the global marketplace, to drive even more growth for you. DAVID BIELENBERG Chairman, Board of Directors CARL CASALE President and Chief Executive Officer Will CHS keep moving forward even as global economic clouds roll in to end one of the sunniest periods in agriculture history? We're confident the investments underway, opportunities we've identified and our financial strength will continue to build momentum that allows us to achieve our ultimate goal: helping you grow -- tomorrow and for years to come.
