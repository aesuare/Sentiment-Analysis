Letter to Shareholders
Fellow shareholders, Avery Dennison continued building momentum in 2015, posting results that were excellent by virtually every measure. We achieved strong organic sales growth as well as double-digit growth in earnings per share, remaining on track to meet our long-term targets. In market segments where we have long been successful, we captured new growth; in segments where we believe sales could be stronger, we adjusted our approach. We continued pursuing sustainability, meeting or surpassing all of our initial goals and starting work toward ambitious new ones. And throughout the year, we followed our disciplined capital allocation strategy which resulted in a substantial return of cash to shareholders. In short, the already strong Avery Dennison story continued to get better in 2015. It is my pleasure to share some of the highlights from our year.
Another year of above-average returns This year, we increased earnings per share by over 10 percent, increased sales on an organic basis by nearly 5 percent, and expanded our operating margin by more than a full percentage point. We paid $133 million in dividends and repurchased 3.9 million shares of our stock for $232 million. We achieved all of this despite currency translation headwinds. Our 2015 results are the product of our ongoing strategy, which calls for us to grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service; to expand margins by increasing productivity and leveraging scale; and to drive capital efficiency. We are executing our strategy in a competitive landscape where we have several strong advantages, including a global footprint, economies of scale, and a superior capacity for innovation. Our two primary businesses lead their industries and, in many market segments, we command above industry-average margins.

Achieving our 2015 goals In addition to being a strong year, 2015 marked an important milestone: the final year of the four-year financial targets we announced in 2012. I am pleased to report that we met all of those goals this year. In 2014, we announced a new set of more ambitious targets for 2018, raising the bar for organic sales growth, operating margin, and return on capital. This year we made good progress toward those goals, and we are on track to meet them. Growth and record margins in PSM Pressure-sensitive Materials (PSM) continues to lead worldwide, improving product mix and increasing growth through innovation and differentiation. In 2015, PSM delivered its fourth consecutive year of strong volume growth, while significantly improving its profitability and return on capital. Sales on an organic basis increased by about 5 percent, with growth in developed and emerging markets alike. PSM's growth, combined with our ongoing productivity improvements and a favorable raw materials environment, drove a record operating margin that exceeded our long-term target. Within PSM, we continued to benefit from growth in the higher-value market segments where we have placed a strategic focus, including labels for durable goods and other specialty applications, as well as graphics and performance tapes. We completed the recapitalization of our European footprint for Graphics Solutions, which we began in 2014, enabling it to compete more effectively. Already, those efforts are paying off. Our graphics product line continues to grow, with especially strong performance in our Avery Dennison Supreme WrappingTM Film for automobiles. Performance Tapes also delivered another year of above-average growth. In 2015, we invested in a new custom coating line in China, designed specifically to capture opportunities in the industrial side of the business, where demand for tapes used for electronics, automotive and general industrial applications continues to expand. Due to the loss of a large personal care program driven by a customer's technology change, our overall sales of performance tapes are expected to decline in 2016. Nonetheless, we continue to expect high single-digit growth in the industrial side of our business. This reflects the progress we have made executing our share gain strategy in this high-value market segment, where adhesive-based tape solutions are used to create thinner, lighter products that replace traditional, mechanical fastening systems. We drove much of PSM's growth with innovations that improve productivity, shelf appeal and sustainability for our customers. Our advances in 2015 included TrueCutTM adhesive for paper, which enables converters to work more quickly and efficiently; Aqua OpaqueTM technology, which enables winemakers to employ premium labels that stay beautiful even when wet;

and Bio-based PE Film, a filmic facestock made entirely from sugarcane ethanol that is a recyclable, less carbon-intensive alternative to petroleum-based films. Building a more competitive RBIS Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS), while still the leader in the growing industry for apparel labels, tags and tickets, has experienced volatile sales growth in recent years. We consistently perform well in market segments where customers value our innovation, design capabilities, and global reach. But in market segments where products are less differentiated, or where customers may not sufficiently value the premium features and capabilities we offer, we have lost market share. Since such segments make up roughly 60 percent of the apparel market, it is crucial that we serve them better. In 2015, we began transforming RBIS to do just that, by developing a simpler, faster and more competitive business model. For customers who prefer to use locally sourced raw materials instead of the global standard, we are localizing sourcing. To respond more quickly to customers who prioritize fast service, we have decentralized decision-making. And in segments where cost drives purchasing decisions, we are managing pricing to be more competitive. Our new approach is already delivering results. In the second half of 2015, RBIS made solid progress toward its 2018 goals, delivering both top-line growth and margin improvement. As we make these changes, we continue to leverage our industry leadership, unrivaled innovation capability, and core competencies in printing, weaving and data management. RBIS' leadership in radio-frequency identification (RFID) and external embellishments continues to catalyze growth, as do our ongoing investments in the business. We are targeting RFID, in particular, to have a compound annual growth rate through 2018 of between 15 and 20-plus percent. Sales of RFID products increased by more than 20 percent this year, and we expect that momentum to continue through 2016 as more retailers adopt this technology to improve experiences for both consumers and retail associates. We recently expanded RBIS' capabilities in Vietnam to capture opportunities associated with that country's burgeoning apparel- and footwear-manufacturing industry. We are also investing to support the rapid growth of our RFID and heat-transfer technologies. I am confident these investments, along with our transformation of RBIS' business model, will put us back on track toward accelerating growth and achieving our 2018 targets. Progress and promise for Vancive Vancive Medical Technologies, the smallest of our three segments, is now profitable and continues to show promise for creating long-term value. In 2015, we launched our BeneHoldTM line of antimicrobial dressings, which we believe will drive significant growth once sales begin

to gain traction in 2017. In coming months, we expect to accelerate growth in Vancive's core product lines while continuing to expand margins. Vancive remains an excellent opportunity to gain share in a fragmented space that offers above-average growth with attractive margins. Returning capital to shareholders Our capital allocation strategy is simple: We deploy capital wherever we can generate the highest return for shareholders, whether through capital expenditures in our businesses, increasing cash dividends, repurchasing stock, or pursuing acquisitions. In 2015, our profitability and capital efficiency delivered free cash flow of $329 million. We distributed $365 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. However, our highest priority has been to invest in our business in a way that accelerates profitable growth in high-value segments. We anticipate a large increase in capital spending in 2016, partly due to carryover from projects we began in 2015, but also in support of our growth strategy. In addition to the investments we are making in RBIS, we are investing to support the growth of Graphics Solutions and of our PSM manufacturing footprint--particularly in Asia, where we expect market demand to continue outpacing that in the developed markets. We are also investing in information technology upgrades to drive productivity in our PSM supply chain in North America. Going forward, we are committed to continuing our disciplined approach to returning excess cash to shareholders over the long term. Our solid free cash flow, combined with a strong balance sheet, gives us ample capacity to invest in our existing businesses while continuing to grow our dividend, repurchase shares, and pursue value-enhancing, bolt-on acquisitions. Striving to be a force for good Momentum is most meaningful when it lasts. In 2015, we continued working to ensure the long-term viability of our company by aligning it with the social and environmental imperatives of the 21st century and creating solutions that enable our customers and suppliers to do the same. After meeting or exceeding all of our initial sustainability goals, we began working toward new, more ambitious goals for 2025, including targets for reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions, increasing our use of responsibly produced paper, and improving the environmental impact of the films and chemicals we use. We joined World Wildlife Fund's Climate Savers program and signed the American Businesses Act on Climate Change pledge, voicing support for a strong outcome at the 21st summit of the U.N.'s Conference of the Parties in Paris and demonstrating our commitment to climate action. In our ongoing effort to maintain a workforce that mirrors the world we serve, we launched an initiative to increase the number of women who hold leadership positions in our company. Our commitment: 40 percent female representation at the manager level and above by

the end of 2018. We are already seeing steady progress toward that target. I encourage you to read more about our sustainability efforts in our latest biennial sustainability report, at averydennison.com/sustainability. Transition As announced, I will serve as CEO through April 30, 2016, and will remain on the Avery Dennison Board of Directors as Executive Chairman. Mitchell R. Butier, Avery Dennison's president and chief operating officer since 2014, will succeed me as CEO, and has been nominated for election to the board. Since joining Avery Dennison in 2000, Mitch has worked in various businesses and regions across the company and in roles of increasing responsibility. He has been a close partner of mine and has been at the center of our most successful business strategies; most recently, he was the driver behind our focus on the high-value market segments of our portfolio, while making the investments necessary to be competitive across all product segments. Just as important, Mitch is a champion of the values, integrity and high ethical standards that define Avery Dennison. I will hand off my CEO duties to Mitch with complete confidence in his ability to guide Avery Dennison toward an increasingly prosperous future. Looking ahead As this year's results attest, the strategy that has driven Avery Dennison's momentum in recent years is still working well. In the coming year, we intend to stay the course. PSM and RBIS, our industry-leading core businesses, are well-positioned for profitable growth. We expect our expanding margin to fuel further value creation as we continue improving productivity. Capital discipline will remain at the heart of our decision-making; we will continue to invest for valueenhancing growth, while continuing to pay a sustainable cash dividend and repurchasing our stock. We will also continue innovating and forging new partnerships in pursuit of our sustainability goals. In all, we expect Avery Dennison's future to look very much like its recent, successful past. The credit for our momentum goes to our team members worldwide, whose loyalty and ingenuity continue to be the indispensable engines that push us forward. I thank all of them for their hard work and contributions. I also thank you, our shareholders, for joining us on our journey, and for your continued belief and investment in Avery Dennison.
