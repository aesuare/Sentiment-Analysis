LETTER TO INVESTORS
Enterprise set new records for operating and financial performance again in 2010. We continued to benefit from increased demand for natural gas liquids ("NGLs") as feedstocks by the petrochemical and refining industries due to NGLs' global cost advantage relative to more expensive crude oil derivatives. We also completed construction of several growth capital projects that began generating new sources of cash flow. During the year, we acquired Enterprise GP Holdings L.P. and eliminated our general partner's incentive distribution rights, which reduced our long-term cost of equity capital.
Our record performance enabled us to achieve our goal of increasing Enterprise's cash distribution rate at the end of 2010 to an annualized $2.36 per unit while retaining approximately $480 million of distributable cash flow for 2010 to reinvest in the growth of the partnership. We also took steps throughout 2010 and early in January 2011 to strengthen our liquidity. As a result, our partnership began 2011 with a solid financial foundation and approximately $2.9 billion of consolidated liquidity. The partnership's large geographic footprint of assets continues to provide us with additional growth opportunities, such as the construction of infrastructure to serve producers in developing shale plays including the Haynesville and Eagle Ford. ANOTHER RECORD YEAR In 2010, our system of midstream energy assets transported a record 4.2 million barrels per day ("BPD") of NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals and 12.7 billion cubic feet per day ("Bcfd") of natural gas. The partnership increased its NGL and propylene fractionation volumes to a record 562,000 BPD; while our equity NGL production, the NGLs that Enterprise earns title to by providing natural gas processing services, increased to a record 121,000 BPD. These record volumes led to a significant increase in gross operating margin and distributable cash flow. Gross operating margin for 2010 increased by 13 percent to a record $3.3 billion.

We are investing approximately $2.7 billion to expand Enterprise's natural gas, NGL and crude oil system to serve Eagle Ford Shale producers in South Texas. These projects include over 300 miles $ 300 $300 of natural gas pipelines, a 600 million$cubic per day cryogenic 262 253 feet $ $250 natural gas processing plant, 127 miles of NGL pipelines and 140 miles of crude oil pipelines. $200 Some of these projects will begin operations during the second$150 half of 2011, with the remaining projects expected to be in service $100 throughout 2012. We believe the most important attribute of a successful midstream energy company is connecting $0 large, long-life producing areas 2008 2009 2010 of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate with the major markets for these hydrocarbons. Enterprise's integrated network of midstream energy assets is one of the best in the industry. We serve the largest producing regions in the contiguous 48 states, including some of the lowest-cost producing areas for NGL-rich natural gas. On the consuming end, we serve the Texas and Louisiana natural gas and NGL markets, which are the largest in the U.S. Our NGL pipelines access petrochemical production facilities that represent virtually all of U.S. ethylene production capacity and refineries that represent approximately 90 percent of the motor gasoline refining capacity east of the Rockies. We believe our system will continue to generate new growth opportunities. In closing, we would like to recognize our employees for their dedication and hard work in operating our assets and providing exceptional service to our customers. We would also like to thank our debt investors and equity partners for their continuing support.
