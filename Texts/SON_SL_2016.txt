growth around the world. Overall, we achieved record GAAP and base earnings, and gross profit margin expanded to the highest level in 15 years. We returned a record $253 million to shareholders in the form of sector-leading dividends and share repurchases, and we provided shareholders with an annual total return (including reinvested dividends) of 32.9%, compared with a 12% return by the S&P 500 and a 19% return by the Dow Jones Total Container and Packaging Index.
2016 Results
For 2016, net sales were $4.78 billion, down 3.7% from 2015. Sales declined in 2016 due to an estimated $83 million impact from foreign currency translation; the discontinuation of pack- aging center operations in Mexico; divestitures, net of acquisitions; and lower selling prices, primarily related to lower raw material costs.
GAAP net income attributable to Sonoco for 2016 was $286.4 million or $2.81 per diluted share,
up 14.5% from 2015. Current-year GAAP results included a net benefit of $.09 per diluted share, after tax, from a combination of the following: an overall net gain from the sale of the Company’s blowmolding operations; after-tax asset impairment and restructuring charges related to the sale of the Company’s paper mill in France and the sale of a retail packaging business in Puerto Rico; a goodwill impairment charge for

three years ago, we started a process to re-envision sonoco through our grow and optimize strategy. This strategy is focused on optimizing our portfolio to meaning- fully shift our business mix to more of a consumer and protective packaging orientation, which
we believe should deliver faster growth, more consistent earnings and improved returns, while continuing to allow us to return long-term value to shareholders. A key component is also creating a purpose-driven innovation environ- ment which engages and empowers our team- mates. By tapping into their expertise, and building a culture based on curiosity and collaboration, we will be better positioned to

company,
our purpose,
or our Why, is Better Packaging. Better Life.
You will find this statement in the center of our Grow and Optimize strategy, illustrated on the inside cover of this report. We believe this statement captures the essence of why Sonoco
has been successful in the past and why this success should continue into the future.
The creation of better packaging provides value to our direct customers and helps differentiate us from our competition. At the same time, through our products and innovations we contribute to a better life for consumers, whether by protecting valuable life-saving vaccines, improving the safety or fuel economy of vehicles, or making food products safer, longer-lasting, fresher or just easier to access, open and store.
our purpose is directly connected to our
guiding principle, which is to “Be a great company for
our stakeholders through an unwavering belief People Build
Businesses by doing the right thing.”
but what is “the right thing”? Within Sonoco, our 20,000 associates innately know what it is, but to be clear the right thing is a collection of our Values, Promises and Principles.
our values—integrity, respect,
service, teamwork and accountability— have been articulated throughout our 117-year history. These are the characteristics we want every Sonoco associate to display each and every day.
our promises are our commitments to our various stakeholders, including our shareholders.
finally, our principles are statements that express our beliefs about how we work.
collectively, these values, promises and principles define the right thing, and are the essence of Sonoco’s DNA. They create a frame for our decision-making, and we should never make a decision that takes us outside of
this frame.

Base earnings for 2016 were $277.2 million or $2.72 per diluted share, up 8.0% from 2015. This improvement stemmed from a positive price/cost relationship, productivity improvements, lower pension expense, and acquisitions, net of divestitures. Partially offsetting these positive factors were higher labor, maintenance and
other operating costs and a negative impact of foreign currency translation. Volume/mix was essentially flat for 2016 as volume growth in Protective Solutions was mostly offset by volume declines in Consumer Packaging.
Gross profit increased to a record $937.4 million in 2016, up approximately 1%, largely due to a positive price/cost relationship and manufacturing productivity improvements. Gross profit as a percent of sales was 19.6 percent, up 90 basis points from 2015.

debt-to-total-capital ratio of 40.4% at the end of 2016, compared with 42.4% at end of 2015. Cash and cash equivalents were $257.2 million at year end, compared with $182.4 million at the end of 2015. The higher cash balance at the end of 2016 reflects the net proceeds from the sale of the blow-molding business less cash spent on acquisitions.
Grow and Optimize
Our Grow and Optimize strategy continues to drive performance improvement, as each of our four business segments reported year over year improvement in operating profit, with our targeted growth businesses—Consumer Packaging and Protective Solutions—reporting record results.
Operating profit in the Consumer Packaging segment grew 4% in 2016, and operating margin grew 90 basis points to a record 11.8%. Within
the segment, results from Rigid Paper Containers declined slightly, as volume growth of composite cans in the emerging markets partially offset declines in North America and Europe. Flexible packaging results solidly improved, and the acqui- sition of PPI should provide us a catalyst for con- tinued growth. Plastics packaging results were essentially flat, despite the divestiture of our blow- molding operations in early November. Finally,
Display and Packaging segment results rebounded in 2016 as we resolved
2015 issues with a contract pack- aging center in Mexico, which

 Despite higher net income, cash flow from opera- tions for 2016 was $398.7 million, compared to $452.9 million in 2015. The decline of $54.2 mil- lion was due primarily to $64.4 million in tax payments and fees related to the sale of the Company’s blowmolding plastics operations.
In addition, current-year pension and post-retire- ment plan contributions, net of expenses, were $22.7 million higher than in 2015. Net capital expenditures and cash dividends were $186.6 mil- lion and $146.4 million, respectively, during 2016.
The lower cash flow from operations in 2016, together with higher net capital expenditures and cash dividends paid, resulted in free cash flow declining to $65.7 million in 2016. The Company completed four acquisitions in 2016 for approx- imately $89 million in cash, including Plastic Packaging Inc., a privately held Hickory, N.C.- based flexible packaging company for $67.6 million; and Laminar Medica, a privately held specialty medical temperature-assured products company based in the United Kingdom.
 The Company also spent $100.0 million in 2016 to repur- chase approximately 2.03 million shares of common stock at an average cost
of $49.25 per share.
At year end, total debt was approximately $1.05 billion, compared with $1.13 billion at the end of 2015. The Company had a total-

w We have strengthened our position in rigid
paper containers globally through acquisitions 7 and growth in emerging markets.
w We have shed some non-core assets and made acquisitions in our key growth areas—Consumer Packaging and Protective Solutions.
w We have reduced debt and strengthened our balance sheet to prepare us for growth.
Finally, we have implemented all these changes while returning approximately $890 million in cash to shareholders over the past five years. In 2016, we raised common stock dividends 6% to an annualized rate of $1.48 per share, marking the 34th consecutive year we have raised dividends, while providing consecutive quarterly dividends dating back to 1925.
We expect 2017 to be a transitional year for Sonoco as we are not forecasting any significant pickup in consumer demand, while we continue to rebalance and realign our portfolio. In addition, we are focused on accelerating growth, both organically and through acquisitions, recovering raw material inflation, and reducing our unit cost to produce by improving manufacturing productivity.
We remain optimistic about the future, and firmly believe our Grow and Optimize strategy is a winning formula to drive growth, deliver more consistent earnings, improve returns and create greater value for our shareholders. We thank you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your investment.

Our Protective Solutions segment was a real bright spot in 2016 as operating profit grew 12%, and operating margin for the year grew 70 basis points to 9.8%. The Laminar acquisition, along with the addition of a small refrigerated cargo container operation, complements our strong position in the growing global temperature- assured packaging market.
2017 Outlook
As we look forward into 2017, it is important to put into context the changes we have put in place over the past three years to drive our long-term success.
w We have improved the baseline performance
of our key businesses, as illustrated by profit margins having improved to the highest levels in more than a decade, while Returns on Net Assets Employed (RONAE) have grown from 7.6% in 2012 to 11.1% in 2016.
