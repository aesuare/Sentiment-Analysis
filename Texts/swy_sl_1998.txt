 To Our Stockholders
199 8 was a nothe r year of soli d pro g r ess f or
S a f e w a y. We imp roved o ur ope ratin g re s u l t s , strengthened our financial position, steppedup our capital spending program, and completed one acquisition and initiated another.
Improved Operating Results
Net income was $ 806.7 m illio n ($1. 59 per share ) in the 52 weeks of 1998 compared to $621.5 mil- lion ($1.25 per share) of income before extraordi- nary loss in 1997, a 53-week year. Results in 1997 were adversely affected by an extraordinary loss of $6 4.1 m i lli on ( $0 .1 3 p er sha re) , a ris ing fr o m the replacement of higher interest rate debt with lower-rate debt.
Total sales increased to $24.5 billion, up 8.9% from 1997. Sales of identical stores (which exclude replace- ments) rose 3.7%, while compara- ble-store sales increased 4.1%. Through year- end 1998, we had recorded six con- secutive years of positive sales
growth in both identical and comparable stores. Gross profit increased 57 basis points to
29.10% in 1998, reflecting continuing improve-
ment in buying practices and product mix while maintaining competitive prices.
Operating and administrative (O&A) expense as a percentage of sales fell 28 basis points to 22.56%, largely as a result of increased sales an d o ngo in g e ff o r ts to re duc e o r c ont rol co sts . Our O&A expense ratio has declined for six stra ight years.
Operating cash flow increased to 8.75% of sales, the highest level on an annual basis in our 72-year history. While we have improved our cash flow margin by 368 basis points since the end of 1992, when we began our turnaround, we believe we can make further progress.
Stronger Financial Position
Interest expense declined slightly to $235.0 mil- lion in 1998. Our interest coverage ratio (operat- ing cash flow divided by interest expense) improved to 9.11 times in 1998 from 7.18 times in 1997 due to strong operating results.
During 1998 we also reduced the average interest rate on debt through a series of refinanc- ings, had the investment grade ratings on our senior unsecured debt reaffirmed by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, and maintained negative working capital for the fifth consecutive year.
Standard & Poor’s added Safeway common stock to its S&P 500 Index in November 1998.
Accelerated Capital Spending
Capital investments increased to $1.2 billion in 1998, up from $829 million the prior year. We opened 46 new stores, remodeled 234 existing
 
 stores and completed construction of a new distri- bution center in Maryland. During 1999 we plan to invest approximately $1.2 billion and open 55 to 60 new stores while completing some 250
rem o dels . As in the rec ent pa st, ab out thr e e - quarters of our capital expenditures in the com- ing year is budgeted for new stores and remodels.
Continued Growth Through Acquisitions
While improving our store system in existing markets will remain the central focus of our capi- tal expenditure program, our long-term growth strategy remains focused on acquisitions.
In November 1998 we acquired Dominick’s Supermarkets, Inc., the second largest super- market operator in the Chicago metropolitan area with 114 stores and sales of $2.4 billion in fiscal 1998. As with the Vons merger in 1997, the combination with Dominick’s enables us to extend our geographic reach and to benefit from the exchange of best practices. Dominick’s has an excellent reputation in the Chicago market and operates attractive stores in good locations. We are confident we can build on that success.
The pending acquisition of Carr-Gottstein Foods Co., Alaska’s leading food and drug retail- er, is expected to result in considerable synergies for our own Alaskan operations. In support of its 49 stores, Carrs operates the state’s largest food warehouse and freight network.
The U.S. supermarket industry, historically highly fragmented, is becoming increasingly con- solidated. Whereas the top five chains had a com- bined market share of only 19% in 1992, their
share had risen to 24% in 1997, should expand to 36% this year as a result of pending mergers and, we b eliev e, is l ikely to increase further. Growth through acquisition will continue to be a key part of our strategy.
Review and Outlook
During the past six years, our total market capi- talization has increased to approximately $29.9 billion from just $1.3 billion in 1992. No other publicly traded supermarket chain has achieved even half that growth rate over the same period.
Many of you have participated in this growth. As illustrated on the facing page, $1,000 invested in Safeway stock at the beginning of 1993 had increased in value to $18,750 by year-end 1998.
We a re pro ud of our ac hie ve men ts. T h e y reflect the dedication and hard work of 170,000 Safeway employees, many of whom are stock- holders themselves. On their behalf, let me assure you that all of us on the Safeway team are committed to building on our past success and making continued progress in 1999 and beyond.
