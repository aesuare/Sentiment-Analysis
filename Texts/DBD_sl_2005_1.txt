Dear Fellow Shareholders: At Diebold, getting down to business means focusing on the basics: renewing our commitment to customer service and satisfaction; improving our global operations and infrastructure; and more effectively leveraging our companyÕs resour ces and talent. It also means focusing on our future: building a stronger foundation that enables us to better prepare for and capture the potential that lies ahead for our company.

Since being appointed president and chief executive officer in December 2005, I have met with many of our employees around the world. And I have heard from literally thousands of them in dozens of countries via e-mail. Their passion, sense of purpose and resolve to improve our business is strong. By getting down to business, we are addressing the challenges that affected our performance in 2005. This performance was clearly below our expectations, and we need to do a better job forecasting customer demand, managing our supply chain, controlling manufacturing and product costs and streamlining our quality assurance processes. While the challenges we faced in 2005 were significant, so too are the strengths we enjoy and the opportunities that lie ahead. The markets we serve are dynamic and continue to grow. Financial institutions continue to place increasing strategic importance on their retail networks. Demand is increasing for integrated security solutions. Our brand is trusted by our customers and we have strong relationships on which to build. We have world-class products and services that offer us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. And we have a growing global footprint with a broad customer base. From a financial perspective we are strong, with a solid balance sheet and significant cash flow. Our financial strength is reflected in the 10.8 percent increase in our 2005 dividend ­ the 52nd consecutive annual increase ­ and in the share repurchase program our board approved in December 2005. But the one key feature of our company that is most important to us ­ and that underscores the confidence and optimism with which we face the future ­ is the commitment, energy and knowledge of our employees. Focusing on the Customer What we need to do ­ and what we are currently doing ­ is simple and straightforward. We are adopting a laser-like focus on the customer. We are instilling the value of increased customer satisfaction and loyalty into the foundation of our culture. We know we'll always be striving to achieve our goal ­ and that's precisely the point. Customers' needs and expectations always change. Things that add value for our customers tomorrow will be different from what they are today and were yesterday. Customers constantly adapt to the dynamics of their markets. Therefore we must constantly adapt to the dynamics of our markets as well. To build a strong culture focused on the customer, we've identified key areas of focus: improving quality and strengthening our supply chain; enhancing communications and teamwork; and rebuilding profitability. With the introduction of Opteva® and Agilis®, we have developed a truly global product platform in our financial self-service business. The results of this effort are clear: there is strong demand in the marketplace for our offerings. But our ability to plan, source, build, test and

ship our products has not kept pace. So we're adapting a unified global supply chain management process that is more responsive and efficient, and that eliminates waste. We're improving and streamlining how we test and validate our offerings before they reach the customer. And we're more effectively leveraging our global manufacturing capability to enhance productivity and reduce costs. Diebold is a global company with more than 14,000 employees around the world. We are opening up lines of communication across job functions and geographies to share our knowledge and best practices. We are coordinating our efforts and collaborating on key initiatives. Enhancing communications and teamwork ­ up, down and across our company ­ is essential as we move forward. In short, we've developed and are implementing an integrated approach to improving our operational infrastructure and processes. We've formed shared goals and priorities aligned with the needs of our markets. We're instilling more discipline throughout the organization. All of which will lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, and improved performance. A Leader in Financial Self-service As I mentioned, we believe the financial self-service business continues to offer significant potential for Diebold. While the factors stimulating demand can vary by region and country, there are important common elements underlying our opportunities in this business. First, financial institutions are investing in their retail and self-service networks for strategic, competitive and performance reasons. And second, our offerings are differentiated in terms of their feature functionality, lower cost of ownership and our superior service capabilities.
Since being appointed president and CEO in December 2005, I have met with many of our employees around the world. Their passion, sense of purpose and resolve to improve our business is strong. Pictured above from my travels in Brazil, India and Europe are from top to bottom: João Abud, president, Diebold Procomp; James Chen, vice president and managing direc tor, Asia Pacific, with leaders in India; and Henrik Funch, vice president and managing director, Europe, Middle East and Africa.

In the larger, more mature banking markets, including the United States and Western Europe, we're capitalizing on upgrade and replacement opportunities, as well as the trend toward deposit automation, including check-imaging and envelope-free currency acceptance solutions. In faster-growing, emerging markets, such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, financial institutions are expanding their networks as they strive to better capture, serve and compete for customers and to improve their efficiency and productivity. A case in point: Bank of China, widely regarded as one of the country's most successful banks, and the second largest state-run commercial bank in China, has announced plans to transfer about 40 percent of its traditional teller transactions to its self-service delivery channel by 2008. We are proud that the bank selected us as one of its major ATM suppliers, purchasing more than 600 Opteva ATMs and nearly 300 bulk cash recycle machines, as well as our Agilis software and related services. The breadth and depth of our service offerings, which comprise more than 50 percent of our financial self-service revenue, continue to provide a competitive advantage for Diebold. Going forward, we're focused on capitalizing on the trend toward integrated services, in which customers entrust us with the monitoring, maintenance, operation, and in some cases ownership, of their self-service networks.

Security Solutions: Strong Market Dynamics Through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions, our Security Solutions business now generates more than $660 million a year in revenue. We continue to believe the market for our integrated security offerings is both global and growing, and we're taking action to capture this potential. Our strategy involves globalizing the expertise and capabilities we currently have in selected markets in order to fully leverage our brand, infrastructure and footprint. This includes capitalizing on our strong presence in financial self-service outside of the United States to increase our security offerings to our financial customers. It also includes further penetrating promising new markets, such as government, retail and commercial sectors. Over the past two years we have made a number of strategic acquisitions in support of our commitment to enhance and grow our security business. These acquisitions have strengthened our global presence and provided expertise in digital security and enterprise level security systems integration. Today's successful security providers will be defined by their ability to blend traditional security knowledge and business practice with emerging technology. And, with our history in the security business and extended services capability, we are a thought leader in this industry. Election Systems: Unparalleled Accuracy and Reliability With more than 100,000 installed touch-screen and optical scan units in the United States, our Election Systems business has grown relatively quickly. This reflects the fact that electronic voting offers unparalleled accuracy and reliability, and improves accessibility. Our focus here is on introducing new products that respond to emerging market needs and developing services to help automate and simplify the election process, while building recurring revenue streams. Focused on Our Future As I mentioned at the outset, getting down to business means focusing on improving what we do today and preparing to capture new opportunities tomorrow. While we have a lot of work to do, we have many, many strengths ­ strengths that we can build on in 2006 and beyond. In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to our employees around the world. I deeply appreciate their hard work, passion and commitment. Together, we will continue to take this great company forward and work to realize our promise and potential. Sincerely,

Thomas W. Swidarski President and Chief Executive Officer
