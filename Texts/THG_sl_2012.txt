­ Responding to challenges, strengthening our financial foundation ­ Improving our business mix and spread of risk, positioning us to deliver strong underwriting performance ­ Enhancing our distinctive market position with our agents and broker partners

We have built a strong franchise and we are focused on continuing to make progress toward our goals.

RESPONDING TO CHALLENGES, STRENGTHENING OUR FINANCIAL FOUNDATION
During 2012, our company and our industry were tested once again by a series of natural disasters in the United States, a sluggish economy, and a prolonged low interest rate environment -- all of which combined to constrain earnings. We responded well to these challenges, serving our agent partners and their customers, and improving our overall financial condition.

Superstorm Sandy alone had a significant impact on earnings for our company, and for many others. The storm, which struck the Northeast in October, is expected to be the second most costly natural catastrophe event ever for us and for the industry.

Even with more than twice the average level of catastrophe losses we expect in a given year, we generated net income of $56 million, compared to $37 million in 2011.

In the wake of this devastating storm, our claims team rose to the occasion, helping our agent partners and their clients during their time of need. We received excellent feedback on our response, further enhancing our reputation and our brand.

With our disciplined underwriting approach and well-balanced business mix, we continued to generate strong results during the year in spite of the challenges. On an ex-catastrophe basis, we generated a combined ratio of 95.7 percent, compared to an estimated 98 percent for the industry. We improved our accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, by 1.5 points.

In addition, we maintained a strong balance sheet, reflecting the conservative approach we take to our investment activities, strong reserves, and effective capital management strategies.

The prolonged low interest rate environment in 2012 continued to pressure investment yields and income from our fixed income portfolio. Yet, our net investment income increased 7 percent, with the addition of assets from Chaucer, strong portfolio resiliency, and our ability to find attractive investment opportunities without lowering the quality of assets in our portfolio.

2012 Annual Report | The Hanover Insurance Group

Our total capital stood at $3.4 billion at the end of the year. We returned capital to shareholders and lowered our debt leverage, while actively and opportunistically managing our capital to optimize its structure and efficiency.

We increased shareholders' equity to $2.6 billion during the year, after dividend payments of $55 million and share repurchases of $20 million, and we achieved our highest-ever, year-end book value per share at $58.59.

IMPROVING OUR BUSINESS MIX AND SPREAD OF RISK
The remarkable growth and transformation of our geographic and product spread continued in 2012. As we exceeded the $5 billion mark for annual written premiums, up from $3 billion only several years ago, we also made important headway toward managing our portfolio to a mix capable of delivering sustainable, top-quartile underwriting results.

First, we continued to adjust our business mix in both commercial and personal lines, reducing volatility and property concentrations in certain geographic markets through proactive agency management, pricing strategies, and coverage modifications. As a result of these initiatives, our mix now is well balanced, geographically and by product, with a growing proportion of casualty, which we expect will deliver higher margins.

We sustained our efforts to broaden our geographic footprint, and we now write more than $300 million of commercial lines business in our West Region. In fact, the effectiveness of our diversification and property management efforts was demonstrated in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. While Sandy was a direct hit on some of the areas where we have our highest market penetration, our losses from this event were substantially lower than our market share would have predicted.

Second, we achieved strong rate increases throughout the year in both commercial and personal lines. More importantly, in this very dynamic market environment, we continued to approach price increases in a thoughtful and targeted manner, minimizing disruption and improving the quality of our book. As a result, we finished the year with overall pricing increases of 9 percent in commercial lines and 8 percent in personal lines. We achieved these increases without a decline in our customer base. Retention remained strong in both lines, which gives us confidence we will be able to continue to increase pricing in 2013.

Third, we continued to expand our specialty business, and positioned it to achieve better profitability across all lines. This business continued to grow last year, generating more than $800 million in annual direct written premium. Most of that is established business that we expect will contribute to the bottom line. We also made a number of infrastructure and process changes that we expect to drive better profitability in this business going forward.

Finally, our expansion into international markets through Chaucer already has begun to provide the earnings resiliency and diversification we expected. While we experienced elevated catastrophe losses in our U.S. business during 2012, we benefited from a strong performance in our international business, with a limited number of weather events and large losses. For the year, Chaucer generated very strong earnings and a combined ratio of 90 percent.

ENHANCING OUR DISTINCTIVE MARKET POSITION
As we continue our journey, we are better positioned to succeed than at any time in our 160-year history.

"

[The Hanover] is making strategic partnerships stronger by giving us the resources... What agents are looking for are relationships where companies not only hold agents accountable, but where companies are held accountable, including strategic investments."

We have established strong growth momentum with many of the best agents and brokers in the country, as our value proposition has resonated among this elite group. Our distribution strategy is unique because we market our products and services through a limited number of independent agents and brokers who are committed to investing in their businesses and growing with us.

Mike Ansay, CEO, Ansay and Associates

" "

Not everybody gets to represent The Hanover. That's an advantage for us."

Timm Marini, President, FieldEddy Insurance

We limit access to our most innovative and specialized products to these partners, offering meaningful franchise value to them. In turn, our partners write more business with us at appropriate margins, targeting the mix we desire.

The agents who have specialization are typically able to grow those revenue streams faster...Carriers can be a real asset and help their [agents'] ability to be effective and set themselves apart."

Bobby Reagan, CEO, Reagan Consulting

We also put experienced professionals in the field to work

And, in Chaucer, we have a portfolio of international specialty businesses with distinctive positions in the Lloyd's market. Some of Chaucer's capabilities are relevant and attractive to our agent and broker partners in the U.S., and we will further develop an infrastructure and capability to provide selected agents with the direct access to specialized knowledge and underwriting expertise they seek.

CREATING VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERS
As we begin 2013, we are well positioned to improve our performance and deliver on our long-term goals. We have set a strong financial foundation for our company, assembled one of the best teams in our industry, developed a product portfolio that is relevant to our best partners, and established an operating model that represents a significant competitive advantage. We will continue to capitalize on the improving pricing environment in all lines, and we expect to benefit from the mix changes we made in 2012.

The goal for our journey remains the same: to deliver top-quartile financial performance throughout the cycle. While the challenges in our business will persist, we have every confidence we will deliver on our promise, and that we will create significant value for our shareholders and for all of our stakeholders.

Sincerely,

Frederick H. Eppinger President and Chief Executive Officer
