To Our Shareholders and Employees:
We are very pleased to present our 2005 Annual Report and file our 2005 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Flowserve's mission is to move, control and protect the flow of materials in some of the world's most critical industries (such as oil and gas, chemical, power and water). We put that commitment in motion everyday in 2005. From providing support to our customers and employees who were affected by Hurricanes Rita and Katrina, to the day-to-day delivery of our products, services and solutions, Flowserve employees have remained focused on demonstrating our core values and providing exceptional service at every possible opportunity. Our more than 13,000 employees realize that our commitment and partnership to our customers is what sets us apart from our competitors and allows us to focus on continued organic growth and delivering a world-class, consistent, Flowserve experience. Our vision is to distinguish ourselves to our customers by delivering flow management products and solutions as a global, unified, customer-centric business. In 2005, we continued to support this vision by focusing on our six key strategies: We delivered organic growth in bookings of more than 13%, excluding currency, with new products and services and expansion into emerging geographies that will create future aftermarket revenue opportunities. Our active expansion efforts in China, India, Russia and the Middle East have been critical to our success. We continue to drive a unified organizational presence under the Flowserve brand name as a means to be seen as a broader business partner by our customers. We strengthened our core business through strategic portfolio management of our products and services. The divestiture of the General Services Group and smaller bolt-on acquisitions were in-line with our focus on improving our current platform and maintaining our strategic initiatives. We infused innovative technology into our products and services in order to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and help maximize our customers' ability to expand revenues and margins. Our Intelligent Pump Series (IPS), IPS Tempo, was recently showcased and is an example of our cross-divisional technology focus. We increased the globalization of our business in emerging geographies as a means to improve our competitiveness and help secure the future of our company. The increased globalization also includes our focus on low-cost sourcing and investments in India, Mexico, Eastern Europe and China as well as increasing our global diversity. This builds upon our expansive global platform already in place to support our worldwide customer base. Process excellence was driven by our Continuous Improvement Process and incentive programs designed to deliver maximum productivity and customer fulfillment. Improvements in on-time delivery, lower material costs and reduced time-to-market are key goals. We also began an initiative to migrate our older information technology systems to a standard, more efficient platform. This will prepare the company for a less complex operating environment to enable additional productivity and process improvement. We are also building an organizational capability that centers on ethics, learning, leadership and an empowered culture focused on delivering consistent performance and results. These six strategic initiatives continue to be the foundation for our current and future plans for success.
CORE MARKETS

Since our last annual report, we have seen continued strength in our core markets, especially the oil and gas, power and chemical sectors. The oil and gas markets specifically have seen a significant increase in capital expenditures for exploration and production driven by higher oil prices and increased demand. This coupled with the urbanization of emerging market countries is driving a continued demand for Flowserve products and services. This market strength, combined with our portfolio of leading products, global manufacturing footprint and dedicated employees continue to provide increased opportunities for profitable growth.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

The following are some key financial highlights of 2005:  Booked record orders of $3 billion representing 13% growth, excluding currency, compared with 2004  Improved consolidated gross margin percentage to 32% from 30% in 2004, reflecting successful operational excellence initiatives  Completed $1 billion debt refinancing resulting in a more flexible capital structure and savings of more than $20 million in interest expense

 Increased net earnings from continuing operations to $0.82 per diluted share from $0.46 in 2004  Generated strong cash flow, which was used to repay $78 million of debt and other financing obligations, and for other strategic purposes  Divested the General Services Group as part of our ongoing portfolio management  Supported the successful February 2006 completion of our 2000 through first quarter 2004 financial restatement and the filing of the 2004 Form 10-K with the SEC We are very pleased to report that full year 2005 bookings increased 13%, excluding currency, to a record $3.02 billion compared with $2.66 billion in the prior year. Year-end 2005 backlog stood at a record $994.1 million compared with $836.4 million at the end of the prior year reflecting, in part, the strength of customer investments being made in the oil and gas and power businesses. Sales increased 7% to $2.70 billion in 2005 compared with $2.52 billion in 2004. In association with the strong bookings and sales growth, Flowserve has also experienced margin expansion in all segments. Gross profit from continuing operations in 2005 increased 14% to $861.8 million, compared with $758.6 million in 2004. These increases primarily reflect cost savings resulting from the company's ongoing continuous improvement initiatives, improved pricing discipline and increased sales, which favorably impacted the absorption of fixed costs. Operating income increased to $190.1 million from $161.5 million driven by gross margin contribution and fixed cost leverage, which was partially offset by higher SG&A expenses resulting from an increase in compliance costs, professional fees and management transition expenses. This higher level of unusual expenses has offset some of the efficiency improvements and productivity gains we have been making in our operations. In response, we have strengthened the global finance organization with people, training and improved controls to support our operations worldwide.

LOOKING AHEAD

In the near term, the company continues to focus on becoming fully current on our SEC filings by the end of the third quarter. The leading indicators in all of our markets continue to signal growth opportunities in 2006 and beyond. As previously announced, we began the first quarter of 2006 with a 34% year-over-year quarterly increase in organic bookings. This represented a record number of orders for the company. Our outlook continues to be strong. We believe that the combination of positive internal and external factors impacting Flowserve, as well as a dedicated workforce, operational excellence initiatives, a leading portfolio of products and solutions and our organizational capability provide us the strength and competitiveness to continue to expand our leading position in our industry.
