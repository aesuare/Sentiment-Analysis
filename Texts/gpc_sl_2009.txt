TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
2009 turned out to be one of the most challenging years in the history of Genuine Parts Company. The effects of the economic slowdown, which we began to experience in the final quarter of 2008, adversely impacted the results in all four of the business segments throughout 2009. However, we did see some early
signs of improving market conditions in the latter part of the year, and we feel that this bodes well for a stronger performance in 2010.
For 2009, total Company sales were $10.1 billion, a decrease of
9% compared to 2008. Net earnings for the year were $400 million, which is a 16% decrease compared to 2008 and earnings per share were $2.50 compared to $2.92, a decrease of 14%. As these results indicate, 2009 was a difficult year for GPC, but we continue to have confidence in the long-term positive fundamentals for all four of our businesses, and we feel that we are positioned to show improved sales and earnings results as the economy begins to turn.
  FINANCIAL STRENGTH
We were pleased to maintain a strong balance sheet throughout 2009, and your Company remains in excellent financial condition. Impactful asset management and working capital initiatives enabled us to generate record cash flows. Cash from operations totaled $845 million and, after dividends paid of $254 million, capital expenditures
of $69 million and the purchase of properties under a construction and lease agreement of $73 million, our free cash flow was approximately $449 million. At December 31, 2009, our total debt was $500 million, which was unchanged from the prior year and represents a modest 16% of total capitalization.
During the year we made six strategic bolt-on type acquisitions, ranging from $10 million to $55 million in annual revenues and these will add to our Automotive and Industrial growth rates in 2010. Additionally, in December we announced the pending acquisition of a $170 million company that will enable us to expand our Industrial operations in Western Canada and the northwestern region of the US. Acquisitions remain an integral part of our growth strategy, and we anticipate additional acquisition opportunities in the year ahead.
We also repurchased approximately 722,000 shares of our Company stock and continue to view this as a good use of our cash. As of December 31, 2009, we were authorized to repurchase up to 17.8 million shares, and we expect
to continue making opportunistic share repurchases during 2010.
OPERATIONS
As mentioned earlier, each of our four business segments was impacted by the difficult economy in 2009. The Automotive Group, our largest segment, reported a 2% sales decrease for the year. The first half of the year proved to be the most challenging, with 7% and 5% decreases in the first and second quarters, respectively. We were down
1% in the third quarter and then up 6% in the final quarter. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in our Automotive business over the course of the year, and we are optimistic about our growth opportunities in 2010.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group, reported a
5% decrease in sales for the year. This is a result of the industry-wide slowdown in office products consumption, which began in 2007. Like Automotive, however, we experienced an improving sequential trend in revenues
in 2009, with sales down 7%, 6%, 5% and 4% in the first, second, third and fourth quarters, respectively. Our sales strategy remains intensely focused on capturing additional market share, which we feel is necessary for sales growth in this segment in the near term. Longer term, the combination of several key sales initiatives, along with
the eventual increase in office employment, will further enhance our revenue growth.
The difficult economic conditions of the last 15 months or so most significantly impacted our two business segments serving the manufacturing sector of the economy. Motion Industries, our industrial distribution company, reported an 18% sales decrease for the year, and EIS, our Electrical/ Electronic segment, reported a 26% decrease in 2009. These declines follow several years of solid sales growth for Motion and EIS, and they reflect the extreme downturn in industrial demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of 2008. We did see, however, a slight strengthening in several key industrial indicators over
the last half of 2009 and, if sustainable, we anticipate an increase in demand for our industrial related businesses as we progress through 2010.
MANAGEMENT
During 2009, there were a number of management changes and promotions that we would like to share with you. First, we are pleased to tell you that Michael D. Orr was promoted to the GPC Headquarters staff in August 2009 and at our

In July 2009, Paul D. Donahue was named President of
the U.S. Automotive Parts Group. Previously, Paul was responsible for several of the Company’s automotive business units, a role he assumed upon election to the position of Executive Vice President of the Company in 2007. Before that assignment, Paul was President and Chief Operating Officer of S.P. Richards Company. Paul is providing strong leadership to our largest business unit. Additionally, Lee A. Maher was named Executive Vice President of the U.S. Automotive Parts Group, effective December 2009. Lee started with the Company in 1977 and has held a variety of important automotive positions over the years, including his most recent role as the U.S. APG Midwest Division Vice President.

At Motion Industries, Thomas L. Miller, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, retired from the Company in June 2009. Tom joined the Company in 1974 and has since served Motion across the country and in a variety of important management roles. We appreciate Tom’s dedication and leadership and wish him the very best in his retirement. M. Wayne Law has assumed the
position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Wayne started with the Company in 1968 and has successfully held several key roles at the Company, including his most recent position as Executive Vice President, Corporate Purchasing and Distribution.
In another key promotion, Richard T. Toppin was named President and Chief Operating Officer of S.P. Richards Company, effective January 2010. Rick joined S.P. Richards as Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing in
2008 after an impressive career in sales, marketing and executive roles in the print and office supplies industries. Rick quickly proved himself to be a great addition to our Office Products Group, and we are pleased to have him take on an even greater role there.
CONCLUSION
Despite the challenges of 2009, management continues to have confidence in the long-term fundamentals for each of our business segments. We are fortunate to operate in four good industries. Turning to 2010, our primary areas of focus are consistent across all four of our businesses: producing positive sales results, improving operating margins, generating solid cash flows and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We look forward to reporting our progress in each of these areas on a quarterly basis in 2010.
We want to express our appreciation to our employees, customers, vendors and shareholders for your commitment to and ongoing support of Genuine Parts Company.
