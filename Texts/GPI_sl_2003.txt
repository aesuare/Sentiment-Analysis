Dear Stockholders:

We continue to prudently manage our capital structure.

I

am pleased to report that 2003 was another successful year for Group 1 Automotive. Faced with yet a third straight year of a challenging economic environment, we delivered a sixth consecutive year of earnings-per-share growth-- a record that most companies would be hard-pressed to match in any economy. We achieved this by staying true to our business model, demonstrating once again our strength as a specialty retailer. 2003 Report Card In last year's letter, I told you that 2003 would be a year of growth for your company, and solid, steady growth is exactly what we delivered. Consolidated revenues

charged against the reserve. Also in 2003, we sold more than 162,000 retail vehicles and serviced 1.2 million vehicles--both Group 1 records. Income from operations rose 7.1 percent to $147.3 million, and our operating margin remained stable at 3.3 percent. Net income grew 13.4 percent, from $67.1 million in 2002, to $76.1 million for the current year. We reported diluted earnings per share up 16.4 percent to $3.26, including a $0.21 per share positive impact to income tax expense resulting from favorably resolving tax contingencies. Since 1999, we have grown earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 20 percent. Automotive retail earnings

In August, we completed a private placement of $150 million of a new issue of 8 1/4% senior subordinated notes due 2013. We used part of the proceeds from these 8 1/4% notes to retire all of our 10 7/8% senior subordinated notes on their initial redemption date of March 1, 2004. The remaining net proceeds have been used for general corporate purposes. Acquisitions continue to play an important role in our growth strategy. In 2003, we added 10 dealership franchises with anticipated aggregate annual revenues of $333 million. While this fell short of our original goal of $800 million worth

grew 7.2 percent to $4.5 billion as acquisition growth offset same store revenue declines. Rapid growth in our higher-margin parts and ser vice, and finance and insurance businesses, combined with acquisition growth, resulted in gross profit of $723.4 million, a 10.9 percent increase from 2002. Gross margin grew 50 basis points year over year to 16.0 percent as the company continued to benefit from solid growth in our highermargin businesses.

In June, we completed new three-year revolving credit arrangements with 14 leading financial institutions totaling $1.075 billion, with the potential to expand to $1.3 billion. The arrangements consist of a $775 million syndicated credit facility to finance inventor y and working capital, including acquisitions, and a separate $300 million floorplan credit facility to finance Ford Motor Company manufactured new vehicles.

of revenues, it reflects discipline on our part. We continue to seek only highquality platform and tuck-in acquisitions that will be accretive to earnings. Our pipeline of potential acquisitions currently contains such candidates, and with 22,000 dealerships in the United States, we continue to find acquisition candidates that meet our stringent criteria. To date in 2004, we have acquired four franchises with expected annual revenues of $260 million, including a new platform in New Jersey. Our goal is to acquire $1 billion in revenues in 2004, including the four already acquired.

We also enhanced stockholder value in 2003 by repurchasing approximately 463,000 shares of Group 1 common stock at an average price of $31.10 per share. Diversity Key to Continued Growth Our 2003 results reinforce that our strategy of interrelated revenue streams, geographic and brand diversity, and decentralized operations continues to serve our stockholders well by providing a hedge against economic cycles and changing consumer preferences that often plague other types of retail businesses. Group 1's geographic diversity comes from 82 dealerships in 14 platforms across 10

Diversity is also reflected in our revenue mix--new vehicles, used vehicles, parts and service, and finance and insurance. Accounting for 60.6 percent of companywide revenues, new vehicle retail sales grew 8.4 percent to $2.7 billion in 2003, on unit sales of 99,971, up 5.2 percent from 2002. This growth resulted from acquisitions, as well as innovative products and attractive incentives offered by manufacturers. New vehicle sales accounted for 27.6 percent of the company's gross profit and 20.6 percent of pretax profit. Used vehicle retail sales declined slightly to $884.8 million for the year as acquisition

This growth was driven by customers' desires to have their vehicles serviced by our highly qualified service technicians, the expansion of our wholesale parts operation in Oklahoma and acquisitions. Finance and insurance revenues also experienced strong growth in 2003, increasing 15.4 percent to $163.3 million. This business contributed 22.6 percent of the company's gross profit and 23.9 percent of its pretax profit in 2003. Finance and insurance revenues per retail unit sold increased 14.0 percent to $1,003. Positive Long-Term Fundamentals We continue to be excited about the future of

We continue to be pleased with the rapid growth of our higher-margin parts and service, and finance and insurance businesses. Parts and service revenues grew 15.9 percent, to $466.0 million in 2003, and contributed 35.9 percent of gross profit and 43.1 percent of pretax profit.
