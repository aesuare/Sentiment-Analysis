 TO OUR
FELLOW OWNERS,
I’M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT 2012 WAS ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL YEAR. OUR REVENUES GREW TO $11.4 BILLION, A 9.9% INCREASE. DESPITE A CHALLENGING MACRO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, WE ACHIEVED NET REVENUE GROWTH OF 5.2% AND MADE GREAT STRIDES IN OUR LONG-TERM STRATEGY TO BE A LEADING PROVIDER OF GLOBAL TRANSPORTATION AND SUPPLY CHAIN SERVICES. THROUGHOUT 2012, MARGIN COMPRESSION WAS A CHALLENGING FACTOR AND A CONSISTENT DISCUSSION TOPIC IN OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE EMBRACED THIS ISSUE WITH CURRENT INITIATIVES TARGETING ENHANCED PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY TO BENEFIT BOTTOM LINE PERFORMANCE. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO TOP LINE GROWTH AS WELL. DELIVERING EXCEPTIONAL VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS THROUGH OUR STRONG BRANCH NETWORK, SERVICE PORTFOLIO, AND MOTIVATED SALES AND ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT TEAMS PROVIDES A COMPELLING ADVANTAGE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.

       (1) Our net revenues are our total revenues less purchased transportation and related services, including motor carrier, rail, ocean, air, and other costs, and the purchase price and services related to the products we source. Our net revenues are the primary indicator of our ability to source, add value, and sell services and products that are provided by third parties, and we consider them to be our primary performance measurement.
(2) Continuing operations excluding non-recurring acquisition and divestiture expenses and excluding the gain on the divestiture of T-Chek Systems.
(3) Management uses net revenues per employee as a key performance indicator to analyze our productivity, benchmark the financial performance of our branches, and analyze impacts of technology and other investments in our business. The decrease is largely due to the change in our business mix driven primarily by acquisitions in 2012.

 LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

Our global network is stronger than ever
Many companies today seek logistics providers that can integrate all of their supply chain requirements. We have made significant advances this year to satisfy this need. In particular, we have strengthened our capabilities in global forwarding, increased our service offerings on other continents, and implemented our technology platform in offices around the world.
In October, we launched Navisphere®, a single platform that allows customers to communicate worldwide with every party in their supply chain across languages, currencies, and continents.
It offers sophisticated business analytics to help improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands. We believe that these capabilities go well beyond those offered by our competitors, and there has been a great deal of positive feedback since the launch.
Our acquisition of Phoenix International and Apreo Logistics added approximately 2,000 employees and over 40 offices to our network. In North America, we brought new talent to our already strong team of logistics professionals to grow our core business and execute on the promise of service excellence and competitive price value.
Our strong service portfolio uniquely positions us to gain market share
We have always been trusted to deliver strong execution in flexible and innovative ways. Providing access to the largest network of flexible capacity in North America produced double digit volume growth in our combined truckload and less than truckload service offerings in 2012. Our commitment to carriers and service providers remains an important priority,
as well. Utilizing equipment efficiently, reducing empty miles, and providing access to technology
are important factors in the over 56,000 supplier relationships we maintain. Over the past 2 years, we have invested in containers to expand our access to rail networks and sell more programs to committed intermodal rail customers. This investment, which prepares us for future growth opportunities, coincides with expanding railroad investment in intermodal terminals, tracks, and trains.
« FIND OUT MORE ABOUT OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
Our Ocean and Air offerings are more competitive
and efficient as we leverage the scale of our legacy
and acquired businesses. While growth in the global forwarding industry has slowed in recent years, we believe international trade will continue to drive solid long-term growth potential in global logistics demand. Steamship lines and the ports are investing for more growth, adding bigger ships, more ports, and more lanes. We look forward to our opportunities to take additional market share in this area.
Increasingly, companies prefer to outsource some or all of their transportation and supply chain requirements. Our management services provide the people and technology resources that are so essential to managing global trade. We now have four global Control TowersTM in Chicago, Amsterdam, Mumbai, and Shanghai to manage all the details of shipments: routing guide management, freight forwarding, customs brokerage, vendor and supplier compliance, trade management, and modal conversion services.
Our Sourcing service line continues to evolve as one of the largest producers, marketers, and distributors of fresh products and services in North America.
As part of our ongoing strategy, we continue to grow market share globally in our strategic fresh produce product categories. Our high quality and innovative approach to fresh products, excellence in temperature controlled distribution and transportation, and our supply and demand management services position us as a market leader. We are well situated for growth in the increasingly global produce industry.
In October, we sold our payment services business, T-Chek Systems, Inc. As the payment services industry
evolves, scale and alignment within the financial services sector are becoming increasingly important. This factor drove our decision to sell T-Chek to Electronic Funds Source, LLC to provide T-Chek with the best opportunity for long term success.
The customer drives everything we do
The ever changing business climate has perhaps never been as challenging. Delivering a superior experience and outcome is still our highest priority. With all the changes and complex needs in the marketplace, one thing has not changed: our commitment to help our

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS DRAW CUSTOMERS TO US AND ALLOW US TO CAPTURE MARKET SHARE.
1 NETWORK
Companies can’t oversee every shipment, but we can. Customers appreciate our boots-on-the-ground attention and expertise for all parts of their worldwide supply chains.
2 PORTFOLIO OF SERVICES
In the dynamic world of volatile markets, companies don’t always know which freight and supply chain service offers the best value. We analyze their requirements and are able to recommend the best course of action.
3 SCALE
Companies of all sizes look to us for distinct advantages in cost and service. They are drawn to our ability to leverage huge shipment volumes.
4 RELATIONSHIPS
Shrinking headcount and complicated logistics send companies looking for an advisor they can trust. They depend on us to deliver innovative solutions and best practices.

Companies can’t afford to focus on non-core functions. They rely on our ability to source and develop people— smart, dedicated, and empowered—to serve customers for knowledge and problem solving.
6 STABILITY
Companies want to work with financially and operationally strong providers. They trust us because of our lack of debt and consistent reinvestment in capabilities. All of it adds up to this: we’re in this business for the long term.
7 TECHNOLOGY
Companies are reducing in-house expertise. They
are attracted by our robust global operating platform, automation, and willingness to customize to meet their specific requirements.

 LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
(CONTINUED)
customers improve their supply chains and capitalize on their growth potential. We know that our people, processes, and technology are as important as ever in allowing our customers to accelerate their advantage in the growth of their businesses. We served over 42,000 customers in 2012 in 32 countries, more than any year before. We continue to invest in our account management programs to execute and innovate. Inventing new solutions to optimize performance is what excites and motivates us. Our qualified sales teams are engaged in the pursuit of growth in the universe of opportunity that is the global logistics market. Estimates vary, but by any measure, we are
a small percentage of the North American truck market and a much smaller percentage of the overall global market.
Looking ahead
We feel good about our progress and are confident that our strategy is the right one. We are as committed as ever to our growth goals and know that our size, financial stability, and industry leading technology will continue to serve us well as we progress forward in 2013 and beyond. Our industry is evolving and the

solutions of the future will likely be quite different from those of the past. We take our challenges seriously, such as integrating existing and new employees, customers, and suppliers, and growing our market share across all services. We are prepared to deliver successfully on those challenges.

Also, to our shareholders, thank you for your trust in our team. We hope that you are as excited as we are about your company’s current performance and the opportunities that lie ahead.
