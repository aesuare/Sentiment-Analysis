DEAR FELLOW SHAREOWNERS,
The current economic downturn hit almost without warning, leading experts from Wall Street to Main Street to search for easy explanations. But, at FedEx, we know that a time of great chal- lenge is also a time of great opportunity, a time to step back and take a look at the larger perspective.
In any annual report, the consolidated financial results capture just one snapshot in time. But there’s a larger FedEx picture here for fiscal year 2001 – a picture of solid first-half revenue growth, improved cash flows and effective yield management.
FY01 Financial Results
To view this big picture, look behind the numbers for the full year ended May 31, 2001, and examine the breakdowns for the first and second half:
• Annual revenue increased 8% to a record $19.6 billion, fueled by first-half revenue growth of 9%. Second-half revenue was also above year-ago levels, but grew at a slower 6% pace.
• Net income decreased 15% to $584 million for the year, despite a first-half increase of 10%. In the second half, net income dropped 38%.
• Earnings per share of $1.99 included a first-half contribution of $1.25, up 15% over the prior year. The second-half contribution declined 39% causing EPS to fall 14% for the full year.
The question is clear: What happened between the first and sec- ond half? Certainly, the second-half numbers include one-time charges associated with curtailing certain aircraft modification and development programs and reorganizing operations at FedEx Supply Chain Services. But larger issues are also at play.
Slowing Consumer Demand
Historically, times of economic slowdown can be traced to a fun- damental imbalance between supply and demand. Our current economic situation is no exception.
After strong growth in consumer demand over a number of years – particularly the demand for high-tech goods – many companies ramped up supply only to discover that demand had dropped sharply. In some cases, faulty business models collapsed entirely. But the result was historically familiar – inventory oversupply led to increased obsolescence. For FedEx companies, that translated to softer demand for transportation and, specifically, for express transportation tied to the high-tech and durable goods sectors.

In the second half of this fiscal year, the U.S. economy fell harder than we expected, and the domestic downturn had a ripple effect on select international markets, particularly Asia, which is heavily integrated into U.S. high-tech manufacturing.
It was a wild ride on the economic pendulum, swinging from the promise of the new Digital Economy back to an Industrial Economy in a cyclical correction. Now, we find that pendulum moving back toward the center as excess is wrung out of the inventory buildup of last year and as manufacturers begin to come back into balance.
The shakeout in the “dot-com” sector and the rationalization of a number of overbuilt sectors seem largely behind us now.
When the economy picks up – hopefully sooner rather than later – FedEx customers can take advantage of the upturn by selecting the right mode of transportation with the right level of informa- tion intensity. By better managing both the supply chain and the demand cycle, we can all manage our way back to growth in a healthy economy.
A Fiscally Responsible FedEx
How did FedEx continue to increase revenue and yields in this difficult economy? With prudent financial management through
pricing as well as customer and product mix. In addition, we deferred or cut capital spending and imposed very diligent inter- nal cost controls on travel, entertainment, outside services, new hires and other discretionary spending. Given the slowdown in volume, we began to “right-size” our transportation networks, making sure that we don’t carry excess capacity any more than our customers carry obsolete inventory.
All the while, we remained focused on the five growth strategies that we presented to employees beginning in September 2000:
• Grow our core transportation business.
• Grow internationally.
• Grow our logistics and supply chain offerings. • Grow through e-commerce.
• Grow through new services or alliances.
It may sound incongruous to be focused on growth during an eco- nomic decline, but our real challenge is to respond to temporary market corrections without sacrificing long-term opportunity. One year of soft results will not change our commitment to growth or deter us from our goals – improving EPS by 10% to 15% per year, increasing cash flow, improving margins and increasing our return on capital. In this regard, we will continue to manage our revenue based not just on volume but on yield as well.

The Diversified FedEx Portfolio
Perhaps the most significant difference in our response to this economic slowdown versus the 1990–91 recession is a simple fact: FedEx is not the same company we were then. In 1991, we were a $7.7 billion business focused exclusively on express trans- portation. Our international network was incomplete. While we had made significant investments in technology, the Internet as we know it did not exist.
Today, FedEx has expanded and diversified its portfolio to com- pete across a wide spectrum of the transportation market. FedEx offers the broadest range of transportation, logistics and infor- mation services of any company, anywhere – express, ground, freight and even expedited delivery. And we’ve leveraged the strength of that portfolio over the past year.
When U.S. demand for FedEx Express transportation began to wane in the second half of last year, the FedEx Ground business continued to grow. In February, we completed the acquisition of American Freightways and created FedEx Freight, which over- sees our regional less-than-truckload freight services, including Viking Freight in the western United States. No competitor can match the scope and breadth of our transportation services in general and our freight offering in particular.
Our FY01 performance, even during tough economic times, con- firms that the FedEx philosophy of operating independently and competing collectively is working, particularly the adjustments we made in January 2000, when we rebranded our major operat- ing companies and reorganized to better meet customer needs. It’s clear now that our customers are responding positively to these strategic changes.
Strong Customer Relationships
When the Smithsonian Institution’s National Zoological Park needed reliable delivery of two pandas from China, FedEx was the obvious choice. When Ford Motor Company needed around-the- clock, critical-parts support for its commercial truck customers, FedEx won the business. Wal-Mart, Compaq, General Motors and other valued customers have recently honored FedEx companies as “carrier of the year.”
In January, we announced major new service agreements between FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service. In one agreement, FedEx Express agreed to provide air transportation for certain Postal Service products, beginning in August 2001. The U.S. Postal Service also agreed to the placement of FedEx Drop Boxes outside U.S. Post Offices nationwide, beginning in March 2001.
These landmark public-private agreements create a winning busi- ness alliance. The Postal Service wins with access to reliable, consolidated air transportation service. FedEx was the only transportation company with the capacity and expertise to make that happen. FedEx wins by generating an estimated $7 billion in revenue over the life of the seven-year contract. And the American public wins with greater choice, flexibility and convenience for their shipping needs.
Superior FedEx Technology
One interesting byproduct of the Postal Service business alliance is the advanced technology that will allow FedEx to scan and read postal bar codes. It’s in keeping with our customer-focused technology – helping our customers link seamlessly to the FedEx system and use information to help manage their business.
The FedEx Web site (fedex.com) is one of the most renowned and easiest to use, and we have continued to enhance our leading- edge, Internet technology. This year alone, we relaunched the site to integrate express and ground functionality, introduced a powerful suite of international shipping tools called FedEx Global Trade ManagerSM, opened the online market to small- and medium-sized businesses with FedEx eCommerce Builder, and announced the development of FedEx InSightSM to enhance ship- ment visibility and control for select customers.
For over two decades, FedEx has been the industry leader in cus- tomer automation, and now we’re moving from the desktop to the wireless environment. FedEx was the first transportation com- pany to be listed on the AT&T Digital PocketNet Service, and in the coming months we plan to expand our wireless capabilities to improve service and productivity.
As we’ve been saying since the late 1970s, the information about a package is just as important as the delivery of the package itself. That’s why FedEx is dedicated to integrated transportation and information services – so we can deliver meaningful solu- tions for customers in today’s complex business environment.
Unsurpassed Global Reach
FedEx entered this economic slowdown as a strong, diversified company – and we will come out even stronger. After all, we emerged from the 1998–99 “Asian Flu” as the leader in Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan and Malaysia, in addition to our long-standing
No. 1 position in China, where we currently serve 190 cities with 11 weekly flights.
Our two strongest international regions – Asia-Pacific and Europe – continued their growth trends during FY01. In Europe,

 apparent with 21% volume growth in the first half, slowing to just 3% growth in the second half for an overall 12% annual growth rate. But, to stay focused on the larger picture, remember that the operative word internationally is “growth” – and it continues to surpass U.S. domestic volume gains.
As we focus on maximizing our global network and moving our product mix more toward higher-yielding FedEx International Priority® shipments, we are also looking ahead to future inter- national needs. In January, FedEx Express announced it intends to acquire the Airbus A380-800F high-capacity, long-range air- craft, taking delivery beginning in 2008. The A380 will be capable of flying directly between Asia, Europe and U.S. hubs with nearly twice the payload of current MD11 aircraft. Also in FY01, we added our first converted MD10s to the domestic system, with modifications to enhance mechanical reliability and to reconfig- ure the cockpit for two crew members instead of three. Both changes will help us run our global air system more efficiently while maintaining superior, on-time service for our customers.
What Happens Next?
Over the years, we have carefully diversified across global regions and across transportation sectors to create a strong and growing FedEx. If there’s a secret to our success, it lies in our bal- anced physical, information and human networks.
The FedEx technology network enables real-time information to help customers manage supply and demand on a global scale.
And, on a personal note, let me add that FedEx has the best human network anywhere – a culture long recognized as a great place to work with a passion for customer service. When I faced heart bypass surgery in late November, I knew that this company would continue under the leadership of the strongest manage- ment team we’ve ever fielded – and that more than 215,000 employ- ees and contractors all around the world would always rise to any challenge. I’d like to say, once more, a public “thank you” for the overwhelming support that hastened my complete recovery.
It’s all about perspective. In a year when others faltered, FedEx increased revenue, improved yield-per-package and generated a return for our shareowners. As soon as the imbalance of supply and demand rights itself, FedEx will leverage the strength of our global family of companies – and the strength of our customer relationships – not just to resume our own record of profitable growth, but to help restore growth for our customers.
