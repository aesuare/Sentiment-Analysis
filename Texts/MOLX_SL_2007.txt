LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

More than ever, it is one world. Since 2000, the number of our customers functioning globally has exploded--today, more than 70 percent come to us with projects that cross two or more regions. More than ever, we are one company. We have moved from a regional structure to a global approach in product design, development and manufacturing. We also have created a unified global sales and marketing organization to present one face to the customer. We now are better able than ever to provide any Molex product to any customer, anywhere in the world--faster, more efficiently and more profitably.





A y e a r of ch a nge For Molex, fiscal 2007 was a year in which we moved

away from our traditional geographic division-based structure. It was a year in which we completed and integrated the largest acquisition in our history. Unfortunately, it also was a year in which we saw record performance in the first quarter turn to disappointing results as the year progressed.  This is our most important message to you this year: We believe we created a better Molex in 2007. By making the transition from a strong global but regionally focused company to an even stronger, increasingly streamlined, globally aligned player, we have improved our ability to serve our global customers and deliver profitable growth over the long term.  Our new structure, which was effective July 1, 2007, is more than an improvement in how we are organized and operate. Without compromising our strong culture, we have created the framework for a much more globally collaborative mindset at Molex. We have a great deal of work ahead, but we are excited at the possibilities this change creates for us.

As many of you know, we started the year with tremendous momentum, only to see a softening in bookings and significant price erosion as the year progressed, particularly among our larger mobile phone, consumer and datacom customers. Meanwhile, raw material and other operating costs continued to rise, led by gold and copper prices. These forces combined to negatively impact our margins.  Despite the momentum change during the year, we reached record highs 03 04 05 07 both in revenue and net income. Revenue increased 14 06 percent from $2.86 billion in fiscal 2006 to $3.27 billion in fiscal 2007, while net income increased from $236 million to $241 million. But these accomplishments were overshadowed by year-over-year declines in net return on sales, gross margins and return on invested capital.  There were, however, some other important positives in our financial performance. Fiscal 2007 marked the first time we have surpassed the $3 billion net revenue milestone, a $400 million-plus increase that, in absolute dollars, is the largest we have realized in our history. We continued to make progress in our efforts to reduce selling, general and05 administrative (SG&A) 03 04 06 07 costs, reaching 20.1 percent of revenue, down from 21.1 percent in fiscal 2006. Our capital expenditures now are at approximately 9.1 percent of sales, which is a considerable improvement over capex that was as high as 14 percent of sales in the 1990s.

of our new organizational structure this fiscal year with the launch of the Commercial Products, Micro Products, Automation and Electrical Products, and Integrated Products divisions. We implemented phase I with the launch of our Transportation Products Division and our new global sales and marketing organization in fiscal 2006. Our fiscal 2007 results were not the reason for our restructuring--in fact, as our margins began to contract, we already were 03 into 04 05 07 to create a more efficient, focused and aligned more than a year our 06 plans organizational structure for Molex.  The two-year process of putting a new organization in place has underscored the opportunities and benefits we see in changing to a truly global approach. We now are better able to do the right things in the right places with the right resources to serve our customers and improve our results. But reorganizing globally at our scale obviously is not a simple one-step process. The new structure is in place; fully realizing the benefits will take time. That said, we already levels of cross-regional collabora03 are 04 seeing 05 06 unprecedented 07 tion and coordination. We are convinced that we are on the right path.

of Woodhead Industries during the year brings a very strong, broad global business to Molex and doubles the percentage of our sales that comes from the industrial market. We now are one of the top-three players in this sector, in an excellent position to grow a lower-volume, higher-margin business that adds stability and balance to our portfolio. The margins in this business were attractive to begin with, and we anticipate even higher profits 03 04 05 06 07 and returns as we continue to realize integration synergies.

Successf u l L e a n/Si x Sigm A l au nch During the year, we successfully

launched a companywide Lean and Six Sigma program, a global initiative to achieve breakthrough improvements in product quality, customer delivery and service performance, and cost competitiveness. We have thus far trained 36 black belts, put more than 175 teams in place and initiated over 200 projects at 11 sites across our global organization. We are just beginning to see traction, but based on cost savings alone, the program already has provided a full return on our original investment.

and winning new designs still are the major drivers of success in our business. In spite of margin pressures throughout the year, we continued our industryleading levels of investment in product development, launching more than 300 new products in fiscal 2007.  With our new organizational structure in place, we are in a much better position to leverage leading-edge technologies we develop for our large global accounts to benefit mid-tier customers in the same industries. Further, placing management responsibility for product development with each global division will reduce duplication of effort and improve return on investment in this critical function.
SPECI A L TH A N K S At the end of fiscal 2007, Joe King retired from Molex after

32 years of exemplary service. We thank you, Joe, and wish you the very best--your energy, integrity and values have been an inspiration to all of us.
Ou tlook We've never been more confident as we look to the future of your

company. We expect to see improvements in returns, gross margin and SG&A as we rationalize assets and achieve other efficiencies from the new organization. Against estimated pre-tax charges of $100­125 million over the course of the next two years related to these actions, we expect to realize somewhere in the range of $75­100 million in annual pre-tax cost savings.  We believe the electronics industry will continue to grow, and we intend to continue to strive aggressively to outgrow it. With a new structure designed to better align the efforts of one of the most talented and dedicated groups in the world--the people of Molex--we see almost limitless potential to gain market share and profitably grow our business.  We look forward to reporting on our progress in the months and years ahead.
