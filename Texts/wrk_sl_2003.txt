Dear Shareholders, Customers and Rock-Tenn Team Members:
We have a very high aspiration for Rock-Tenn Company;
we want to be the best company in our business. Our perfor- mance during fiscal year 2003 demonstrates that we are making our aspiration our reality. Our 2003 performance also underlined the challenges that we face to continually execute at the level necessary to be the best in our business.

 Rock-Tenn Company
2003 Annual Report
Letter to Shareholpdger.s1(continued)
During fiscal year 2003, we worked hard to improve the competitive position of our folding carton business, our largest business. We invested $105 million in 2003, including $81 million to acquire Cartem Wilco and Pacific Coast Packaging. The $65 million Cartem Wilco acquisition builds on our strong existing folding carton operations in Canada and provides us the opportunity to expand WilcoÕs position in the demanding hair care and cosmetics segments of the folding carton market. The $16 million Pacific Coast Packaging transaction gives us a strong presence on the West Coast in the food service markets. We now have four Rock- Tenn folding carton plants across the United States serving these growing markets.
We believe that our continued relentless focus on improving our cost structure through operations improvements and investments in technology, accompanied by these strategic acquisitions, are making Rock-Tenn Company the strongest competitor in the folding carton industry. We believed at the beginning of the year that our progress would be best proven if we were able to increase our sales in 2003. Fiscal 2003 folding carton sales did increase, particularly over the last half of the year. In fact, during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003, our physical volumes of folding cartons shipped increased by 9 percent over 2002 (and with our acqui- sitions, cartons shipped increased 17 percent). We achieved this growth even though total consumer nondurable goods output (to which folding carton sales are highly correlated) fell 2.4 percent* during the same period.
We continued to invest in our people and processes in our merchandising displays and corrugated packaging business to build on the growth we have achieved over the past five years. During fiscal 2003, we broadened and deepened our display customer relationships, reducing the concentration of our business in our largest customers. Our recycled paperboard mills produced a wide variety of very consis- tent, high-quality recycled paperboard grades because of the strong capital

investment we have made in our mills over the past five years and because of the highly motivated overachievers at Rock-Tenn who operate our mills.
As a manufacturing company, we believe that we need to do two things right to succeed. We need to have the lowest costs of all our competitors, and we need to give our customers the highest quality and service they can get. This means relentlessly attacking waste, continuously improving the quality and consistency of our products and providing unparalleled customer service. We pursued these goals through our Six Sigma program and relentless focus on cost reduction and quality and service initiatives, which we estimate added over $20 million to our bottom line during fiscal year 2003.
We also strive to make our workplace a safe place for all our employees. In 2003, Rock-Tenn employees incurred 27 percent fewer recordable injuries than last year. Our OSHA total recordable incident rate of 1.70 was the best perfor- mance in the history of Rock-Tenn Company.
For all of these successes, we are constantly challenged to operate flawlessly,
to capture all the savings we think we can capture and to obtain prices that reflect the value we bring to our customers. We struggle to realize adequate margins because of the overcapacity that exists in most of our markets and the increasing concentration of our business that results from the consolidation of large con- sumer products companies. Driven by these challenges, the industry has shuttered or idled 10 mills or paper machines representing about 638,000 tons of recycled paperboard capacity (of which 75,000 tons were ours) since September 2002. We believe these actions have brought capacity much closer to balance with demand, both in clay-coated recycled boxboard for folding carton markets and in specialty grades. We believe these capacity reductions will result in better opportunities
for us in 2004, particularly if the recovery expands to create growth in consumer nondurables manufacturing and packaged food production. We also believe we

can operate better in all of our businesses and that provides continuing incentives for improvement for all of the 8,500 employees at Rock-Tenn Company.
We invested in our plastics packaging business over the past four years to upgrade our manufacturing facilities and market presence. Even though we created a much more capable and profitable competitor, we felt our business would be more valuable to a strategic acquirer with a much greater presence in these markets. We decided to test this premise in 2003 and as a result sold this business to Pactiv Corporation in October for $60 million, and we expect to recognize a $7 million after-tax gain in 2004. This sale provides us with much greater focus and financial resources to devote to our paperboard packaging businesses.
We continue to generate significant cash, both through operations, where our operating cash flow was $115 million, and through a reduction of capital expendi- tures to $57 million in fiscal year 2003 (from $73 million in 2002) made possible by our heavy investments of the last few years. Our financial position and strong cash flow provided the basis for the increase in our annual dividend rate of $0.02 per share for the second consecutive year to $0.34 per share.
On balance, and in a very difficult economic climate for manufacturing, fiscal year 2003 was a successful year for Rock-Tenn Company, and if we can continue to improve, we can make fiscal year 2004 even more successful and make our aspiration of being the best company in our business our reality.
Sincerely,
James A. Rubright
