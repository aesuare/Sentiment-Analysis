We are pleased to share with you that fiscal 2010 was another record year for The J. M. Smucker Company as
we continued to focus on Our Purpose of bringing families together to share memorable meals and moments. Our results demonstrate that when our employees focus on a shared purpose and implementing a clear strategy, strong financial performance follows:
• Sales were $4.6 billion, up 23 percent over last year.
• Net income per share was $4.15, up from $3.11 last year,
a 33 percent increase.
• Cash flow from operations exceeded $713 million, up 60 percent over last year.
Strong cash flows provide us with a number of opportu- nities to create additional shareholder value in the future. These opportunities include future growth through acquisi- tions, dividend payments, share repurchase programs,
and capital investments. In fact, we recently announced a 14 percent increase in our quarterly dividend.
Several key strategic accomplishments over the past year have contributed to our strong momentum and outstand- ing Company results:
• Achieved market share growth across a number of our core categories.
• Successfully completed the remaining activities associ- ated with integrating the Folgers coffee business with our broader portfolio of brands and Company infrastructure.
• Realized the first full year of synergies associated with managing the Folgers coffee business as part of The J. M. Smucker Company.
• Grew Dunkin’ Donuts coffee in retail volume, which represented the fastest growing brand in our Company portfolio.
• Delivered significant sales, profits, and cash flow from the coffee business.
• Strengthened core brand equities across our entire portfolio of brands through an unprecedented level of investment in print, digital, and television advertising.
• Leveraged the power of our diverse categories and prod- ucts through multi-brand promotional events that invited consumers to include even more of our products as part of their family meals.
• Introduced new, better-for-you product alternatives, including but not limited to Pillsbury sugar-free cake mixes, brownies, and frostings — the first sugar-free alternatives in the dessert baking mix category — offering consumers even more ways to enjoy our brands.
• Continued our strong commitment to sustainability so that we can create a better tomorrow through economic, environmental, and social programs.
• Enjoyed and preserved the unique Company culture that makes Smucker a great place to work.
We were proud that our Company was once again recognized by FORTUNE magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For.” This recognition is a testament to our employees. We thank them for their continued passion and dedication to our business.
Long-Term Perspective
Achieving solid financial results and growing our business were important objectives that we were proud to deliver this past fiscal year. However, we believe that an even more important measure of success is providing strong results and value to our constituents — consumers, customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and shareholders — over the long term.
A commitment to continuous improvement is essential to ensuring our ongoing success. Our employees are committed to continuously improving our brands, prod- ucts, business processes, operational practices, and cost structure.
Most significantly, we announced this past year the strategic decision to invest in the long-term strength and profitability of our coffee and fruit spreads businesses with the largest capital investment in our Company’s history. This multi-project initiative will help achieve our long-term financial objectives, better allocate capacity and assets across the supply chain, and strengthen our category lead- ership positions. This decision, while right for the ongoing strength of the businesses, was a difficult one because of the impact on many of our employees as a result of the planned closing of four manufacturing facilities.
Looking to the future, we will continue to strengthen our work environment and unique culture. Over the next few years, we will make significant investments at our

corporate headquarters location in Orrville, Ohio, to sup- port recent and future growth. We will open a new office building, expand an existing building that will add to our research and development capabilities, and build a state- of-the-art manufacturing facility.
Our culture, emphasis on growth, and focus on continu- ous improvement have long contributed to our success. These investments are only the most recent examples of our commitment to these areas.
Our Purpose
During fiscal 2010, we extended Our Purpose of bringing families together to share memorable meals and moments to more consumers than ever before. We continue to believe in the far-reaching benefits of family mealtime. Families that eat together are stronger, smarter, healthier, and happier.
To best fulfill Our Purpose and deliver sustained results we are guided by our strategic vision to own and market North American food brands that hold the #1 market posi- tion in their respective category. We remain confident in this North American focused strategy and will also continue to embrace a global perspective.
Having the right strategic focus is essential, but how we work to fulfill our strategy is what makes The J. M. Smucker Company unique. Our Basic Beliefs — Quality, People, Ethics, Growth, and Independence — are the guideposts for every- thing we do. They are the fabric of our culture and have enabled us to build trust with our constituents for genera- tions. That trust is the confidence that constituents place
in our Company, our brands, and our products. We do not take this trust for granted and work to maintain it every day — one product at a time.
We thank you for your investment in The J. M. Smucker Company and look forward to our continued partnership.
Sincerely,
  Tim Smucker
