Annual reports are, by their nature, retrospective. But this year the message is very much about the future. I arrived here just a few days after the New Year, and I believe I've arrived at the beginning of something extraordinary. This is a company with a long history of service to America's elderly. I look at those decades of service, and it's extremely gratifying to know that I am part of a team that takes that mission to heart. I believe we have dedicated people doing great work that has resulted in a fantastic market position. Our commitment has made Omnicare the industry leader with significant market share--an achievement few American companies attain. Because of Omnicare's history, Omnicare's people, and Omnicare's outstanding market position, I believe we're poised to do great things.

be second to none.

Clear Operational Priorities
In the months leading up to my arrival, there evolved a heightened operational focus at Omnicare, and I share this view without reservation. The heart of a successful and prosperous organization is finely tuned operations that fulfill customer needs while exceeding the promises of marketing and sales. Parts of Omnicare already have that capability, and this combination of drive, ef ficiency and service will be leveraged to establish customer centered operations as a hallmark of our business. But even the most effective organization cannot--by itself--drive growth. For this reason, as Omnicare realizes its potential for operational excellence, its growth will be driven by a motivated sales force and by strategic, targeted marketing. Here are steps we're taking to accomplish that goal.

Denny Shelton began in 2010, during his tenure as interim CEO. Standardization of performance reviews, compensation adjustments, performance rewards, as well as re-alignment of roles and responsibilities, remain a top priority throughout the corporation. And we are recruiting dynamic new talent into Omnicare's management structure. By treating our employees with respect and providing the right leadership, training and development to help them succeed, I believe we will strengthen our potential for future growth and increase the value realized by our shareholders. Investing in our employees helps create an environment that mirrors our vision for customers--an exceptional experience that delivers value and satisfaction each day. Serving the Customer. Loyal customers are the

Transforming Our Culture. Omnicare's success depends on the success of its employees, who are key drivers of the company's growth. Some of my first actions as Chief Executive Of ficer have been to reemphasize and build upon the important changes that Board Chairman

foundation of growth and consequent benefit to shareholders. For that reason, I believe an Omnicare customer should be a customer for life, a goal that requires continuous attention to quality, listening and adapting to customers' needs, and demonstrating the

value our services provide. Our role--our commitment to our customers--is helping them maintain the health and well-being of the people in their care. Here is where our extensive knowledge, as well as the depth of our clinical expertise in geriatric pharmacy, make a critical difference. Positive outcomes are what matter in our industry, and this is where Omnicare does, and will continue to, excel. Beyond that, one of the ways we've moved our customers forward is through the technology we provide. Our leadership in customer-facing technology--and in pharmacy automation--gives us the opportunity to significantly enhance the experience our clients have. Omnicare is committed to further investment in electronic solutions that are close to the customer. It is my belief that these capabilities and enhancements help us deepen our current relationships, and heighten our attractiveness with prospects. I believe customers

will come to us, and customers will stay with us, because the Omnicare experience will be second to none. Refocusing the Organization. Assembled within Omnicare are two divisions that will define our longterm growth: Long-Term Care and Specialty Care. We will continue to develop collaborative business units by aligning resources within the organization that are currently dedicated to these markets. In addition, it is my belief that Omnicare's potential as a vertical organization is outstanding. We have expertise in research, sourcing, technology, distribution, and payor relations-- resources that can be developed and leveraged to serve customers throughout both divisions. The fact that these organizational capabilities already exist within Omnicare is a perfect example of the enormous potential I see for growth and shareholder benefit.

Compelling Industry Developments. Over decades, we've risen to the top in long-term care pharmacy, with significant market share across North America for Omnicare's highly successful, clinically excellent pharmacy business. In addition, our Omniview portal provides a web-based worksite solution that furthers our mission to help customers

generate positive outcomes and have ready access to critical information. Business opportunities for longterm care continue to grow. Projections indicate that, by 2020, the percentage of adults between age 65 and 84 will increase to nearly half the adult population, and this trend will continue for decades thereafter.

of important drugs widely prescribed in elder care, such as Plavix and Lidoderm, will expire in the next two years. This market shift will provide compelling cost savings for our customers while offering a very attractive opportunity for Omnicare. Within our industry, I believe we are uniquely positioned to have a sustained benefit from the launch of new generic drugs. As the largest purchaser of generics within the long-term

care channel, it is my belief that our scale, coupled with a very sophisticated purchasing organization, provides us with an unparalleled advantage. With favorable market factors, and a commitment to delivering exceptional, value-based, customer service that will maintain and build our customer base, I believe Omnicare will enjoy healthy growth in long-term care.

As specialty drugs assume a larger share of the prescription drug market, Omnicare's presence in Specialty Care will be an important growth driver.

Expanding Our Presence in Specialty Care. Recognizing a key growth opportunity, Omnicare has already established a firm foothold in the rapidly growing markets of specialty pharmaceuticals and hospice pharmacy. Advanced Care Scripts and RxCrossroads provide clinical innovation, third-party logistics, key commercialization, and other services for cancer care, multiple sclerosis, emerging biotech therapies, and many other growing areas. In addition, our dedicated hospice pharmacy, excelleRx, is the leading provider in that important category. Market conditions are in our favor. Ten years ago, specialty medications comprised just nine percent

of all drugs prescribed. By 2014, it's projected that specialty pharmaceuticals will represent 23 percent of the prescription drug market. For Omnicare, our Specialty Care group exited 2010 with a two-year compound annual growth rate for revenues exceeding 20 percent, demonstrating what I believe is a firm basis for growth. By leveraging pharmaceutical and provider relationships across our organization, we can build business quickly in this market. At the same time, we will apply resources and expertise from Specialty Care to continue building revenue in LongTerm Care pharmacy.

Building Growth with Integrity
In 2011, we will continue to drive change that we believe is in the best interest of our shareholders. Critical to this mission is a continued focus on strengthening the company's corporate governance and increasing transparency. We extend our sincere thanks and gratitude to former Board Chairman John Crotty and Board member John Timoney upon their retirement. As we move forward in replacing their positions, we anticipate that the new insights and experience of incoming executives will help us further advance both our shareholder interests and our governance initiatives.

Because of Omnicare's history, Omnicare's people, and Omnicare's outstanding market position,

Today, I believe Omnicare possesses outstanding potential for long-term -- and short-term -- shareholder value. In 2010, we returned 31 percent of cash flow from operations directly to shareholders, through dividends and through share repurchases. Going forward, we will continue to focus on developing shareholder benefit in visible, tangible ways. Poised for what I believe will be powerful, sustained growth, Omnicare is taking off from the platform it has built so successfully over the last 30 years. Through an impressive history of service, a dedicated team of professionals has brought us to the success we enjoy today. From here, our commitment to our employees, and through them to our customers, will take us forward as a company and realize ongoing value for shareholders. If we are passionate in serving those who use our services, there will be abundant reasons for new customers to choose Omnicare. If we are faithful in making the right choices to help them succeed, there will be no reason a customer should ever voluntarily leave. I believe that few companies enjoy the opportunities for growth that stand before Omnicare today. I am fortunate to be part of this organization, and I am confident there are great days ahead.

I believe we're poised to do great things.
