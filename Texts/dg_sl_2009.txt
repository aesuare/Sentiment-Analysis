                                                               hello!
Welcome to the New Dollar General
1
  At Dollar General, we have been serving customers with our unique combination of value and convenience for over 70 years. Today, with more than 8,800 stores in 35 states and nearly 80,000 members of the Dollar General team, we are serving more customers than ever. Dollar General stores offer great values on quality consumables and
basic everyday home, apparel and seasonal merchandise, and we go a step farther, by providing a comfort- able, personal and friendly shopping environment. Our customer is anyone who can appreciate our great value proposition to “Save time. Save money. Every day!” and, we believe, that should be just about everyone.
        
To Our Fellow Shareholders,
Customers, and Employees:
Welcome to the New Dollar General! That’s right! Without question, we have entered a new era at Dollar General and have laid the right foundations to support our continuing evolution. In doing so, I believe we have made great progress in redefining small-box retailing.

Rick Dreiling
Chairman and CEO
We have worked a great deal on elevating the look and feel of our stores and enhancing the customer shopping experi- ence. We’ve also improved our operations and infrastructure, implemented a new private branding strategy, introduced a more sophisticated real estate strategy and developed a more disciplined approach to cost control. As a result, Dollar General is becoming known as a new and improved destination for value-conscious, convenience-seeking customers who are looking for time-saving solutions.
Our efforts not only improved our business and strengthened our relationships with customers but they also allowed us to achieve a critical milestone. On November 13, 2009, we rejoined the public equity market, strengthening our capital structure and providing access to investors, in order to help us to execute our growth strategy. Having operated as a private company since July 2007, our initial public offering was yet another step in a long track record of success at Dollar General and, notably, was the largest retail IPO in nearly 14 years.
Our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model: providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday needs, and helping them make the most of their spending dollars with a wide selection of quality items at everyday low prices in conveniently located, easy-to-shop stores. It is by adhering to this model that we were once again able to produce exceptional operating results in 2009.
A Great Year for Dollar General
Dollar General accomplished a great deal in 2009. Highlights from the year include:
• A sales increase of 12.8% to a record $11.8 billion.
• Same-store sales growth of 9.5%. Notably, we marked our
20th consecutive year of positive same-store sales
growth, which is almost unheard of in the retail industry. • Expanded gross margin, which increased 201 basis points
to 31.3%.
• A reduction in adjusted selling, general and administrative
expenses as a percentage of sales by 79 basis points.
• Net income of $339.4 million, or $1.04 per diluted share.
Adjusting for several charges related mainly to the IPO, net income for the full year was $425.1 million, or $1.31 per diluted share.
• Adjusted Earnings before Interest Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) growth of 41%.
• Debt reduction of $734 million.
• The opening of 500 new stores and remodeling or
relocation of an additional 450 stores, which created about 4,000 new jobs throughout the year.
Our results are testament to the fact that our existing and new customers are responding extremely well to our value and convenience proposition.
Our Continued Commitment to Our Associates
At Dollar General we are focused on attracting, developing and retaining talented employees. This commitment and the dedication of our store associates were key drivers
of our accomplishments in 2009.
Through enhanced training initiatives and a clear focus on developing career paths for our store associates, we have been able to improve employee retention at all levels. Our first employee engagement survey proved that we have

 successfully cultivated an
engaged workforce, as
Dollar General placed in the
top quartile in the retail
industry. Additionally, our
improved resources and
training programs enabled
us to reduce store manager
turnover to its lowest level
in 16 years. We also main-
tained our commitment to
helping our associates grow within Dollar General. In 2009, 46 percent of available store manager opportunities were filled by internal promotions.
Our employees are Dollar General’s most important asset. Across the Company, associates in our more than 8,800 stores nationwide work tirelessly every day to deliver our value and convenience proposition to our customers. With about one billion customer transactions a year, these associates strive to exceed the expectations of each and every one of our customers. It is because of the commit- ment and dedication of our 80,000 associates that we were able to accomplish such great things in 2009, and I have confidence that their engagement will lead to an even better 2010.
Dollar General’s Future is Bright
It’s evident that consumers have made significant behav- ioral changes during the current recession, and most have reset their spending norm. As we work to enhance the Dollar General experience and maintain an intense focus on our customer service standards, we are confident that consumers will continue to turn to Dollar General for their everyday needs, even as the economy begins to recover.
As a result of our fine-tuned strategic direction as well as the operating improvements that we have made over the recent timeframe, we are now better positioned than ever to meet customers’ needs. And while we have made a
great deal of progress toward meeting new and evolving consumer needs, opportunities to improve our business remain. We believe we have the right strategy and
execution capabilities in place to do so and to capitalize

prior2ities that have been instrumen2t000al in our success over
the past two years:
• Driving productive sales growth;
• Increasing gross margin;
• Leveraging process improvements and information
technology to reduce costs; and
• Strengthening and expanding Dollar General’s culture
of serving others.
We are very excited about the future of Dollar General, as we believe that we have significant opportunities for stable and consistent growth going forward. Notably, we believe that we still have significant store growth potential and are accelerating new stores, relocations and remodels in 2010. Importantly, we occupy an ideal position in the marketplace that we expect will continue to make us a compelling investment proposition going forward.
I am confident about the prospects for Dollar General in 2010, and I think it is fair to say that in some ways the Dollar General story is just beginning. We have tremendous opportunities in front of us and will pursue these opportuni- ties with every available resource.
We are grateful for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders, and we want to thank all of you for your support. As Dollar General embarks on its first full year as a public company, there is much to look forward to, and we are excited about continuing the journey with you.
Sincerely,
Richard W. Dreiling
