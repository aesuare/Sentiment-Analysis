 TO OUR
 Two years ago, we started a process of changing Sonoco for the better. These changes are providing us better opportunities to grow through new products, new markets, new customers, new services and new ways of thinking. Our process of change is also creating an environment that allows
us to better harness the power of our portfolio and our people to optimize business performance.
Our efforts to change for the better resulted in record sales in 2014, topping $5 billion for the first time in our 115-year history. To further spur growth, we com- pleted the second largest acquisition in our history, purchasing the Weidenhammer Packaging Group for $355 million, significantly expanding Sonoco’s posi- tion in the European composite can market.
Overall, our two-year efforts to Grow and Optimize have allowed Sonoco to provide a two-year total return to shareholders of 56.8% (including an 8% return in 2014), compared with the S&P 500’s two- year total return performance of 50.2%, which our market capitalization has grown to greater than $4.5 billion.
2014 Results
Consolidated net sales for 2014 were $5.02 billion,
a $155 million, or 3.2% increase from 2013. The increase in sales was mostly due to net sales additions from acquisitions of $100 million, while volume
grew sales by 2% or about $87 million. These gains were partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange of approximately $59 million. Total domestic sales were $3.3 million, up 1.7% from 2013 levels, while international sales were $1.7 billion, up 6.2% from 2013 with most of the increase coming in Europe which was largely driven by Weidenhammer acquisition.
Net income attributable to Sonoco was $225.9 mil- lion, or $2.19 per diluted share, compared with $209.8 million, or $2.03 per diluted share, for 2013.

Earnings in 2014 were negatively impacted by after- tax charge of $22.7 million consisting of restructuring costs, asset impairment charges, acquisitions expenses, and acquisition inventory step-up costs, partially offset by excess property insurance proceeds.
Base earnings in 2014 were $248.6 million, or $2.41 per diluted share, compared with $228.2 million or $2.21 per diluted share in 2013. This 8.9% increase
in base earnings was the result of manufacturing pro- ductivity improvements, a positive price/cost relation- ship, volume growth, proceeds from a legal settle- ment, acquisitions and lower pension expense.

improvements, a positive price/cost relationship, volume growth, proceeds from a legal settlement, acquisitions and lower pension expense. These favorable factors were partially offset by higher labor, maintenance, management incentive and other operating costs.
Our balanced portfolio performed well as our two largest segments—Consumer Packaging and Paper and Industrial Converted Products—each achieved record base operating results. Consumer Packaging’s operating profit increased 6.6% to $199.4 million, and operating margins grew to 10.2%, while Paper and Industrial Converted Products’ operating profit grew 17.5% to $162.3 million, supporting an 8.5% margin. Our Display and Packaging segment grew operating profit by 21.5% to $25.3 million, while our Protective Solutions segment reported a 15% decline in opera-ting profit to $34.0 million, following a difficult first quarter which was impacted by severe winter weather.
flow were lower in 2014 as higher GAAP net income was more than offset by normal working capital changes and higher income tax payments and pension contributions. In addition, 2014 cash flow was negatively impacted by the funding of a proposed $14.7 million settlement of environmental claims and litigation associated with Fox River. Pension and post- retirement plan contributions were $66 million in 2014, compared with $42 million in 2013. Net capital expenditures and cash dividends were $169 million and $129 million, respectively, during 2014, compared with $168 million and $125 million, respectively, in 2013. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations minus net capital expenditures and cash dividends) for 2014 was $120 million, compared with $245 million for 2013.
In 2014, the Company repurchased approximately
2 million shares of common stock for $82 million and expended a total $334 million, excluding assumed liabilities, for the acquisitions of Weidenhammer and a small tube and core business.
At year end, total debt was approximately $1.3 billion, compared with $981 million at the end of 2013, due entirely to acquisitions. The Company’s debt-to-capital ratio was 45.1% at year-end 2014, compared with 36.3% at the end of 2013. Cash and cash equivalents were $161 million at year-end 2014, compared with $218 million at the end of 2013. Despite higher debt, the Company maintains an investment grade debt rating of BBB+ as established by Standard and Poor’s.

Grow and Optimize
Our Grow and Optimize strategy is the centerpiece of our efforts to “Re-envision Sonoco.” Our vision is to become a world-class company by preserving the best parts of our significant legacy and introducing new ideas, new processes and new ways of thinking to ensure we have a bright, sustainable future.
Our re-envisioning involves a three-step process
to boost performance, including re-imagining our culture, re-aligning our structure and re-engineer- ing our operations. We made solid progress in re-imagining our culture to drive growth through the implementation of our i6 Innovation ProcessTM. This process is focused on developing new products and services for our customers to drive organic growth and to achieve our goal of becoming a solutions company that just happens to offer packaging versus a packaging company that offers multiple solutions.
We believe one of the leading indicators for innovation and growth is the number of Record of Innovations (ROIs) and Patent Applications leading to new product development. Since standardizing our front-end

process to encourage purpose-driven innovation through the i6 process, Sonoco experienced a record 33% increase in ROIs and a 25% increase in U.S. patent applications in 2014, compared with the prior three-year average.
To further spur growth, Sonoco successfully completed the acquisition of Weidenhammer on October 31, 2014, thus creating a global leader in rigid paper packaging. This strategic acquisition expands Sonoco’s global consumer-related sales to approximately 55% of the Company’s combined annual turnover, while increasing the combined net sales in Europe to around 20% of our global sales. In addition to producing composite cans, drums and luxury tubes, Weidenhammer produces unique rigid plastic containers using state-of-the-art thin-walled injection molding technology with modern in-mold labeling. Read more about Weidenhammer on pages 10 and 11.
In addition to changing our culture to drive growth, we are beginning to implement a series of actions focused on streamlining our structure, optimizing our supply chain, improving productivity and perfecting our cost competitiveness to enhance margins and returns. These efforts will continue throughout 2015, and we firmly believe that a flatter, more focused, more empowered organization will make us more competitive and more responsive to changing market conditions and our customers’ needs. We believe this will ultimately allow us to continue to return exponential value to shareholders, to customers and to our associates.

   2015 Outlook
We are optimistic entering 2015 that the U.S. economy should continue to steadily improve, and international markets should rebound. We remain committed to our Grow and Optimize strategy. For 2015, this includes achieving higher than market average organic growth, improving operating margins, successfully integrating Weidenhammer, maximizing cash flow and optimizing our global portfolio through simplification and improved efficiency.
That said, our outlook for 2015 projects headwinds from higher pension and post-retirement benefit costs and a continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which, if realized, will create pressure on top-line growth and reported earnings.
Finally, we will continue to balance capital deployment between growing our business and returning cash to shareholders. Sonoco has returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases over the past decade, including $217 million in 2014. Sonoco has paid
cash dividends for nearly 90 consecutive years, while increasing payouts for 32 years straight. We are committed to extending this streak.
Nearly 115 years ago, our founder, Major James Lide Coker, was quoted as saying, “Change is an immutable law; external adaptation is the price of survival.”
I certainly agree with him that change is inevitable
in today’s world. However, we believe with change comes opportunity. The markets we serve are constantly changing as consumer needs evolve, leading to varying demands of our customers. But we firmly believe that opportunity exists for Sonoco if we maintain a strong vision, embrace innovation and deliver exceptional value to our customers.
In closing, I want to extend my personal thanks to our 20,800 associates around the world for their commitment, contribution and support. They are the

future of Sonoco and supply the much- needed energy, ideas and innovation to keep us on our new path.
We thank you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your investment.
