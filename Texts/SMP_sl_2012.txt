To Our Shareholders,
2012 was an excellent year. For the second year in a row, we set records for sales, profit, and cash flow. Sales grew 8.5% to $948.9 million; earnings from continuing operations, excluding non-recurring items, increased 17.2% to $42.3 million; and cash flow from operations reached $93.6 million.
Some of the improvement is related to industry demographics. The age of the vehicle population continues to rise. It is now upwards of 11 years, and is expected to continue increasing in the future even as sales of new cars approach historic levels. Older cars, as we all know, need more repairs.
Recent acquisitions have also played a role in these results. In the past two years we have acquired three companies—BLD Products Engine Controls division, a former vendor of ours for various Engine Management products; Forecast Trading Corporation, a supplier of economy line Engine Management products; and CompressorWorks, a manufacturer of new air conditioning compressors.
The integration process for all three has gone well. We have maintained the customer base. We have combined and relocated—often to low cost countries— several operations. We have consolidated product lines to generate further savings. The key employees have agreed to stay with the Company. As a result, all three contributed to our 2012 results, and we are confident that they will provide important contributions in the years ahead.
Since the beginning of 2013, we have completed two additional transactions. In January we acquired a minority interest in Orange Electronic Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) sensors, located in Taiwan. An industry market research organization predicts that this product line will triple over the next five years. Orange has been our primary supplier for TPMS sensors. We are pleased that we will now have an enhanced relationship with Orange, and we look forward to working together with them in this increasingly important product category.
In February we acquired the Original Equipment business from Standard Motor Products Holdings Ltd., our former affiliate in the U.K. The business at present is relatively small, about $8 million annually, but we believe we will be in a position to grow this business. The bulk of the products are designed and manufactured in our factory in Bialystok, Poland, which offers both high technical skills and low operating costs. We will now have a more direct relationship with customers and prospects.
In sum, this makes five investments in slightly over two years. All are related to our business. All provided immediate benefits in sales and profit. All will help us grow in the future. We believe this is a good template for future acquisitions.
Aside from the acquisitions, we continue to work on reducing costs and improving margins. Our gross margin increased more than a full point for the year, from 26.2% to 27.4%. This results from our continuing efforts to increase in-house manufacturing, expand production in low cost countries and reduce purchase costs.

  We generated cash from operations of roughly $94 million. This enabled us to fund the acquisitions and still reduce year over year debt from $73 million to $41 million. At the end of 2012 our Debt:EBITDA was a healthy 0.5:1.
We are also pleased to be able to increase returns to stockholders. Effective March 1, we have increased the quarterly dividend from 9 cents to 11 cents, and we are initiating a new share buyback program for 2013 of $6 million.
However, there is one piece of sad news to report. Robert M. Gerrity, our esteemed Board member for 16 years, and Chairman of our Compensation and Management Development Committee, passed away last year. We will dearly miss his industry knowledge, his advice and most of all, his friendship. We have replaced Bob with two new members — Ms. Alisa Norris, currently the Chief Marketing Officer for R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company; and Mr. Joseph McDonnell, the Dean of the College of Management and Human Services at the University of Southern Maine. Both of our new members bring additional skills and insights and we look forward to their contributions in the years ahead.
To conclude as we began, 2012 was an excellent year. As all companies do, we face many challenges. But we believe we have the structure in place and, more important, the people, to surmount the challenges and to continue to grow and succeed.
