EXECUTING STRATEGY: growth in midstream
The rapid development of logistics infrastructure continues to facilitate the U.S. petroleum industry's resurgence, with transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products representing significant value to energy companies, consumers and investors. This creates growth opportunities where size and scale matter. We are participating in this build-out through our substantial midstream assets and general partner interest in MPLX.

per year. As the sponsor of MPLX, MPC intends to maintain a growing reserve of master limited partnership (MLP)-eligible assets. That growth of reserves will be accomplished through MPC's continued focus on midstream investments.

APPROXIMATE LIMITED PARTNER DISTRIBUTIONS: APPROXIMATE GENERAL PARTNER DISTRIBUTIONS:

Accelerating MPLX growth to benefit MPC shareholders: MPC plans to grow MPLX substantially, and we
intend to accelerate MPLX's annual distribution growth rate. As we evolve MPLX into a large-cap, diversified MLP, we will be focused on building size and scale in the partnership more rapidly in the near term. It is our intention to grow MPLX's December 2015 annualized earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to at least $450 million. This accelerated growth plan will support an average annual distribution growth rate percentage in the mid-20s over the next five years. Toward this objective, during 2014 MPC executed two drop-downs to MPLX with a combined annualized EBITDA of approximately $110 million. These drop-downs increased MPLX's interest in MPLX Pipe Line Holdings LP to 99.5 percent, from the 56 percent interest MPLX held at year-end 2013.

We have identified additional MLP-eligible sources of midstream EBITDA worth approximately $1.6 billion. These EBITDA sources include crude oil and refined product pipelines, marine assets such as barges and towboats, light-product and asphalt terminals, railcars, storage tanks, fuel distribution volumes, condensate splitters and more. As MPC shareholders, we anticipate you will benefit from MPC's general partner interest in MPLX, as well as from incentive distribution rights and the potential for proceeds from asset sales we may make to MPLX. We expect to receive over $550 million of distributions by 2019 based on the average mid-20s percent distribution growth rates for the next five years. The amount of value MPLX contributes to your MPC shares is significant, and we believe the market will increasingly reflect this value over time. It is important to note that although MPLX's growth initially will be driven by drop-downs of MLP-eligible assets from MPC or acquisitions from third parties, organic projects will also

Retail acquisition's impact on midstream: In addition
to greatly expanding MPC's retail segment, the Hess acquisition has also opened up strategic options in our logistics business. We acquired allocations on various pipelines, including approximately 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) on Colonial Pipeline, giving us greater flexibility to transport refined products into Northeast markets. The acquisition also adds about 3 billion gallons of annual fuels distribution volume. When added to MPC's existing volume of approximately 17 billion gallons per year, our total is now approximately 20 billion gallons

make significant contributions. One such project is MPLX's proposed 50-mile Cornerstone Pipeline, which will transport hydrocarbon liquids from the Utica Shale region in southeastern Ohio to MPC's refinery in Canton, Ohio. The pipeline is being routed to provide the opportunity for connections to various Utica Shale condensate stabilization, fractionator and cryogenic facilities, along with potential future gathering and storage facilities. A non-binding open season for the project was completed in the third quarter, and a binding open season began on Feb. 9, 2015. MPLX is also advancing various proposed Utica build-out projects to provide service to additional markets beyond Canton, including new construction and utilization of existing pipelines. These projects would connect many Midwest refineries to Utica Shale production, and ultimately provide the ability to reach Chicago-area refineries, as well as pipelines that supply diluent to Western Canada.

35 percent ownership interest in Enbridge Inc.'s Southern Access Extension Pipeline Project. MPC has also agreed to be the anchor shipper on Southern Access Extension, which will have the capacity to transport 300,000 bpd of crude oil from Flanagan, Ill., to the crude oil storage hub at Patoka, Ill. The line is expected to begin service in late 2015. MPC's increased stake in Southern Access Extension, along with our investment in Enbridge's Sandpiper Pipeline from North Dakota to Superior, Wis., will increase takeaway capacity from the prolific Bakken Shale play in North Dakota, and position us to meaningfully participate in systems that will increase our ­ and other refiners' ­ access to affordable crude oil supplies and reduce crude oil transportation costs out of this important region. Similarly, as liquids production from the Utica Shale region in eastern Ohio grows, we are investing in midstream assets that enable us to leverage the geographic proximity of our refineries in Canton and Catlettsburg, Ky., to this feedstock source. During the fourth quarter, we completed construction of a 25,000 bpd condensate splitter at

our refinery in Canton, and a 35,000 bpd splitter at Catlettsburg is slated for completion during the second quarter of 2015. We also expanded our crude oil trucking operations, as well as the truck unloading capacity at our Canton refinery and a truck-to-barge facility on the Ohio River in Wellsville, Ohio, to accommodate Utica liquids production. In addition to these crude oil investments, MPC also acquired an additional 7 percent interest in Explorer Pipeline, which transports refined products such as gasoline, diesel, fuel oil and jet fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Midwest. This brings MPC's ownership interest in Explorer to 25 percent. In short, MPC continues to invest in, and benefit from, the synergies between our midstream and refining businesses. MPC's Midwest and Gulf Coast refining assets give us the ability to make major, multiyear commitments to move price-advantaged crude oil and refined products to the markets of highest value, while investing in projects that we anticipate will produce significant, consistent earnings and cash flow for our midstream business well into the future.

Investing in MPC's midstream growth: As part of our
strategy to continue growing our more stable cash-flow businesses, during the second quarter we exercised our option to acquire a

EXECUTING STRATEGY: enhancing refining margins
Processing light sweet crude: As
crude oil production from U.S. shale plays continues to grow, we are enhancing our ability to process light crude oil. As of year-end 2014, our seven-refinery system can process a slate of 68 percent light crude, and our refineries in Canton, Catlettsburg and Texas City are able to process 100 percent light crude. In addition to the condensate splitters at Canton and Catlettsburg, we made progress during 2014 on a debottlenecking project at our Robinson, Ill., refinery that will allow it to run 100 percent light crude oil starting in 2016.

Enhancing operational excellence at the Galveston Bay refinery: We
began 2014 by executing the largest series of planned refinery maintenance projects in our history, including the first major maintenance work at GBR since its acquisition in early 2013. Our employees and contractors across our refining system completed these turnarounds safely, quickly and efficiently, even as they contended with the effects of adverse weather at many of our facilities. During GBR's first full year as an MPC asset, the employees and management made excellent progress in moving the facility's operations toward MPC's standards. Personal safety performance continues to improve, as does environmental performance. Process-safety and environmental incidents are significantly lower than in prior years.

Growing export capacity: MPC
continued to increase exports in 2014, selling refined products into higher-value overseas markets as we optimized product placement. Our average exports in 2014 were approximately 275,000 bpd, compared to an average of 218,000 bpd in 2013. During 2014 we continued working on dock expansions at our Galveston Bay refinery (GBR) in Texas City, Texas, and at our refinery in Garyville, La., with completion targeted during 2015. We are executing these expansions, in conjunction with others, toward our objective of an export capacity of 510,000 bpd by 2018.

Capitalizing on growing diesel demand: In the U.S. and globally, diesel
demand is growing and projected to continue growing well into the future. MPC has several projects in progress and under evaluation as we position the company to meet energy consumers' diesel needs. During 2014, we completed the expansion of a hydrocracker at the Garyville refinery, and we are working on expanding one of the facility's distillate hydrotreaters, which we anticipate will be completed during the first quarter of 2015. When added to 2015 hydrocracker projects at GBR and Robinson, as well as other refinery projects, we anticipate our diesel production capacity will increase by approximately 80,000 bpd by the end of 2016, for a total of 38 percent of our total refined product yield.

Decline in crude oil costs: One of the most prominent market movements of 2014 was the rapid decline in the price of crude oil during the latter half of the year. When considering the effects of this development on MPC, it's important to keep in mind that crude oil is MPC's largest single cost of doing business. As such, the drop in the absolute price of crude oil does not negatively affect our refining segment. Our refining profitability is predicated primarily on crack spreads ­ the difference between what we pay for crude oil and the prices at which we are able to sell refined products. Crack spreads do not necessarily follow the price of oil as it fluctuates, but are more tied to consumer demand and the price differences between various grades of crude oil. And, as consumers benefit from the new, low-cost fuel environment, the likelihood is that overall demand for refined products will rise.
MPC has continued to make great strides in its strategy to grow its more stable cash-flow midstream and retail businesses, which help to mitigate the volatility that often characterizes the refining business. In an environment of changing crude oil and refined product prices, MPC's sponsored MLP and other midstream assets, along with our high-performing Speedway stores, remain a growing source of stable earnings.

MEETING CONSUMERS' ENERGY NEEDS
OUR CONTINUAL OPTIMIZATION OF MPC'S REFINING, MIDSTREAM AND RETAIL BUSINESSES ENABLES US TO MEET THE MARKET'S NEED FOR THE MANY PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE. WITH THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN U.S. CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE U.S. OIL INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED A REMARKABLE RESURGENCE. AS A RESULT, U.S. REFINERS HAVE HAD GROWING ACCESS TO LIGHT SWEET CRUDE OIL FROM U.S. SHALE PLAYS, AND CONSUMERS HAVE BENEFITED FROM PLENTIFUL, RELIABLE SUPPLIES OF FUEL. U.S. REFINERS, INCLUDING MPC, HAVE KEPT PACE WITH THIS DOMESTIC PRODUCTION, AND ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROCESS U.S. CRUDE OIL FOR YEARS TO COME.

MPC is an industry leader in energy efficiency, having earned

30 of the 39 EPA ENERGY STAR recognitions awarded to refineries

77%

MPC has blended ethanol into gasoline for decades ­ since well before it was mandated by the federal government. We have equity interests in three Midwest ethanol plants. We began blending ethanol because it made economic sense for both manufacturers and consumers of fuels. As part of our efforts to continually evaluate energy efficiency measures, we have been studying the electricity production of a 6,000-panel solar array we built in Findlay, Ohio, and will be using a wind turbine to power one of our pipeline facilities. We are undertaking these projects because they have the potential to yield economically viable results that could benefit MPC and consumers through lower costs.

MPC continually researches and implements cost-effective programs, processes and technologies to improve energy efficiency. From 2002 through 2013, the last full year for which data is available, gross refinery throughputs at the six refineries we owned through that period increased by approximately 40 percent, while limiting our direct greenhouse gas emissions ­ an indicator of energy consumption ­ to only 6 percent.

Our contributions to society: There is no
energy source ­ or combination of energy sources ­ that can replace fossil fuels in the foreseeable future. Fossil fuels provide power to hospitals, schools, homes and businesses. They enable farmers to till, irrigate, plant and harvest crops to feed themselves and their communities. Reliable and affordable fuels empower people with the freedom to transport themselves to markets, schools, medical facilities and community events. Diesel and gasoline allow businesses to

Stewards of the environment
Since 2009, MPC has been an ENERGY STAR partner company under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ENERGY STAR Program. Since the program began, MPC has received 30 of the 39 recognitions awarded to U.S. refineries under this program. This represents 77 percent of such recognitions ­ a very large share, considering MPC's refineries represent less than 10 percent of the total U.S. capacity.

Alternative energy and efficiency measures:
We also invest in alternative energy sources as we seek to meet consumers' needs. MPC increased its investment in biofuels in 2014 with the purchase of a 60 million gallon-per-year biodiesel production facility in Cincinnati, Ohio. The plant, located on the Ohio River, is in proximity to MPC's Midwest assets. It produces primarily biodiesel and glycerin, and allows MPC to participate in the development of this market.

OUR INDUSTRY'S TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES have enabled us to

provide goods and services, as these fuels' affordability and reliability enhance the efficiency of every link along the value chain ­ transporting raw materials, manufacturing goods, and transporting goods to those who need them. Cold winters and hot summers are less hazardous when safe, affordable fuels allow heating and cooling systems to more effectively hold temperature extremes at bay. Recovery from natural disasters is quicker and safer with hydrocarbon-fueled ambulances, fire trucks and law-enforcement resources; as power at hospitals and markets is quickly restored with gasolineand diesel-powered generators; as food, medical supplies and construction materials arrive in trucks, aircraft and marine vessels powered by hydrocarbon fuels. In addition, the mobility that fossil fuels provide ­ by air, road, rail, river and ocean ­ has unlocked unprecedented prosperity around the world. In an effort to address the possibility of weather-related problems in the future, there is an activist community that urges investors to remove their investment dollars from companies that provide this indispensable form of energy to billions of people worldwide. In their zeal, advocates of fossil-fuel divestment are ignoring the immediate threats to health and well-being faced by the world's

most vulnerable; for people who don't have access to the benefits afforded by plentiful, reliable fossil fuels, access to energy is a real, daily concern. Enormous improvements in the quality of life for hundreds of millions of our fellow human beings can be provided by affordable fuels technologies that exist today and have been proven effective for more than a century. Our industry's technological advances have enabled us to provide increasing amounts of energy to consumers around the world while continually reducing our environmental footprint. We all share the same land, air and water, and MPC is committed to providing

the energy that billions of people rely on, while we also serve as responsible stewards of the environment. While solar, wind and other alternative power sources can play a role in providing the energy needed by billions of people around the world, only fossil fuels can meet the challenge efficiently, and on the scale that is needed. This will remain the case for the foreseeable future. As president and CEO of your company, I am proud of our role in manufacturing, transporting and marketing fuels and other products that millions of people use to make their lives better every day. I am also grateful to you for your investment in this critical work. Our management team and employees stand ready to perform as safely and efficiently as possible, and we look forward to continuing to share our prosperity with you. Sincerely,
