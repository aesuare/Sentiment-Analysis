T HOUSANDS of PEOPLE on the ROAD to M ILWAUKEE SPEAK VOLUMES about WHERE WE are COMING from... and WHERE WE are HEADED

D E A R F E L L OW S H A R E H O L D E R S :

Riders from all walks of life made the journey of a lifetime to be a part of the Harley-Davidson 100th Anniversary celebration last August.They came from every state in the union and from around the globe, on every kind of Harley-Davidson motorcycle imaginable. And they carried with them a special excitement--and a sense that this anniversary ride and celebration were more about witnessing the birth of the next 100 years than dwelling in the past.They knew that they were making history, not just reliving it.
®

And what an anniversary year it was! From the enthusiasm and emotion of those who came to celebrate, to another year of record performance, 2003 demonstrated how our long-range plan to grow value and to strengthen the brand adds up to an unparalleled experience for riders and an outstanding opportunity for investors. By the time our anniversary celebration came to a close, more than one million people had attended a 100th Anniversary event somewhere around the globe. Add to the mix the introduction of our re-engineered

Sportster® motorcycle line, the startup of our new Softail® motorcycle plant in Pennsylvania, and the expansion of the Willie G. Davidson Product Development Center in Wisconsin, and you begin to get the picture of the dynamics in constant motion at HarleyDavidson to create and to fulfill demand. In 2003, Harley-Davidson, Inc. recorded its 18th consecutive year of record revenue and earnings. Consolidated revenue for the Company was $4.62 billion, a 13% increase over 2002, while net income was $760.9 million, a 31.1% increase over the prior year.

Diluted earnings per share rose to $2.50, a 31.6% increase over 2002. The Company shipped 291,147 HarleyDavidson motorcycles in 2003, a 10.4% increase over 2002 and nearly double the 150,818 motorcycles produced just five years ago during our 95th anniversary year. Retail sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles for 2003 grew 8.8% in the United States, 11.8% in Europe and 8.3% in Japan, outpacing the heavyweight motorcycle industry in those markets. Parts & Accessories revenue increased 13.3% to $712.8 million in 2003. Revenue for General Merchandise, which consists

initial public stock offering in 1986 is the result of a combination of factors. These include our ability to deliver new products to market, attract new customers, retain existing ones and expand capacity in a responsible way. Unique marketplace events also created special growth opportunities for Harley-Davidson. The common thread in our performance is consumer demand, how we create it and how we satisfy it. Going forward, Harley-Davidson has established a goal to create and fulfill the demand for at least 400,000 motorcycles in 2007. Let me share with you how we set this goal.

be attributed to some special circumstances. These include the stock market bubble (and the associated "wealth effect") that occurred during the second half of the 1990s and the excitement, during the past three years, leading up to our 100 th Anniversary celebration. Going forward, we believe we will see a return to a more normal 7% to 9% growth rate, assuming an economy that is not overly hot or cold, and absent unusual marketplace conditions. That rate of growth takes us to approximately 400,000 motorcycles in 2007. We believe this is a reasonable expectation of growth for the foreseeable future,

of which are experiencing the benefits of our large (and growing) base of customers. At the heart of driving our growth, of course, are our employees, who remain our most important asset and hold the key to our future. I'm proud to say that for the sixth time in seven years, Harley-Davidson made Fortune magazine's annual list of the "100 Best Companies to Work For " -- based largely on Fortune's research, which included employee responses to surveys. At the senior leadership level, we enhanced the team in three important areas in 2003. Twenty-nine-year company veteran Louis Netz was promoted to Vice

of MotorClothesTM apparel and collectibles, totaled $211.4 million. Excluding 100th Anniversary merchandise from the mix in both 2002 and 2003, General Merchandise revenue grew 12.7% year-over-year. Harley-Davidson Financial Services, Inc. (hdfs) recorded impressive gains in 2003. Operating income increased 61.1% to $167.9 million, reflecting both the quality of HDFS' product offerings and the ability of HDFS to move assertively and capitalize on strong motorcycle demand. In 2003, hdfs made $1.9 billion in retail loans on more than 125,000 motorcycles. Normally in my letter to shareholders, I would highlight the initiatives that produced these results. However, as HarleyDavidson sets out on its second century in business, I'd prefer to focus on the road ahead. Eighteen consecutive years of record performance don't just happen. HarleyDavidson's performance since the Company's

As we look back over our past 18 years in business as a public company, we have grown our motorcycle unit sales from 36,735 motorcycles in 1986 to 291,147 motorcycles in 2003. This is equivalent to an annual compound growth rate of 12.9%. In analyzing the marketplace over this time period, we believe that there was an underlying "core" growth rate for Harley-Davidson motorcycle sales estimated to be in the range of 7% ­ 9% per year.This core growth rate was driven by factors such as the growing acceptance of motorcycling as a "socially acceptable" sport, the trend for people of all ages to engage in more active lifestyles and the unique appeal of Harley-Davidson motorcycles and the Harley-Davidson motorcycling experience. We believe that the difference between the core growth rate and the generally higher actual growth rates that prevailed from year to year throughout this period can

based on our great lineup of exciting products, the planned pace of new product introductions, our effectiveness in adding new dimensions to the total ownership experience, the continued development of dealer capabilities and the positive impact that our added capacity is having on the supply-demand imbalance. For a change, there are new motorcycles to be seen and touched on some dealership floors, and prices are moving back toward the published Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price -- making our motorcycles more affordable. Even as unit growth returns to a more normal growth rate, we believe we can sustain earnings growth rates in the midteens. We intend to achieve this through ongoing productivity improvements in all areas of the business and earnings contributions from Parts & Accessories, General Merchandise, and Financial Services -- all

President -Director of Styling, in recognition of his contributions -- in collaboration with Willie G. Davidson -- to the look and character of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Willie G., who is now Senior Vice President and Chief Styling Officer, will continue to provide leadership in this critical function. In the supply chain management arena, Matt Levatich was promoted to Vice President Materials Management. During his nine years with the Company, Matt has demonstrated versatility and a keen sense of what it takes to be an effective leader. In response to the dramatic growth of our business in the last few years and to uphold the rigorous level of financial oversight which we insist on, we reorganized the Finance department at the senior level by dividing the duties of Controller and Treasurer. John Olin joined HarleyDavidson in May as Vice President,

Controller, responsible for financial planning, cost control and security. Jim Brostowitz now serves as Vice President, Treasurer, responsible for external financial reporting, treasury, tax planning and risk management. Harley-Davidson is fortunate to have two such talented individuals in these key positions. Our track record for working cooperatively with our union partners also yielded results. In 2003, the Company and its Milwaukee unions agreed to a plan that keeps the manufacture of transmission components in-house and provides some limits on the Company's retirement health care costs. Over the next few years, we will be making the largest single investment ever in our Milwaukee-area powertrain operations as a result of those decisions. I want to thank all the members of the Harley-Davidson family -- our customers, our investors, our employees and suppliers, the communities in which we do business and our dealers -- for making HarleyDavidson the great company that it is. I consider myself very fortunate to be in this company at this time, helping to guide Harley-Davidson into the future. Heading into our second century, we have an outstanding team and a solid road map in place -- Harley-Davidson's Strategic Plan for Sustainable Growth -- with its fundamental objectives to: 1. Grow Value; and 2. Strengthen the Brand. Behind that seeming simplicity lies the engine that drives everything we do. As a robust, living document, the Plan establishes goals and strategies along a rolling 10-year horizon to attract new customers, to fulfill their dreams for high quality products and memorable experiences, and to continually improve processes, efficiency and productivity at every level. And our

shareholders can take comfort in the knowledge that all of us at Harley-Davidson are dedicated to achieving these goals. With a solid balance sheet, a return on equity of greater than 20% for the last 18 years, demonstrated cash-generating ability, state-of-the-art factories, a steady stream of new products and services, our strong brand and the prospects of sustainable mid-teen annual earnings growth, Harley-Davidson is a great investment now and for the future. I invite you to learn more about what Harley-Davidson means by "Grow Value" and "Strengthen the Brand" in the pages that follow.
