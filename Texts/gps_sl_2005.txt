 letter from the chairman
        Robert J. Fisher
Chairman
Fiscal 2005 was a year of progress as well as challenges.
During a year where we had disappointing top line results, we still delivered solid earnings and focused on creating value for our shareholders by repurchas- ing 99 million shares for $2 billion and doubling our dividend. We continued to improve our financial strength and ended the year with $3 billion of cash and investments. And we made notable progress against our longer term growth initiatives, including the launch of Forth & Towne and the development of an entirely new e-commerce platform.
We fully recognize, however, that our long-term success depends on growing our top line. Gap Inc.’s Board of Directors is highly
perspective and as the governing body of this com- pany. We are a diverse group with experience that spans disciplines, industries and geographies. Even with such varied experiences, I believe the Board works well together—and is asking the tough ques- tions necessary to challenge and guide management in the best interest of our shareholders.
In 2005, the Board maintained its commitment to continually evolve and adopt appropriate governance best practices. For example, we adopted a majority vote guideline for director elections—and we continued our proactive approach to be transparent in compensation disclosure. In addition to providing a director compensation table, we are including a CEO tally sheet in this years’ proxy statement. We have also approved an improved pay-for-performance bo- nus structure for executives across the organization.
I’d like to personally thank the Board for its ongoing contributions and commitment. More detail on Gap Inc.’s Board of Directors is available on page 62.
My experience at Gap Inc. now spans more than two decades and I’ve seen many ups and downs in the business. Clearly, it is more rewarding for our shareholders when the product offering is resonat- ing with customers. The Board and I feel strongly that Gap Inc. has the leadership, talent, systems
and financial strength to return to our position as a leader in providing customers with the product and experience they expect from our brands. This will be the key to re-establishing top line growth and driving long-term shareholder value.

 letter to shareholders
 None of us is satisfied with our overall 2005 business performance—we know we can do better. Building on our foundation of iconic brands, strong balance sheet, solid operations and talented people, we are aggressively taking actions to win back the customers we’ve disappointed.
Despite disappointing top line results, we have continued to focus on creating value for our share- holders. In 2005, we generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow,*enabling us to complete a $2 billion share repurchase program and double our dividend to 18 cents per share. Reflecting our ongoing con- fidence in generating strong cash flow, we plan to continue our share repurchase program and increase our dividend to 32 cents per share in 2006.
Building a strong platform for growth
Just five years ago, Gap Inc. faced one of the most challenging periods in its history. Over the past three years, I’m proud that we have set the company on
a course for sustainable, long-term health.
*See the reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to a GAAP measure in the table on page 13.
We strengthened our balance sheet, eliminating $2.9 billion in debt since 2002 and ending 2005 with $3 billion in cash and investments. We improved
our operations by developing stronger relationships with sourcing vendors; building a consumer insights capability; optimizing our store fleets; and incorporat- ing more disciplined inventory management.
In 2005, we continued to build on these operational improvements, reducing our sourcing vendor base by 10 percent; creating a new customer experience survey for all brands; closing more than 100 under- performing Gap stores; and allocating Gap and Old Navy’s product sizes based on each store’s unique selling history.

   Most notably, this past year we built completely
new online systems, resulting in what The New York Times reported are among the best e-commerce sites in retail. And we continue to receive feedback from customers that these changes have significantly improved their online shopping experience.
These operational improvements have built a strong foundation for our long-term growth strategies.
And in 2005, we made great progress on key growth initiatives.
First, Gap Inc.’s square footage increased 3 percent in 2005, driven by store growth at Old Navy. We will continue to open new Old Navy stores in 2006.
Second, we expanded our brands internationally, opening an additional 13 Gap stores and introducing Banana Republic in Japan. To help us become more relevant to customers in each market, we built local merchandising and marketing teams, as well as a dedicated international design team. We also developed an international franchising capability, allowing our brands to enter smaller, more fragmented markets. Our first agreements include planned expan- sion to Singapore and Malaysia beginning in 2006.
Finally, we successfully launched our fourth brand, Forth & Towne, in Chicago and New York, filling a need in the marketplace to better serve boomer women. We’ve received consistent feedback from customers thanking us for the exceptional service,
dependable fits and great style. We look forward to bringing Forth & Towne to four to five additional U.S. markets in 2006.
While we are proud of these accomplishments, we were disappointed with our 2 percent decline in net sales and 5 percent decline in comparable store sales in 2005. Reflecting on the past several quarters, as we made necessary shifts to ensure the company’s long-term success, at times this created short-term distractions for our teams. Today our teams under- stand that, most importantly, we must offer inspiring product.
Reconnecting with our customers
Our iconic brands continue to be our greatest assets. Women’s Wear Daily named Old Navy and Gap the most recognizable brands in sportswear in 2005. We’ve built a tremendous loyalty with our customers, which has helped us weather the ups and downs inherent in the fashion industry. To win back the customers we’ve disappointed, we will deliver
great product, supported by effective marketing and compelling store experiences.
Gap is focused on re-establishing the brand’s iconic positioning. Our product design is true to Gap’s heritage and will help us regain our authority in key categories. We developed a new store design to improve the customer experience, and began rolling it out across the fleet.

   And, most importantly, we put strong leaders in place to drive Gap’s turnaround. In 2006, the team is focused on creating quality product faster, upgrading the environment of our top 200 adult stores, and developing inventive marketing to create buzz that Gap is back.
Banana Republic’s affordable luxury positioning clearly differentiates the brand
in the market. Our customers expect to find their wardrobe essentials at Banana Republic; so in 2006, we are emphasizing key items and more approachable fashion in our product assortments. We are also evolving our marketing to better reflect this focus. The launch of Banana Republic’s high-quality handbag collection has been very successful, and is an example of how we’ll continue to extend the brand. In 2006, we look forward to introducing a personal care line through an exclusive partnership with Inter Parfums, Inc.
             Ultimately, it’s the passion and commitment of our people that will drive our results and help us realize our long-term vision.
At Old Navy, value remains an important part of the brand proposition, but our customers also expect to find special, trend-right product. Delivering on this proposition requires that we develop product in a shorter time frame so we can quickly react to customer response and market trends. Now that Old Navy’s designers are based in San Francisco, they’re working more dynamically with the merchandising and production teams on a daily basis. And they’re traveling to factories to make decisions more quickly and gain visibility to new innovations. To better showcase Old Navy’s specialty
         product, in 2006 we will be upgrading our stores’ visual merchandising, supported by the kind of creative marketing that helped make the brand famous.
Investing in our people and our communities
We remain committed to attracting, developing and retaining top talent in our industry. In 2005, we launched a new executive development program and we are also investing in leadership training for new managers. We have re-organized some of our teams to support more effective ways of working. In some cases, this has required bringing in new leaders who have the unique abilities to drive our turnaround, reinvigorate the creative spirit of our brands and harness the ideas of our teams. Our people always have been and will continue to be the heart of our company.

   Our more than 150,000 employees around the world share common values, including a commitment to giving back to our communities. Gap Inc. employees volunteered nearly 155,000 hours last year to benefit charitable causes. Following the devastating hurricanes along the U.S. Gulf Coast, the company and our employees committed more than $5 million to relief efforts. This included
Old Navy’s shopping spree events, which helped nearly 15,000 kids who were displaced in the disaster replace some of what they lost.
The elimination of trade quotas in 2005 created a dramatic shift in our industry, as retailers now have the opportunity to consolidate their sourcing base. We are collaborating with other stakeholders to help manage the impact of this shift on economically challenged regions.
We will continue to support global efforts that promote economic development, improve factory conditions and help ensure healthy communities where we do business.
Driving our turnaround and realizing our vision
While 2005 was a challenging year, we are energized by the fact that the issues we face today are fixable. We know what needs to be done to be successful, and our teams are taking actions to improve. When our strategies take hold, we will gain tremendous leverage from the strong foundation we’ve built.
Supporting our vision to be the global leader in specialty apparel retailing, we will continue to reach new customers through our growth strategies:
• First, building and growing our lifestyle brands through real estate expansion and brand extensions;
• Second, expanding our brands internationally, exploring opportunities in China, and pursuing franchising in smaller, more fragmented markets;
• Third, building our online business; • And, finally, creating new brands.
Ultimately, it’s the passion and commitment of our people that will drive our results and help us realize our long-term vision. In a lot of ways, the shifts we’re making today feel very natural for us: creating compelling stories through product and store experi- ences is the essence of our DNA. Gap Inc.’s culture is creative and fast-paced, rooted in a willingness to drive change quickly. We’re all here today because we believe in the power of our brands and the future of our company.
I’m confident that our ongoing commitment to improving our core businesses, building our operating capabilities and pursuing our growth strategies will create long-term value for our shareholders.
