CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
TO OUR SNAP-ON SHAREHOLDERS
Our 2011 performance once again demonstrated the continued advancements we are making along our runways for coherent growth — those strategic areas of importance we’ve identified as being decisive to our future.
Snap-on rated overall
best brand in key categories
Snap-on was again rated most preferred brand by U.S. automotive technicians in all major categories of the 2011 Frost & Sullivan survey and set a service technician preference record in three of those categories.
For the year, net sales of $2.85 billion increased 9.0% compared to 2010. As a percentage of sales,
operating earnings before financial services improved 140 basis points to 13.5% from 12.1% a year ago. Consolidated operating earnings, which include earnings from financial services, totaled $475.1 million, an increase of 43.4% from 2010 levels. Net earnings for the year totaled $276.3
million, or $4.71 per diluted share. Excluding an $18.0 million pretax settlement gain (or $0.19 per
diluted share), net earnings of $4.52 per share increased 41.7% from $3.19 in 2010.
We believe our positive results not only confirm progress along our runways for coherent growth but also underscore how our commitment to the
Snap-on Value Creation Processes has enabled us to further navigate our runways for ongoing
improvement in the areas of safety, quality,

  customer connection, innovation and rapid continuous improvement (RCI).
Our commitment to non-negotiable workplace safety was again demonstrated by historically low safety incidence rates, and our dedication to uncompromising quality was probably best evidenced by Snap-on’s recognition in Frost & Sullivan’s 2011 survey of U.S. automotive technicians as the overall best brand, by wide margins, in hand tools, tool storage, diagnostics, power tools and pneumatic/air tools. This strong endorsement also reflects our continuing progress in connecting with customers and translating that unique insight into winning innovation. In 2011, we were pleased to receive two MOTOR Magazine Top 20 Tool Awards and four Professional Tool & Equipment News (PTEN) Innovation Awards. In addition, the number of new products launched with initial sales exceeding $1.0 million increased again this year. And, the benefits
of our disciplined approach to RCI were illustrated by the fact that, while net sales in 2011 returned to pre-recession levels last seen in 2008, operating earnings margin before financial services improved 120 basis points between these two periods.

Snap-on’s day-to-day and face-to-face direct contact with professionals in their workplaces represents a unique opportunity to learn what our customers want and need...something that we believe provides us with an important strategic advantage. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Nick Pinchuk and this vehicle repair shop manager discuss how Snap-on’s John Bean V3D2 X-Cel Wheel Alignment System’s speed, accuracy and ease of use translate to increased productivity for his shop. Joining Nick are Ron Swayne, Senior Project Engineer, Snap-on Equipment, and Jenny Gussarson, Business Development Officer, Snap-on Credit.
    
                                                                                                We’re very pleased with the progress we have made in each of these areas. We also firmly believe that, through ongoing commitment to, and application of, our Snap-on Value Creation Processes, we can continue to drive further results.
The Snap-on® brand conveys a badge of professionalism, delivering confidence to those where second best is not an option. Beginning with the development of the original Snap-on interchangeable socket set in 1920, we have enjoyed a rich history of providing repeatability and reliability in the automotive repair arena. In recent years, we’ve defined our value proposition more broadly, extending our reach beyond the garage. Today, Snap-on delivers a broad array of unique productivity solutions that make work easier for serious professionals performing critical tasks in a variety of places, both inside and outside the garage...wherever and whenever the cost and penalties for failure can be high.
In 2011, we continued to invest in important strategic growth initiatives aimed at enhancing our mobile distribution network, expanding in the vehicle repair garage, extending in critical industries and building
in emerging markets. This coherent growth strategy is aimed at developing and expanding our professional customer base, extending our value proposition to reach many more. We’ve embarked firmly on a path that we believe will continue this progress for some time to come. To this end, we’re organized to serve our primary customer groups as we execute on these strategic priorities.
The Snap-on Tools Group represents our worldwide franchised mobile tool distribution business, whose primary customers are vehicle repair technicians. In 2011, net sales of $1.15 billion represented an increase of 10.9% year over year, and the operating earnings margin of 13.7% improved 270 basis points from 11.0% in 2010. In addition to strong financial performance, metrics we monitor
to gauge the commercial health of our franchisees’ businesses continued to trend very positively. Beyond the numbers, I can say from personal experience, as I meet and speak with our franchisees, that their confidence and enthusiasm is high. We believe our strong brand, capable franchisees, premium products, network coverage and financing programs afford us significant advantages in serving vehicle repair technicians. In 2011, we received external validation on the strength of the Snap-on

Continuing to expand its presence in Asia-Pacific, Snap-on recently opened this modern engineering and R&D center in Kunshan, China. Equipped with an engineering workshop, test laboratory and vehicle garage, the new center will accommodate over 150 engineers developing undercar equipment, power tools and diagnostics products for this increasingly important and growing region.
    
                                                                                             franchise proposition. We were ranked sixth among 5,000 global franchises by Franchise Direct, a leading source of information for franchise business opportunities, in its annual Global Franchises report.
Through franchisee productivity and other initiatives,
we continue to identify opportunities that drive improvements in important operating areas including customer coverage and delivery performance. We believe these efforts, coupled with ongoing investments in
new product innovation, manufacturing and supply chain initiatives, will enable us and our franchisees to serve more customers more effectively, more profitably and with increased satisfaction.
As we look back on our progress in 2011, we again thank our dedicated franchisees and their families for their ongoing commitment and passion for Snap-on.
Net sales for the Repair Systems & Information Group (RS&I) in 2011 totaled $920.6 million, representing an increase of 8.7% from 2010. The operating earnings margin of 20.1% improved 70 basis points year over year. We achieved higher sales of equipment, diagnostics and repair information products to repair shop owners and
managers, as well as higher essential tool and facilitation program sales to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) dealerships. Innovation, which helped drive sales gains, included the development and launch of new equipment, diagnostics and information products, along with the continued expansion of functionality and content within existing RS&I solutions. For example, in 2011, we launched a new full-function diagnostics unit, the SOLUS Ultra®, which again raised industry handheld standards with productivity-enhancing features that include a larger color touch-screen, a faster boot-up and easier connections to the vehicle.
In terms of reach, we continue to make advancements in end markets adjacent to automotive repair. We’ve been expanding our position in the medium and heavy duty truck segment with handheld and PC-based diagnostics and repair information products for this attractive market. In addition, we’ve also been expanding the reach of our parts solutions products. For the RS&I Group,
we believe that leveraging strengths, including our technology leadership, broad and deep vehicle systems coverage and global capabilities, will be key drivers for success as we move forward.

   Our Commercial & Industrial Group (C&I) increased net sales by 7.4% year over year to $1.13 billion and the operating earnings margin was 11.0%. We realized solid gains in sales to a wide range of customers in a variety of critical industries and emerging markets that enabled us to more than overcome specific external headwinds related to lower sales to the military and weakness in Europe, particularly in the southern regions. Throughout the year, we continued to develop and execute on strategies to further penetrate critical industries. We expanded our offerings for customers in the aviation and aerospace sector, showcasing our broad array of solutions with
our mobile Advanced Technology Labs. These vehicles visit assembly plants, hangars and maintenance and repair (MRO) facilities to demonstrate our products, hands-on, right in the workplace,
originated by SOC. For the full year, the Financial Services segment generated revenues of $124.3 million, compared to $62.3 million in 2010, and loan originations of $606.1 million represented a 12.6% increase year over year. Full year 2011 operating earnings of $90.9 million (including an $18.0 million arbitration settlement gain) increased $76.5 million from $14.4 million last year. Financial Services plays a significant strategic role for the corporation by delivering financing options that both support efforts
to expand market coverage and penetration and attract and sustain profitable franchisees.
Snap-on’s dividend is an essential part of our capital allocation strategy, as demonstrated by our payment of consecutive quarterly cash dividends, without interruption
helping further our growth. This is just one example of our numerous initiatives in industries where mission- critical repairs and activities require Snap-on’s quality, repeatability and reliability.
In Asia-Pacific, 2011 marked
significant progress with the
opening of a new state-of-the-
art engineering and R&D facility
at our complex in Kunshan, China. This facility will support a wide range of products tailored to local markets and help continue our growth in this important region. We also launched a number of new product line expansions including new undercar equipment, a line of automotive repair hand tools under the Blue-Point® brand and the next generation of our handheld diagnostics unit aimed at the Asian market, with expanded vehicle and systems coverage.
For our Financial Services segment, the transition of Snap-on Credit (SOC) from a joint venture to a wholly- owned subsidiary continued to progress seamlessly and as planned. During the year, Snap-on steadily grew its on-book finance portfolio, providing funding for new loans

or reduction, since 1939. In November 2011, the Board of Directors approved a 6.3% increase of our quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share. This rise reflects both our current performance and our belief that Snap-on
is well-positioned for the future, while underscoring our commitment to create long-term shareholder value. In 2011, dividends paid per share of $1.30 represented
a return of $76.7 million to our shareholders.
Overall, 2011 was another very encouraging year that continued a multi-year positive trend. Considerable progress was made in both strengthening our strategic position and improving our operating execution, while we consistently demonstrated our ability to overcome external headwinds. We believe this performance
        
            CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
  confirms the underlying strength of our businesses, the ongoing potential of our runways for growth and the value of Snap-on as we ease the way for serious professionals performing critical tasks.
In 2011, we welcomed Henry W. Knueppel,
retired chairman of Regal-Beloit Corporation,
to the Board of Directors. Henry brings with
him extensive experience in the industrial arena
and has demonstrated many years of continuing business success. At the 2012 annual meeting,
we will bid farewell to Arthur L. Kelly and Bruce S. Chelberg, who have served as members of our Board of Directors since 1978 and 1993, respectively.
Over the years, they have been extraordinary guides, counselors and advisers to generations of Snap-on people. We are grateful for their contributions and feel fortunate to have had them as prominent players and leaders on the Snap-on team. We thank them both for their many years of dedicated service and we wish them all the best in the future. In addition, we thank all of our dedicated Board members for their continued and invaluable support. Finally, we thank our associates and franchisees around the world for their contributions, service and dedication, and
our customers and shareholders for their ongoing confidence and commitment.
Nicholas T. Pinchuk
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
In 2011, Snap-on made continued advancements along its coherent runways for growth, including extending to critical industries beyond automotive repair. One important area of opportunity lies in aviation and aerospace, where an expanded product offering provides solutions for professionals on flight lines, in assembly facilities and in MRO operations.
