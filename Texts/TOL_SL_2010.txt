Toll Brothers 2010

Dear Shareholder
Facing reduced competition, we are supported by a strong balance sheet, diverse product lines, a broad geographic footprint, and our brand name reputation
These are tumultuous times. In December two years ago, the economy was reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial crisis. Last year in December, the flood of federal stimulus money was raising hopes that better times would soon be upon us. Our hopes were raised as well, as the market for our homes showed solid improvement through late May of 2010 and we actually began raising prices in some communities in some regions. Unfortunately, in late May the market rolled over and we went back on the defensive as the persistent drag of high unemployment, reduced home equity, weak consumer confidence, and frustration with the nation's economic and political climate outweighed the appeal of historic low interest rates and tremendous home affordability. Even though the unemployment rate among our buyers is about half that of the national average, which should be contributing to pent-up demand, many of our clients remain on the sidelines waiting for clearer signs that the economy is on the road to recovery. Clearly, the key to sustained and substantial profitability is the return of normalized demand. We continue to position ourselves for this recovery through the opportunistic and prudent purchase of land and the growth of our community count. For the first time since FY 2005, our land position grew from the beginning to the end of our fiscal year. We ended FY 2010 with approximately 34,900 home sites owned and optioned, compared to approximately 31,900 one year ago. And, for the first time in four years, we expect our community count will grow. While we ended FY 2010 with 195 selling communities compared to 200 at FYE 2009, we expect to finish FY 2011 with between 215 and 225 selling communities. Our FY 2010 financial results showed improvement, but still reflect the difficult climate in which we operated. For our fiscal year ended October 31, 2010, we reported a net loss of $3.4 million, or $0.02 per share diluted, compared to a net loss of $755.8 million, or $4.68 per share diluted, for FY 2009. We reported a pre-tax loss in FY 2010 of $117.2 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $496.5 million in FY 2009. FY 2010's inventory write-downs totaled $115.3 million, compared to $476.7 million of inventory and joint venture write-downs in FY 2009, and charges related to early retirement of debt totaled $1.2 million in FY 2010, compared to $13.7 million in FY 2009. Excluding inventory writedowns and early debt retirement charges, FY 2010's pre-tax loss was $0.7 million, compared to a pre-tax loss of $6.1 million in FY 2009. In FY 2010, home building revenues of $1.49 billion and 2,642 units declined 15% in dollars and 11% in units, compared to FY 2009. FY 2010 net signed contracts of $1.47 billion and 2,605 units increased 13% in dollars and 6% in units, compared to FY 2009. Our FYE 2010 backlog of $852.1 million and 1,494 units declined 3% in dollars and 2% in units, compared to our FYE 2009 backlog. With backlog relatively flat, as we write this, we currently estimate that we will deliver between 2,100 and 2,900 homes in FY 2011 at an average price of between $540,000 and $565,000 per home. There were other positives in FY 2010. In our fourth quarter, we achieved modest profitability on a pre-tax pre-write-down basis for the second consecutive quarter. Year-over-year, we reduced our FY 2010 SG&A, excluding interest, by approximately $50 million or 16%, and showed a slight improvement in gross margins before write-offs and interest. And

Toll Brothers 2010

in FY 2010, our contract cancellation rate (fiscal year cancellations divided by fiscal year gross signed contracts) returned to relative normalcy: For the full FY 2010, it was 6.6% as a percentage of gross signed contracts, compared to 15.6% for FY 2009. In FY 2010 we took several key steps in leadership transition that had been in planning for several years. Robert Toll, Chairman and CEO since the Company's inception, moved into the role of Executive Chairman as Doug Yearley, a 20-year Toll veteran, ascended to the CEO role. In September, we mourned the passing of Joel Rassman, our CFO since 1984, after a long, hard battle with leukemia. Joel helped us prepare for this sad day. Two years ago, when Joel learned of the severity of his illness, Marty Connor joined us as Assistant CFO and brought with him a decade-long relationship with our Company as our auditor at Ernst & Young. In September of this year, Marty stepped into the CFO role as planned. These transitions have been relatively seamless as both Doug and Marty were well known to and well respected by our associates and the investment community. To capitalize on Toll Brothers' expertise and nationwide presence and to pursue additional real estate opportunities arising from our industry's distress, we formed Gibraltar Capital and Asset Management, LLC ("Gibraltar" ). With a quick start out of the gate, Gibraltar, in a joint venture with Oaktree Capital Management and Milestone Merchant Partners, acquired, in a partnership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an approximately $1.7 billion (face value) portfolio of mainly distressed residential communities consisting of former Amtrust Bank real estate loans and bank-owned properties. We continued to fortify our balance sheet. In FY 2009, we were the first public home building company to tap the public debt markets and raised $650 million to reduce shorter-term debt. In FY 2010, we again broke ground: We finalized a new four-year $885 million bank credit facility, which was the first new unsecured bank transaction in our industry since the financial crisis of 2008. We believe this facility reflects the confidence our bank group has in the strength of our balance sheet and our future prospects. We ended FY 2010 with approximately $800 million available under this facility as well as over $1.2 billion in available

cash and marketable securities. This facility and available funds, combined with our demonstrated ability to raise capital in the public markets under challenging conditions, have given us the liquidity to take advantage of distressed opportunities in the market. With a FYE 2010 net debt-tocapital ratio(1) of 13.6%, we should have a great deal of flexibility to raise additional capital if the need arises. This housing downturn is the longest and most severe since the Great Depression; however, we believe that the future for Toll Brothers and our industry is bright. Over the past 30 years, single-family, multi-family, and manufactured housing completions have averaged 1.683 million units per year. A recent Harvard University study projects similar demand in this new decade. Based on the very low housing production over the past few years, we believe that pent-up demand is building and will be released once the employment and economic picture improves and people regain confidence. In many markets, the pipeline of approved home sites has dwindled as builders and developers have lacked both the capital and the rationale for bringing sites through approvals. Therefore, when demand picks up, builders and developers with approved land in well-located markets should benefit. We believe that this will be particularly true for Toll Brothers. The other major public builders are primarily focused on the lower-priced segment of the market. Our main competitors are small and mid-sized local and regional private builders. We believe we have competitive advantages over them including our strong balance sheet, brand, quality, access to capital, and purchasing power. We, therefore, see opportunity for market share gains for Toll Brothers when the market recovers. Although the key word is "when," we are confident we are well positioned for the recovery. We thank our shareholders for their continued support, our suppliers and contractors for their cooperative spirit, our capital providers for their confidence in our future, and our homeowners for putting their trust in us. We thank the associates of Toll Brothers for their dedication to providing our homeowners with the highest quality, value, and service and for their commitment to building what has become the leading brand in our industry.
