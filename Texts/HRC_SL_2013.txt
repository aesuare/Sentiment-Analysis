           To Our Fellow
SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES
AND CUSTOMERS
ALL Of uS AT HILL-ROM COME TO wORk EvERy DAy, INSPIRED by OuR MISSION: EvERy DAy, AROuND THE wORLD, wE ENHANCE OuTCOMES fOR PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIvERS. That mission comes to life in many different ways. It may mean getting a patient up and out of bed sooner, and enabling one caregiver to do it without having to call for assistance. It may mean allowing a Cystic Fibrosis patient to live a normal, daily
life. It may mean reducing the risk of hospital-acquired infections by helping hospital staff to be more compliant with infection-reduction protocols. It may mean protecting patients from the miseries of pressure ulcers. It may mean allowing a surgeon to reposition her patient with confidence, or ensuring that she doesn’t cut herself with a scalpel that’s not properly safeguarded. It may mean introducing the first electric bed to a nascent health care system in an emerging market. It may mean transforming the modern ICU. But whatever the specifics, the impact remains the same – better outcomes for better health.
 This year we’ve continued to hone our approach to our mission. That approach is now articulated as Our Hill-Rom Commitment, which translates our values into the practices that guide our work. In the center of this wheel are our values. This is our
DNA, the yardstick by which we measure our company’s character. Surrounding our values are our key areas
of focus, the things we work on every day. At the perimeter of the wheel are the gears that make
our progress sustainable: diligent planning, repeatable process, and assessing performance so we can continuously improve. This is Our Hill-Rom Commitment – to our patients, to
our customers, to our shareholders, to our communities, to each other, and to anyone with whom we work. For more on Our Hill-Rom Commitment, please see page five of our online Annual Review, which can be found by visiting Hill-Rom.com/2013AnnualReview.

         2013 was another difficult year for all medical device companies
– particularly those in the capital sector – and Hill-Rom was no exception. The “new normal” appears to be a global economy in flux and any stability we do see appears tentative. In our more mature markets, hospitals everywhere are looking for ways to
cut costs; more than ever before, hospitals are being thoughtful about the level of service they want to provide, deciding what
is essential and what isn’t, looking for what truly will make a difference in outcomes, and discarding what will be merely incremental. In developing markets, the circumstances are different, but governments the world over are asking the same question: how can we deliver the optimal care to the most people for the least cost? This is the world in which our customers, our caregivers and our patients live. The troubled global economy and volatile health care market conditions have placed our customers under unprecedented pressure.
Despite the difficult conditions, we were able to increase revenue by five percent, from $1,634 million in 2012 to $1,716 million
in 2013. We maintained operating cash flow at $263 million (compared to $262 million in the previous year), and we were able to deliver on our most important financial strategic priorities: investing for growth and providing meaningful returns to shareholders. We continued to integrate our 2012 acquisitions
of Völker and Aspen Surgical, and made significant investments in our R&D and Quality organizations.
While making these crucial investments, we nonetheless delivered Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) at the high end of our initial annual guidance. We also raised our quarterly dividend per share by 10 percent, and repurchased approximately $94 million of Hill-Rom shares – returning almost 50 percent of Hill-Rom’s operating cash flow to our shareholders. Our Adjusted EPS
declined slightly compared to 2012, but our focus on cash flow and capital deployment contributed to a 24.6 percent total shareholder return. This was above the S&P 500 and our peer group, as shown in the chart above.
We continued to expand our international operations, and we
are proud of the dedication of our international team. We have
an increasingly strong network of country and regional general managers, who bring experience and dedication to the service
of our customers. They delivered over $500 million in revenue during 2013, an increase of 6% over 2012. It is especially worth mentioning our French business, which achieved record revenues in excess of $100 million for the first time. We continue to maintain our position as an industry leader in mature markets, and to pursue expansion in emerging markets.
It was a building year for our Surgical and Respiratory teams.
A lot of work was done on the integration of Aspen Surgical,
and we focused on operational improvement in all our Surgical and Respiratory businesses. We launched several products and strengthened our management team. Along with our industry- leading products, which provide the best choices for our patients and their caregivers, our work in 2013 positioned the business for profitable growth in 2014 and beyond.
We are proud of the fact that we have kept our commitments
to our shareholders, managed our portfolio aggressively, and maintained our disciplined focus on creating both short-term and long-term value. We expect 2014 to bring external conditions that are just as volatile and challenging as last year’s, but I am confident that we have the team and the focus and the discipline to continue driving growth for Hill-Rom and value for our shareholders in the coming year and beyond.

 INNOvATION
FuELS OuR GROWTH
FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE Drives Value
Innovation is a key element of the Hill-Rom legacy. We are committed to continued investment in Research and Development, and 2013 took that commitment to new heights. We opened two new R&D facilities, one in the Boston area and one in the Research Triangle region of North Carolina, so that we could access the best and brightest engineering talent. We look forward to this expanded R&D presence – along with our existing R&D centers in France, Singapore, Sweden, Germany and the U.S. – fueling game-changing innovation and growth.
Continuing the Hill-Rom tradition of industry-leading innovation, we launched four significant new products during 2013:
THE PROGRESSA® bED SySTEM
[   ] Hill-Rom’s first new intensive care bed system in a decade, the Progressa Bed System transforms the bed into an extension of the health care team. The Progressa Bed System addresses the clinical and practical needs of the ICU, supporting early mobility and reducing the risk of complications associated with immobility. The Progressa
Bed System brings our exclusive StayInPlaceTM technology to hospitals, which keeps the patient from sliding down in the bed by automatically extending the frame and surface to accommodate the natural elongation of the body as the patient sits up. The initial response from ICU staff has been very positive and we expect the Progressa Bed System to continue Hill-Rom’s record of setting the global standard for ICU care.
THE ALLEN® ADvANCE TAbLE
[   ] Our latest surgical positioning product is the Allen Advance Table. It provides surgeons with the market’s most complete spinal positioning platform with a focus on safety for the patient, surgeons and staff. The Allen Advance table is the first to address the safety risk of inadvertently pulling the wrong pin and causing a table
collapse during a procedure. It offers a better table with a better footprint and at a better price point than competitors’, marking a major step forward for spinal surgery, and for Hill-Rom’s surgical business.
THE HILL-ROM® HAND HyGIENE COMPLIANCE SOLuTION
[ ] Nearly every major public health organization agrees that effective “hand-hygiene” (hand washing or using disinfecting sprays, wipes or gels) is one of the best ways to prevent deadly and costly hospital-acquired infections. Yet, compliance rates among caregivers are notoriously difficult to track and often found to be very
low. The new Hill-Rom Hand Hygiene Compliance Solution builds on research showing monitoring and reminder programs can help. The RFID-powered system is easily installed and monitors 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It provides real-time compliance data to administrators, managers and staff members, allowing for immediate feedback and simplifying compliance reporting.
For administrators it is also an efficient infrastructure investment. A system installed today can be leveraged to add broader staff locating, asset tracking, temperature monitoring, and patient locating tools tomorrow.
THE METANEb® 4.0 SySTEM
[ ] Our newest addition to Hill-Rom’s respiratory care portfolio, the MetaNeb 4.0 System, provides three lung therapies in one. The MetaNeb system is indicated to mobilize secretions to help clear a patient’s lungs, for lung expansion therapy, and for treating and preventing pulmonary atelectasis in patients with a variety of respiratory
conditions. By combining these therapies into a single, integrated system, the MetaNeb 4.0 System maximizes efficiency for patients and clinicians. The MetaNeb 4.0 System is an important addition to Hill-Rom’s state-of-the-art airway clearance portfolio, which is a leader in the industry and for our company.
These new products represent significant advances in each of their categories. Together with our focus on and investment in research and development, we are well positioned to maintain our market-leading brand and growth in 2014 and beyond.
   
 PEOPLE INSPIRED
TO WIN TOGETHER
Cognizant of the challenges facing our customers around the world, we are always looking at whether we are organized in the best possible way to serve them. 2013 was no exception.
In our North America business, we launched a Commercial Excellence initiative that realigned our U.S. sales team for more specific focus on different segments of the market. We are now organized to tailor our approach by customer, so that we can deploy the right person, in the right role, with the right strategy. This includes freeing up our Clinical Outcomes Managers so that they can be fully dedicated to driving sustainable and measurable clinical outcomes for our customers; identifying one responsible account executive for each customer, so that one person is the lead on all account strategy development and selling execution; and investing in our Strategic Partnership Team to serve our largest accounts. With these changes, we are ready to meet the demands of the increasingly competitive North America markets.
We also made several outstanding additions to our team in 2013. We announced the appointment of our new Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, James (“Jay”) Saccaro. Jay joins us from Baxter International, Inc., where he held positions of increasing responsibility over his 11-year career there. He most recently served as Baxter’s Vice President and Global Franchise Head
for specialty Pharmaceuticals, a $1.5 billion business consisting primarily of anesthesia and nutritional products. Before that, Jay was Baxter’s Corporate Vice President and Treasurer and, prior to
LOOKING AHEAD
that role, was the Vice President of Finance for Baxter’s Europe, Middle East and Africa business. He held a number of other strategic planning and finance positions during his tenure at Baxter. He brings to Hill-Rom a proven record of delivering strong financial and operating results and extensive experience leading global health care teams. He is an outstanding addition to our leadership team as we continue to pursue our growth strategy and deliver increased value for our shareholders. We are delighted to have him on board.
In late October, we also welcomed Taylor Smith to Hill-Rom as our Senior Vice President and President of Surgical and Respiratory
Care. Taylor joined us from Cardinal Health, where most recently he was the Senior Vice President and General Manager for Cardinal’s Orthopedic Products and Services group. For the last 13 years, Taylor has held various positions of increasing responsibility at Cardinal, including National Vice President of Sales for the Surgical Division. Like Jay, Taylor is a seasoned executive and a great addition to our team. I look forward to working with Taylor to grow our Surgical and Respiratory Care business around the globe.
These additions to our executive team exemplify the kind of top talent Hill-Rom attracts today at all levels. It is a testament to the quality of our brand, our products, our people, our culture, and our prospects for the future that some of the finest talent in the industry is drawn to Hill-Rom.
 As always, it is our commitment to our customers and each other that makes me proudest when I reflect back on each year. Together we are establishing a foundation that will bring needed advancements to our customers and propel our company for years ahead.
I hope you will take the time to visit Hill-Rom.com/2013AnnualReview to learn more about all we accomplished in 2013 – how the Progressa Bed System has quickly become the standard of care in the ICU, how the Allen Advance Table has finally given surgical spine patients the safety they and their surgeons deserve, and how our customer-immersion approach to research and development is creating an innovation pipeline that will provide years of inspiration as we pursue our mission of enhancing outcomes for patients and their caregivers.
We are fortunate to work in a business that can directly improve life’s most precious commodity – health. It’s an honor and a responsibility that motivates all of us at Hill-Rom. We are proud of the impact we have had in the year just past, and eager to achieve even more in 2014. Thank you for your role in helping advance our shared mission.
        JOHN J. GREISCH, PRESIDENT AND CEO, HILL-ROM
