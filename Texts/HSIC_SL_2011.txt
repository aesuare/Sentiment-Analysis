 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS: A MESSAGE FROM STANLEY BERGMAN
            As part of our 2012-2014 Strategic Plan, we have identified six priorities for our Company, known internally as “GO HSIC”:
• Global Growth: We are the global leader by continuing to expand through focused business development and enhancing the Henry Schein brand. We will continue to improve our global reach, expand geographically and develop global leadership for our Company.
• Optimization: We will focus and optimize the use of our capital and other resources throughout the organization. To do this, we will continue to develop lean, streamlined and best-in-class processes and practices to improve efficiency
and reduce costs. We will drive efficiencies by capitalizing on best practices and developing key performance metrics to measure our progress.
• Human Capital: We will continually develop Team Schein Members,
our most valuable asset, through leadership development, competitive compensation and recruiting. We also will enhance communication, diversity and cultural competency throughout the organization, and support social responsibility programs in our communities around the world.
• Supplier Relationships: We are determined to be an even better partner for our suppliers and by far their most important customer. We will become our suppliers’ distributor of choice, obtaining the lowest cost and best value, and continue to focus on our exclusive and semi-exclusive products.
• Insights: We are committed to knowing our customers better than our competitors do. To achieve
this we will enhance our formal processes to gather insights on
our customers and use these insights to develop customer solutions.
• Customer Solutions: We will develop and provide high value, differentiated, integrated solutions to meet our customers’ clinical and business needs, as well as innovative sales and marketing programs for these solutions.
This will include specialization and technology leadership.
We also will continue to build and expand our global information database to strengthen relationships with our supplier partners, customers and their patients.

    “As we begin our 80th year, we eagerly anticipate the new opportunities
that 2012 will bring.”
The key priorities and initiatives of our 2012-2014 Strategic Plan reflect how far Henry Schein has come and recognize the size and scope of our organization. Since becoming a publicly traded company in 1995,
our revenues have grown from $616 million to $8.5 billion in 2011. In
1990 we were just starting to enter countries beyond the United States. Today our business outside of North America generates approximately
$3 billion in sales to practitioners in more than 200 countries. In the future, we expect that our international
sales will continue to grow as a
percentage of our overall sales in each succeeding year.
As we begin our 80th year, we eagerly anticipate the new opportunities that 2012 will bring. We remain committed to being a trusted advisor to our customers, and being our suppliers’ most important customer. We will continue to strive to provide our stockholders with an excellent return on investment, and ensure that Team Schein remains our most important asset in our values-based culture.
We will sustain our efforts to expand access to care around the world
through Henry Schein Cares, our global social responsibility program. And we remain convinced that our best years are yet to come.
On behalf of our Board of Directors and my Team Schein colleagues, thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Stanley M. Bergman
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
