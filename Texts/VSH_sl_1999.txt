 To Our Shareholders, Employees, Customers, and Vendors:
We are entering the new millennium with optimism for Vishay! Increasing demand for Vishay’s products is being driven by the very large increase of the cell phone market and other wireless communication devices, as well as renewed strength in the computer and automotive markets. These end markets combined account for approximately 70% of the sales of our products, with wireless communications representing approximately 35% of our sales. Annual global shipments of cell phones have increased from 110 million units in 1997 to 283 million units in 1999. The forecast for year 2000 is 420 million units. At the same time, the number of passive components per phone increased dramatically.
As a result of this strong demand, our bookings (orders) were $2.0 billion in 1999, a 30% increase over 1998 bookings. As a consequence, we increased capacity in all our major product lines to meet this continuing demand for our products.
Our Siliconix operation (80.4% owned by Vishay) reported record results for 1999 with net earnings of $66 million as compared to $738 thousand in 1998. Net sales were a record $383 million in 1999, a 36% increase over $282 million in 1998.
The demand for Siliconix’s products continues to be strong, especially in the wireless communications markets. This strength for Siliconix products, as well as the diodes and transistors of our Telefunken operation, resulted in 43% of our 1999 sales in semiconductor products as compared to 35% of our sales in 1998. We are quite pleased with the success of our Siliconix-Telefunken acquisition and we believe that as a result, we are now more strongly positioned as a leader in discrete semiconductor technology and the market.
Our passive component business has also started to show much improved orders, first in capacitors, then followed by resistors and inductors. We have shown a significant increase in profitability, which can be attributed to production efficiencies, cost reduction programs, including movement of labor to low-cost countries, price stabilization, and, in some products, price increases. Most of the price increases are still in the backlog and will begin to be reflected in the first quarter of year 2000 and thereafter. In fact, on March 29, 2000, we announced that earnings per share for the first quarter ending March 31, 2000 should exceed analysts’ estimates of $0.54 per share by at least 25%. This was an additional increase in our results from an announcement made on March 2, 2000 when we announced that we would exceed analysts’ estimates at that time of $0.44 by at least 20% and now represents a 54% increase over these estimates.
Vishay had 21,124 employees as of December 31, 1999; 15,861 of them are outside the United States, often in low labor cost countries.
As a Company, we have worked hard during the past year. Successes have included the release of 150 new products, cost cutting in manufacturing and other areas, and a substantial increase in Asian sales to over $500 million in 1999. Our cash generation is also very strong. During 1999, we reduced long-term debt by $157,895,000. With the current strong demand for our products, our continuing cost reduction programs, and aggressive new product introductions, the outlook for the year 2000 looks much better.
On March 27, 2000, we announced that we had agreed to sell our 65% interest in Lite-On Power Semiconductor Corporation (“LPSC”) to Lite-On JV Corporation (“Lite-On Group”), the current owner of the remaining 35% interest in LPSC, for consideration consisting of cash and the assignment or transfer of stock appreciation rights in Vishay common stock held by the Lite-On Group or the proceeds thereof. The disposition of our interest in LPSC will allow Vishay to focus its active components strategy on its Siliconix and Telefunken businesses, over which it has full control and which have been performing very well. We didn’t achieve the results we expected from LPSC and have decided to sell it back to the party we bought it from. Depending on the value of the stock appreciation rights at the time of execution of the documents, there could be a one-time gain or loss as a result of this transaction, which is expected to close before September 30, 2000. The sale of LPSC should have a positive annual impact on Vishay’s earnings going forward by approximately $0.08 to $0.10 per share.
Financial Highlights
For the year ended December 31, 1999, sales were $1,760,091,000 compared with $1,572,745,000 in the previous year. Net earnings, before special charges, for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $97,799,000 or $1.14 per share. After special charges of $14,562,000 or $0.17 per share, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 1999
A Message from the Chairman
  
   were $83,237,000 or $0.97 per share. The 1999 special charges were primarily a result of the sale of Nicolitch, S.A., a French manufacturer of printed circuit boards, a non-core business of Vishay, which was completed on March 26, 1999. Net earnings before special charges for the year ended December 31, 1998 were $63,547,000 or $0.76 per share. After special charges of $55,335,000 or $0.66 per share, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 1998 were $8,212,000 or $0.10 per share. With the strong rebound in earnings per share in the third and fourth quarters of 1999, we are confident of a strong year 2000.
Earnings per share amounts for all periods reflect a 5-for-4 stock split paid June 22, 1999.
Sales of the passive components business were $1,008,266,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to sales of $1,027,902,000 for 1998 and operating income was $104,655,000 as compared to operating income of $114,747,000 for 1998. Sales of the active components business were $751,825,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999, as compared to sales of $544,843,000 for 1998 resulting in operating income of $119,510,000 as com- pared to operating income of $51,516,000 for 1998, an increase of 132%.
Gross profits for the year ended December 31, 1999 were 26.2% of sales as compared to 24.4% in the prior year. The active components business reported gross margins of 31.4% for the year ended December 31, 1999, as compared to 27.9% for the prior year. The passive components business gross profit margins were 22.4% for the year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to 22.5% for the prior year.
Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 1999 were 14.5% of sales as com- pared to 14.9% in the prior year.
The Company is generating substantial cash and its financial condition is strong with a current ratio of 2.7 to 1.0. For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company’s cash flow from operations was $239,809,000. Purchases of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $119,638,000 as compared to $151,682,000 in the prior year. Long-term debt was reduced by $157,895,000 from $814,838,000 at December 31, 1998 to $656,943,000 at December 31, 1999.
Looking Ahead
During the second half of 1999, Vishay began to show the results of our strength in the passive components business as well as our semiconductor business. In the year 2000 and beyond, we will continue to build on that strength and our historical position as a leader in the U.S., European, and Asian electronics markets. We are focused on being a total solution provider — a manufacturer of passive electronic components and a major producer of discrete semi- conductors and selected integrated circuits. Vishay components are vital to the operation of electronic products found in virtually all electronic applications.
The Company is committed, through our state-of-the-art technology, our increasing research and development, and through an acquisition strategy targeting companies with advanced technology resources, to continually strive to introduce the most advanced components in the industry to satisfy the ever-changing customer demands in today’s dynamic marketplace.
We are extremely grateful to our employees worldwide for their loyalty, skill, and energy, which have contributed significantly to our growth. We value highly the relationship we have with our customers and suppliers. To our fellow shareholders, we thank you for your continued confidence in Vishay. We look forward to the year 2000 being the best year ever.
Sincerely,
Dr. Felix Zandman
