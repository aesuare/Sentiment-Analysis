TO OUR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
e would like to begin our letter this year by simply saying 2015 was another great year for O'Reilly. Our dedicated Team once again maintained its relentless focus on providing consistently high levels of service to our customers, and their efforts drove another record-breaking year for our Company. Before we highlight some of our 2015 accomplishments, we would like to recognize and thank the more than 71,000 dedicated members of Team O'Reilly for their hard work and continued commitment to our past, current, and future success. We are very proud of our record-breaking 2015 results, highlighted by an industry leading 7.5% increase in comparable store sales, which was on top of a very strong 6.0% increase in 2014 and represents our 23rd consecutive year of positive comparable store sales growth.

OUR CULTURE

Growth for the sake of growth, however, is not our focus; rather, we are absolutely committed to sustainable, profitable growth. Our focus on actively managing our expenses translated our robust sales performance into a record high operating profit of 19.0% and diluted earnings per share growth of 25%, which is our seventh consecutive year of 20% or greater earnings per share growth. We also returned more than $1.1 billion to you, our shareholders, during 2015 in the form of share repurchases.

are dedicated "Professional Parts People" who are committed to providing consistently superior service to every customer who calls or walks into one of our stores. Our highly trained and technically proficient Team Members can be seen in stores across the country answering questions, tracking down hard-to-find parts, and smiling behind the counter, on the phone or in the aisles as they assist our customers. Doing whatever it takes to offer our customer the best products and highest level of service is who we are and how we remain committed to being the dominant supplier of auto parts in every market we serve.

OUR STORE TEAM MEMBERS

taining our existing store and distribution base, and growing organically through new store openings. We successfully opened 205 net, new stores in markets across the United States during 2015. We continue to be very pleased with our store growth opportunities both in newer market areas for O'Reilly, including Central and Southern Florida, the Northeast U.S. and the Middle Atlantic U.S., and backfill in markets where we already have a strong market presence, including Texas, the Western U.S. and Upper Great Lakes. New store site selection is very involved and incorporates many variables into the decision process, and we have been pleased with the sites we have been able to acquire for new stores. However, the ultimate success of a new store is dependent upon staffing the store with a well-trained Team of Professional Parts People who are ready to roll up their sleeves and provide great service the day the store opens. Great teams are formed by promoting hard working Team Members, who understand and live our Culture Values, and giving them an opportunity to replicate these

Culture Values in new Team Members. We also continued to expand and enhance our robust distribution network in 2015 with the construction of our newest distribution center outside of San Antonio, Texas, which is scheduled to open in the second quarter of 2016. This new distribution center will provide our stores in Texas with even higher levels of service, while also supporting additional growth, and our distribution operations teams have a proven record of bringing new distribution centers online effectively and ready to provide unsurpassed parts availability to our stores. After reinvestment in our existing new stores, industry consolidation is the next priority for our use of cash; however, we remain a disciplined and opportunistic buyer and did not have an opportunity that warranted our investment in this area during 2015. We believe there are existing chains that would be a good fit for our Culture and footprint and provide a strong return on our investment, and we will continue to monitor the acquisition environment in the future.

continues to be driven by the hard work of our dedicated Team Members. In 2015, we opened 205 net, new stores, expanded into Connecticut, our 44th state, and began construction on our 27th distribution center, which will be located in Selma, Texas, outside of San Antonio. We will continue our long record of profitable growth in 2016, with 210 net, new store openings across our existing footprint and in new markets. Our new Texas DC, opening in the first half of 2016, will allow us to provide an even higher level of service to the San Antonio and Austin markets, while also creating capacity for continued growth.

OUR PROFITABLE GROWTH

available cash into our top three priorities, we were able to use our excess cash in 2015 to directly return more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases. We will continue to use share repurchases as a way to increase shareholder value in the future, after we have exhausted all other means of reinvesting in our business at a high rate of return. We would like to end our letter by again recognizing and thanking our dedicated Team Members for all of their contributions to our record breaking 2015 results. Their relentless focus on living our Culture Values every day, and instilling those values in each new member who joins our team, has been the reason for our record breaking past accomplishments and will be the key to our future success. We are very honored that you, our shareholders, continue to place your confidence and trust in our Team. We are very proud of our strong financial performance in 2015, as well as our long track record of consistently strong results, and we remain committed to extending this record of profitable growth in 2016.
