Chairman’s Letter
 “Booz Allen’s capabilities and focus on our clients’ core missions, and our effective business management, have enabled us to succeed despite a challenging market.” — Dr. Ralph W. Shrader
Dear Colleagues and Shareholders:
One hundred years ago, Edwin G. Booz had an original idea that business leaders could benefit from rigorous analysis of markets and operations and from objective advice. In 2014, the company he founded stands strong as the premier consultancy helping government and commercial clients achieve their most important missions. As technology evolves, missions expand, and budgetary pressures persist, Booz Allen Hamilton responds with innovative solutions that help organizations solve their most complex problems. We engage with many of the most important issues of our time—national security, healthcare and financial reform, immigration, energy and the environment, and much more. And our nearly 23,000 people create value by pioneering new products and technologies, by deriving actionable insights from data, by preemptively defeating cyber threats, and by applying multidimensional thinking to generate unique solutions.
Equally important, we approach everything we do with a deep commitment of service to our clients, to our communities, and to the veterans who have served us. We’re able to bring the best of the best together to pursue missions in cross-functional, highly collaborative ways that others cannot. Our professionals bring their brains, hearts, and values to everything they do. It is a great accomplishment that 100 years later, our people who follow in Ed Booz’s footsteps make a tremendous difference.

The Power of Innovation
In Fiscal 2014, Booz Allen marked its centennial anniversary by investing in the future. On January 2, 2014, we rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, signaling our commitment to investors and to the broader financial community. We’re sponsoring the Degas/Cassatt exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, which explores the themes of collaboration and innovation. We’re also sponsoring three flagship events at the USS Midway Museum in San Diego to commemorate veterans and the US military community. And to honor our legacy of community engagement, we established a Centennial Community Challenge program to encourage Booz Allen employees to collectively volunteer 100,000 hours in 2014.
To drive sustainable growth during our second century, we moved forward with our Vision 2020 strategy on two parallel tracks: a set of growth platforms tied to specific market opportunities and an evolving client base; and enabling initiatives to further strengthen our business processes. We’re actively designing and building profitable, scalable businesses of the future—programs and technologies focused on solving the big problems that many of our government, commercial, and international clients confront. Our Strategic Innovation
Group is helping us nurture a culture of innovation that inspires and empowers our people to identify and deconstruct client problems and develop solutions that create value for our clients and the firm. We’re already seeing adjacent and transformational innovation in the areas of cloud computing, advanced analytics, predictive intelligence, and engineering of rapid prototypes.
Technology and engineering have emerged as an especially strong growth platform. With the successful integration of the Defense Systems Engineering and Support Division of ARINC Incorporated, which we renamed Booz Allen Hamilton Engineering Services, our expanded capabilities now include deployment of advanced technological solutions and techniques, scientific exploration, rapid prototyping, full-spectrum engineering, program development, and integration. Additionally, advancements in analytics and predictive intelligence helped us expand our position in the commercial and international markets.
We also began to build the strategic infrastructure to support these platforms. We are deploying multiple business models within Booz Allen that take us beyond traditional consulting. In FY14, we expanded our Cyber4SightTM managed services offering to include new Global4Sight and Insider4Sight capabilities, developed specialized prototypes for defense and law enforcement clients, and introduced our groundbreaking PolarisTM real-time project analysis software. And the new People Model we rolled out will truly support the diverse needs and skills of our employees and our business. To respond to an increasingly technical market, we created new career paths that include separate tracks for traditional management consulting and for engineering
and technology. This model also includes an innovative “functional community” concept that promotes collaboration while enhancing opportunities to develop and deploy valuable intellectual capital. By increasing engagement and retention, we can ensure we have the elite workforce necessary to compete—and excel—as the market evolves.

A Resilient Enterprise
These investments—combined with disciplined financial management and continued success in such key growth areas as C4ISR, cybersecurity, and healthcare analytics—enabled us to overcome challenging market conditions and reward our investors with solid financial performance.
• Full-year revenue declined 4.9%, to $5.48 billion, due primarily to fewer billable hours and the impact of the
government shutdown.
• Free cash flow was $311.8 million, compared with $431.5 million in the prior year.
• Adjusted net income increased to $241.9 million, from $239.5 million in the prior year.
• Total backlog stood at $9.84 billion at March 31, 2014, compared with $11.54 billion in the prior year.
• Adjusted EBITDA increased by 1% to $534.0 million.
• We delivered $2.40 in dividends during FY14, which together with our share price appreciation represented
a total return to shareholders of more than 86% over the 12 months ended March 31, 2014.
Our financial discipline served us especially well as we confronted continued sequestration and the government shutdown that occurred in October 2013. By planning ahead and managing resources tightly during the first half of our fiscal year, we fulfilled our commitment to employees in a way that few if any peer institutions could. We believe the funds we expended to continue to employ affected staff through the 16-day shutdown was money very well spent. We also repriced our debt to reduce our interest rates for the remaining term of our credit agreement and completed a secondary stock offering that was oversubscribed. We will continue to look for ways to leverage all our firm’s resources to grow top-line revenue and generate the bottom-line results our shareholders expect.
Creating New Opportunity
With Vision 2020, Booz Allen has a solid platform in place to accelerate growth when market conditions improve. Our diverse and energized executive leadership team is working together effectively to evolve our business. Together, we coalesced around the firm’s Vision 2020 strategy and are successfully executing it.
We will miss the valuable contributions of several senior executives who announced their retirement earlier this year after distinguished careers at Booz Allen. Among them are Sam Strickland, who has worked by my side to provide valuable counsel and outstanding financial leadership for the last 18 years. He led our IPO and applied his talent, dedication, and core values to help us achieve the financial strength and stability we have today. Also retiring is Mike McConnell, the former Director of National Intelligence, who contributed the deep insights and strong external voice that helped Booz Allen build our market-leading cybersecurity business. Generations of Booz Allen leaders have committed themselves to passing on a strengthened heritage for our successors, and we are fortunate to have many talented and experienced people who will be able to lead us for a long time to come. These include the Client Service Officers who remain the heart and soul of our business.

Engineering Second-century Growth
While the 2014 federal budget resolution creates some stability and clarity around how the government will spend its available funds, I’m always mindful of the potential for discontinuity. This is especially true during election cycles, and we are managing our cost posture and spending profile accordingly.
Our relentless focus on client success and our disciplined approach to running our business help us manage this uncertainty with greater confidence. We understand what our business is, what our market is, and what kind of organization we are. Booz Allen is fortunate to have built a strong reputation for being the best at what we do. This track record is especially attractive during challenging times, when clients look to the premier firm to keep its promises and help them meet today’s mission and anticipate the future.
The key themes of this letter define the essence of what it takes to secure the future of our firm: investing in innovation and our employees, pursuing the commercial and international markets as we remain an essential partner to the US government, developing new capabilities, ensuring leadership continuity, and managing our financial resources prudently. In FY15, we will begin our second century of growth by focusing on three operational priorities. We will continue to implement—and refine our thinking about—both the growth
and the infrastructure dimensions of Vision 2020. We will continue to manage the day-to-day business prudently in the face of market turbulence. And we will work to ensure that people across our organization understand where we’re going, and feel inspired by the journey we’re on. Over the near term, we expect to gain market share in areas where we have identified strategic opportunity, and scale back in other areas that the government is de-emphasizing. By adhering to our clear strategy, we will continue to make a difference for clients around the world and help maintain our financial stability and generate the attractive returns to extend our legacy of success into our second century.

Sidebar
 On January 1, 2014, Chief Operating Officer Horacio D. Rozanski (above left) assumed the additional position of President. During his 20-year consulting career at Booz Allen, he has played a key role in major strategic initiatives that have redefined the firm as a Fortune 500 public company. As a key architect of Vision 2020, he is charting the firm’s future by leading efforts to renew Booz Allen’s culture of innovation; define new business models; and improve productivity, profitability, and service delivery.
Sam Strickland (above right), Booz Allen’s Chief Financial and Administrative Officer, announced that he will retire from Booz Allen on June 30, 2014, after 18 years of senior leadership. He led the major investment
in the firm by The Carlyle Group in 2008, was the officer-in-charge of Booz Allen’s successful initial public offering in November 2010, and most recently led the acquisition and integration of what is now Booz Allen Hamilton Engineering Services. His expertise in financial and business operations, information services, and infrastructure helped Booz Allen grow into the $5 billion-plus enterprise it is today.
