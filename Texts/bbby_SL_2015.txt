Dear Fellow Shareholders and Beyond:
We are pleased to have completed another successful year at Bed Bath & Beyond. During fiscal 2015 we made steady progress on our strategic initiatives which included significant investments in our business to further strengthen our foundation for future growth.
At the same time, we remained vigilant in our mission to:
• To do more for and with our customers wherever, whenever and however they wish to interact with us;
• To provide our customers a seamless experience whether they interact with us in a store, through one of our contact centers, on a desktop, tablet, smartphone or through social media; and
• To be viewed as the expert for the home, including the accompanying life stages that make a house a home—such as getting married, having a baby, transitioning to college, and moving to a new residence, and to become the destination for our customer’s needs and wants as they express their life interests and travel through their life stages; all through the expanding and differentiated products, services and solutions we offer.
As the retail environment continues to change dramatically and advancing technologies transform the way consumers shop for merchandise both online and in-store, we continue to challenge ourselves to better understand and satisfy our customers and in turn, build a better company. While these investments currently place pressure on our operating profit, we believe that our strong balance sheet and cash flows give us the capacity to make significant investments in our future. We are confident that this is an opportune time for us to drive change throughout our organization to capitalize on these new technologies and to strengthen our position as a world-class omnichannel retailer.
Our transformation over the past several years has been incredible. The steps we’ve taken to transform our business have been supported by key initiatives in areas such as information technology, analytics, pricing, merchandising, marketing, customer service, fulfillment and real estate.
In recalling the old cliché, you can’t know where you are going until you know where you have been, below is an update on our progress.
Over the past few years, we have:
• Upgraded or replaced the majority of our customer-facing and back-end systems and introduced new systems to enable us to utilize new technology while also enhancing the security and redundancy of our systems.
• Enhanced the functionality, general search and navigation features across our customer-facing digital channels so that customers can find what they are looking for more quickly and efficiently, as well as enabled the sale of personalized product, Vendor Direct to Consumer items, and product that utilizes Less-Than-Truckload shipping, such as furniture.
• Created new services and experiences for our customers such as online appointment scheduling for registry, and a new virtual coupon wallet called My Offers, which organizes and stores print and digital coupons so customers can access and redeem them conveniently online or in-store.
• Deployed new systems, equipment and increased the bandwidth in our stores to enable our associates to be more productive and to provide a more personalized customer experience.
• Continued development of a new Point-of-Sale system, which will begin piloting in fiscal 2016.
• Built a structured analytics department with robust quantitative capabilities to help drive enhanced performance and gain deep insights into how our customers interact with us across all our concepts, channels and countries in which we operate.
• Created a pricing team and put new systems in place to better track competitor pricing to maintain our competitive position within the market.
• Rolled out additional health & beauty care, baby, food and beverage specialty departments within our stores.
• Introduced new product categories, such as mattresses, jewelry and furniture, and significantly expanded our assortment in these and other categories.
• Begun to implement a new marketing campaign management system to better target our customers and drive personalization, and began to utilize sophisticated predictive modeling to drive a more customer-centric marketing strategy.

• Established a new customer contact center in Layton, Utah, during fiscal 2015, enhancing our 24/7 customer support.
• Developed more flexible fulfillment options for customer delivery and expanded our distribution facility network to support anticipated growth across all our channels. Opened a new distribution facility in Las Vegas, Nevada during fiscal 2015.
• Continued to evaluate our real estate portfolio and opened 29 and closed 12 stores during fiscal 2015. Opened stores in new markets, tested smaller-store formats, and developed plans to evolve our stores in such a way that is more experiential and reflects how our customers utilize the products, services and solutions we provide.
• Acquired Of a Kind in fiscal 2015, an e-commerce platform geared toward millennials that offers specially commissioned, limited-edition items from up-and-coming artists and designers.
• Introduced our newest andThat! store in Kennesaw, Georgia in April 2016, designing this store to have local appeal and to become the destination for customers to find an ever-changing mix of both differentiated and close-out merchandise, spanning categories such as home décor, seasonal, food, entertaining essentials, and gifts, ALL at a great value.
• Continued the development of a unique shopping venue in Brooklyn, New York, which will include four of our concepts under one roof, to showcase our ever-increasing and evolving merchandise assortment and the integration of our omnichannel capabilities to provide a more experiential shopping environment.
Our financial performance in fiscal 2015 reflects the benefit of the significant investments in our business and the steady progress on our strategic initiatives. We reported fiscal 2015 net sales of $12.1 billion, an increase of approximately 1.9%, or 2.3% on a constant currency basis, and net earnings per diluted share of $5.10. In addition, we generated about $1.0 billion in net cash from operations and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchase.
In recognition of our strong cash flow generation, and confidence in our business, as well as to provide a more balanced approach to returning value to shareholders, our Board of Directors has authorized a quarterly dividend program to commence in fiscal 2016.
This is an exciting time for our Company, and we are excited about our future. We believe the dynamic and ever changing retail environment presents a great opportunity for even greater success in the years ahead. The pace of change requires, and rewards, continuous innovation and the ability to adapt, as technology advances and consumer preferences evolve.
As a highly profitable market leader, we are committed to strengthening our business and making the strategic investments that will enable us to continue to do more for and with our customers. We’re committed to becoming even more relevant to our existing customers and attracting new customers as they choose where, when and how to shop.
As our business transforms, we will navigate the competitive landscape to adapt as customer preferences evolve. We will seek to attract the right people and have the right technologies and products to advance our strategy. All the while, we will remain disciplined in our efforts to achieve positive returns, and improve long-term profitability.
Our healthy cash flows, and strong balance sheet, enable us to fund these investments and build upon our operational achievements, while also returning value to our shareholders.
For those of you who have followed our Company for some time, you know that we manage our business for the long term. Our aim has never been to be the biggest, but always about being the best. Our focus has never been to optimize short-term profitability, but always about creating long-term prosperity. This has never been more relevant than it is today. We remain steadfast in making the correct investments for our long-term success.
We want to thank our more than 60,000 dedicated associates for what they accomplished during fiscal 2015. Our foundation has never been stronger. This includes the quality of our people, our merchandise assortments, and our technologies, each of which drives our Company’s success. Through the commitment of our associates, and the culture they have created, and the greatly valued contributions of our merchandise and service providers, we are looking forward to continue to satisfy our customers and in doing so, improving our competitive position in the categories in which we do business.
Thank you for your interest in Bed Bath & Beyond.
