Dear Shareholder: Every year, millions of travelers board aircraft that Spirit AeroSystems helped design and build. Our name isn't painted on the outside, but our workmanship is in those airplanes. The work we do is important, and future generations are counting on us to do it well.

It was a milestone year for Spirit AeroSystems. Across the globe, we marked our tenth anniversary, hosting celebrations with tens of thousands of our employees and their family members under the banner "10 & Rising." What a difference 10 years has made. When Spirit launched in 2005, the company operated facilities in two U.S. states, building products for a single customer. We produced about 27 airplane shipsets a month --

President and CEO

Fast forward to today. Spirit is a global company, serving a myriad of customers from locations on three continents. We have expanded our product line, acquiring new customers in both commercial aerospace and defense. We have more than doubled our monthly aircraft deliveries since 2006, and we are preparing to increase production further to meet our customers' demand. While we maintain our leadership position in the design, build and manufacture of metallic aerostructures, we are also a recognized leader in composites.

mostly metallic structures.

2015 Performance. This year, we made significant progress in managing the details of the business, resulting in more predictable performance. The proof is in our 2015 financial results. Spirit's net income was $789 million, or $5.66 per fully diluted share. We made remarkable improvements in free cash flow, which is now over $930 million, the highest ever in our 10-year history.* At year-end 2015, our backlog for customer orders stood at $47 billion. We achieved these results while making strategic capital investments to prepare for rate increases and long-term growth. Our improved financial performance is a testament to the agility and dedication of Spirit employees. Their skill, persistence and commitment continue to propel us forward as we navigate through our next 10 years and beyond.

Commercial programs. Spirit's commercial programs continued to thrive in 2015, and we marked some significant achievements: · We delivered the fuselage and other components for the first Boeing 737 MAX. Boeing has already booked several thousand orders for this cutting-edge aircraft. · We celebrated with Airbus as the A350 XWB ­ the world's newest widebody jetliner ­ completed its first commercial passenger flight. We also delivered the first fuselage and major wing components for the A350 -1000 derivative. · We achieved all-time-high build rates on the Boeing 737, Boeing 787 ,

Airbus A320, and Airbus A350 programs. Our customers have announced that production rates on these programs will continue to increase over the next five years. Defense programs. In 2015, we once again demonstrated the value we bring to the defense market: · We delivered the fuselage for the V-280 Valor Joint Multi-Role Technology Demonstrator to Bell Helicopter. The Spirit team designed and assembled the fuselage in our rapid-prototyping facility, delivering on-budget and ahead of schedule. · We continued to support the Sikorsky CH-53K

heavy-lift helicopter program, delivering the fuselage sections for the program's third and fourth prototypes on the System Demonstration Test Article (SDTA) contract. In October, Sikorsky successfully flew the first prototype. · We delivered to Boeing the first shipset destined for use on an operational KC- 46 aerial refueling tanker, an aircraft that will provide vital aerial refueling capability for the U.S. Air Force. · We began work on the first of eight Boeing P-8 aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force, while continuing deliveries of aircraft bound for the U.S. Navy.

Our ability to build military products on our commercial production lines saves time and money for governments and taxpayers and sets us apart from the competition. We are confident that our ability to design, build and deliver high-quality products at the lowest possible cost makes us a strong competitor for future defense programs. Business and regional jets. Business and regional jets continued to make up a small percentage of Spirit's business. In 2015, we celebrated Mitsubishi's success as the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) took its maiden flight in November. Spirit supplies the pylon for the MRJ, Japan's first new commercial jet in half a century.

Organization Changes. In 2015, we continued to add talent and experience to Spirit's senior leadership team. Krisstie Kondrotis joined Spirit to lead Business Development. Michelle Lohmeier joined the company to run Airbus programs, while John Pilla moved into the roles of chief technology officer and head of engineering. Duane Hawkins assumed leadership of Spirit's work on Boeing, Defense and Regional Jet programs; and Ron Rabe joined the company as SVP, Operations. Former Time Warner Cable CFO Irene Esteves was appointed to the Spirit AeroSystems Board of Directors.

In addition to making these leadership changes, we continued to recruit a pool of diverse and talented employees to help us prepare for future growth. Strategy in 2016. In today's aerospace market, competition is fierce, and complacency is not an option. That's why Spirit is always pushing to improve. In 2016, we will strive to: · Become more competitive by improving efficiency and reducing costs. We have invested in innovation and training to bring down costs on the Boeing 787 and 777 programs.

We will continue to implement cost -savings initiatives across the business, particularly in overhead, supply chain, and other support functions. · Invest in technology to improve quality and productivity. Meeting the demand for single-aisle aircraft will require a strong focus on quality and productivity. We will continue to invest in automation as we prepare to meet production rate increases on many of our programs. · Position ourselves for growth. Demand for
commercial aircraft remains strong. And in an uncertain world, the need for defense aircraft will continue for the foreseeable future. Both markets offer exciting possibilities for organic growth or acquisitions.

10 & Rising. A decade is a milestone worth celebrating, but Spirit's transformation as a global leader in the aerospace industry is still underway. During the next 10 years, we will continue to find new ways to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. The airplanes we design and build today will carry the next generations -- our children, our grandchildren and even our great-grandchildren -- to destinations around the globe. They, and millions of other travelers, will be counting on us. So we are committed to creating an enterprise that will last far into the future. Ten years is only the beginning.

In 2015, Spirit AeroSystems celebrated 10 years as a company. This milestone helped to define our history and set the stage for our future. Throughout the year, our employees in Kansas, Oklahoma, North Carolina, Scotland, France and Malaysia had the rare opportunity to show family members the factories and offices where visions become reality.

10 Years of Giving Back. Since 2005, Spirit employees and the company have donated more than $20 million to nonprofit organizations. In 2015 alone, employees and the company gave more than $4.8 million to charitable organizations, including United Way, Make-A-Wish, American Heart Association, Brain Tumour Charity (U.K.), local food banks, and a home for orphaned children. Team Spirit led the U.S. in Tour de Cure fundraising, contributing more than $161 ,000 to the American Diabetes Association. Spirit President and CEO Larry Lawson received national recognition from the ADA for his leadership and efforts.

Spirit also announced plans to provide $576,000 worth of scholarships for students enrolling in university engineering and business programs in Kansas. Volunteering. Last year, employees and their family members volunteered more than 10,500 hours of their time in service to their communities. Those activities included packing meals for hungry families, raising money for military veterans, and collecting thousands of dollars' worth of school supplies and holiday gifts for children. Clearly, giving back is a central part of the Spirit culture.
