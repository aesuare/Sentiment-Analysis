To Our Shareholders
In 1994, Southwest Airlines produced a profit of $179.3 million, a 16.2 percent increase over the $154.3 million of 1993, excluding the cumulative effect of 1993 accounting changes. Our net profit margin was 6.9 percent in a year when the domestic passenger carrier industry, as a whole, basically broke even.
In 1994, we also:
1. Completed negotiation of the launch contract for the Boeing 737-700 and the definition of our new aircraft to be received by Southwest beginning in fourth quarter 1997;
2. Completed negotiation of a contract for installation of Heads Up Displays (HUD) in the cockpits of our 737-300s, -500s, and -700s, providing greater landing and takeoff capabilities in adverse weather conditions, such as fog;
3. Acquired Morris Air and smoothly, successfully, and profitably integrated Morris into Southwest within nine months;
4. Including Morris, added seven new cities and introduced 30 percent more capacity to the Southwest system;
5. Designed, developed, tested, and prepared to go nationwide on January 31, 1995 with “Ticketless” air travel;
6. On an interim basis, after our ouster from Apollo and System One, introduced our own Southwest “CRS” (SWAT) for very high volume travel agencies and overnight ticket delivery for high volume travel agencies;
7. Introduced three-day Ticket By Mail for direct consumers;
8. Defined the functionality and negotiated a contract with American Airlines for entry into Basic SABRE, which, on May 1, 1995, will afford automated access to our Reservations System for 60 percent of our travel agency sales, and, we are convinced, produce lesser overall distribution costs for Southwest; while also providing our first direct, computerized access to the consumer through Easy SABRE and Commercial SABRE;
9. Negotiated a contract with the State of Arkansas and City of Little Rock and designed and built our 900-Agent Little Rock Reservations Center;
10. Negotiated and signed a collective bargaining agreement with the IAM covering 5,000 Reservation Sales and Customer Service Agents;
11. Negotiated a landmark Pilot contract with the Southwest Airlines Pilots’Association (SWAPA), fundamentally offering stock options in lieu of pay increases;
12. Sustained a year-long collision with Continental Lite, indirectly in Texas and directly on the Midway Airport-Cleveland-Baltimore axis of our system;
13. Met the United Shuttle assault head-on in California on October 1, 1994;
14. Won our third annual Triple Crown for best baggage handling; best ontime performance; and fewest Customer complaints per Customer carried;
15. Placed first in the Airline Quality Rating statistics; and
16. Operated 624,476 flights, carrying 42,742,602 Customers in perfect safety.

Our 1994 fourth quarter earnings of $20.3 million represented a 47 percent decline from the record $38.4 million of fourth quarter 1993. The principal causes for this decline were our own aggressive 30 percent expansion in Southwest’s capacity, as roughly 20 percent of our available seat miles were devoted to newly developing markets; Continental Airlines’repetitive “50 percent off” sales, which both deprived us of Customers and reduced yields per revenue passenger mile; and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of the United Shuttle in our Oakland markets. We also experienced a technological problem with our Reservations System, which has since been cured.
We presently expect the aftereffects of fourth quarter 1994 to persist through first quarter 1995, resulting in reduced load factors; lower yields; and substantially reduced earnings, as compared to first quarter 1994. As our most recent fare increases begin to take effect and our penetration of our new markets continues, we currently anticipate that our yields and load factors will begin to improve in the second quarter of 1995, with a hoped for full recovery occurring in third quarter 1995, barring any profound changes in the fortunes of the airline industry or of the economy. Our battle with the United Shuttle will continue in 1995, but we expect our California operations to be profitable for the year. Excluding fuel and profitsharing, we also are planning to reduce our 1995 operating costs per ASM below those of 1994.
In 1994, our People made an enormous investment in the future of Southwest Airlines. Only Southwest’s People could have effectively handled so much change so successfully. While a number of other airlines may attempt to imitate Southwest, none of them can duplicate the spirit, unity, “can do” attitudes, and marvelous esprit de corps of the Southwest Employees, who continually provide superb Customer Service to each other and to the traveling public. Just as the past has belonged to Southwest because of our People’s goodwill, dedication, and energy, so shall Southwest seize the future!
Most sincerely,
Herbert D. Kelleher Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer February 9, 1995
