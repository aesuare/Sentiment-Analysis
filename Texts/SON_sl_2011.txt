 SINCE 2006, SONOCO HAS AVERAGED
  To Our Shareholders
2011 PROVED TO BE A YEAR OF CHALLENGE AND CHANGE FOR SONOCO. We experienced an unexpected decline in industrial-related volumes late in the year. In addition, we faced escalating raw material, energy, freight and other costs during much of the year, and productivity was well below our historical standards. Despite these significant headwinds, Sonoco achieved record sales while attaining the second highest base earnings before interest and taxes, and third highest base earnings in Company history. Furthermore, we completed the acquisition of Tegrant Holding Corporation, which provides the Company with a new growth platform and establishes Sonoco as a leading provider of custom-engineered, multi-material protective packaging in North America.
Changing business mix: Consumer, Industrial
and Protective Packaging
Sonoco has remained a successful company for 112 years by adapting to changing market conditions. Yet our vision remains clear. We are aligned around serving our customers globally as one company delivering infinite packaging solutions.
For the past several years, we’ve diversified Sonoco’s business mix. Today, through acquisitions and new business development, we’ve grown our consumer- focused packaging and services businesses to account for approximately 54% of the Company’s sales and 58% of operating profits. We’ve pursued this strategy because our consumer businesses tend to be more recession resistant than our industrial-related businesses. Despite the cyclicality, our industrial businesses have obtained
global market share leadership and generated solid operating cash flow.
In November 2011, we further diversified Sonoco’s business mix by acquiring Tegrant for $550 million, the largest acquisition in Sonoco’s history. This was not a deal we just stumbled upon. The protective packaging industry serves a wide range of growing consumer and industrial markets and provides solid profit margins. Sonoco had already built a successful, yet relatively small, paper-based protective packaging business that primarily serves the appliance market. As a result of this experience, we made the decision to pursue a strategy of becoming a leading supplier of custom-engineered protective packaging. We were looking for the right opportunity and Tegrant met our criteria.
With this acquisition, Sonoco’s Protective Packaging segment has become the North American leader in fiber-based and expanded-foam protective packaging, temperature-assurance packaging and retail security packaging. In 2012, we estimate this new segment should produce sales of approximately $560 million,
and the acquisition is expected to be accretive to earnings. We believe this new business is not only complementary to our existing consumer and industrial businesses, but provides strong growth prospects in both domestic and international markets.

2011 results

   tions were key drivers and together accounted for more than 80% of the increase. Volume was up 1%, compared with 2010, but was largely offset by negative mix. Higher selling prices were principally driven by higher prices paid for raw materials.
For 2011, net income attributable to Sonoco was $217.5 million, compared with $201.1 million for 2010. Base earnings in 2011 were $233.6 million ($2.29 per diluted share), compared with $239.4 million ($2.34 per diluted share) in 2010. This 2% year-over-year decline was the result of a negative mix of business, higher labor and other costs, and a higher effective tax rate, partially offset by productivity gains and lower pension and man- agement incentive costs.
Gross profit margin decreased to 16.8%, compared with 18.6% in 2010. This decrease was primarily due to negative mix and the impact of inflation in labor and other costs more than offsetting productivity improvements.
The Company generated $245 million in cash from operations during 2011, compared with $375 million generated in 2010. The majority of the year-over-year
decline is attributable to higher 2011 pension contribu- tions partially offset by a smaller amount of cash used to fund working capital.
At the end of 2011, total debt was $1.3 billion, com- pared with $621 million at the end of 2010. The Tegrant acquisition, pension contributions and share repurchases were primarily responsible for the increase. The Com- pany’s debt-to-total capital ratio was 47.4% at the end
of 2011, compared with 29.2% at the end of 2010.
Cash and cash equivalents at year end 2011 totaled $175.5 million, compared with $158.2 million at the end of 2010. Standard & Poor’s ranks Sonoco as having the best debt rating in the packaging industry with an invest- ment grade rating of BBB+.
Consumer-focused growth
Consumer packaging preferences are changing, and as
a result, our customers’ needs have changed. Some of these changes are driven by economic conditions, but most are driven by consumers’ interest in what looks and feels improved. No longer can a packaging company only meet a single need of its customers. That is why Sonoco has worked to position itself as the industry’s only “total solutions” provider for consumer packaging and services.
Our unique offering starts with innovative packaging design available across our diversified line of consumer packaging products. We then are able to provide point- of-purchase displays as well as supply chain services and retail fulfillment. And finally, we offer the industry’s most complete sustainability services, including sustainable designs, packaging materials and recycling services.

CHANGING MIX OF BUSINESS
THE 2011 ACQUISITION OF TEGRANT
IS EXPECTED TO GROW REVENUES AND CHANGE THE FUTURE BUSINESS MIX OF SONOCO. THE COMPANY’S NEW PROTECTIVE PACKAGING SEG- MENT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE SALES FROM $158 MILLION, OR 4%, OF THE COMPANY’S REVENUES IN 2011 TO APPROXIMATELY $560 MILLION, OR 11%, IN 2012.

 needs of our customers, allows Sonoco to
create relationships that grow in collabo-
ration with our customers. For instance,
our Corporate Customer program, where
we place “one face” of senior account
relationship before our seven largest con- .90 sumer product customers, has continued
to build momentum. .60 Since starting our Corporate Customer
program in 2005, we have grown sales at .30 a compound rate of about 5% to nearly
$1.1 billion, or about 25%, of the Com-
pany’s total sales. 2011 was a very suc-

                 cessful year for this program as we increased sales by nearly $90 million. In addition, we were awarded several new packaging and services contracts during 2011 that will add about $55 million in new sales with these customers in 2012.
We’re also focused on working to meet consumers’ growing demand for private- label and store brand products.
In 2011, we generated approximately $165 million in private-label packaging sales, representing about 10% of our North American consumer packaging revenue.
Approximately 15% of our North
American composite can sales were used
in private-label products. The largest private-label growth in 2011 was through the conversion of coffee brands for lead- ing companies, including The Kroger Co., Mother Parkers Tea & Coffee, Reily Foods Company, Pan American Coffee Company and others, from metal cans to Sonoco compos- ite cans. These conversions increased composite can unit sales for coffee this year by nearly 35%.
Sonoco is also the only rigid plastic producer in North America to have significant operations in blow molding, thermoforming, injection molding and tube extrusion. Since 2005, we have nearly tripled sales in our rigid plas- tics businesses to approximately $620 million. This exceptional growth has come from acquisitions and new product development.
Over the past year, we added more than $75 million in rigid plastic sales growth for several well-recognized food and personal care brands. This growth will continue in
YEARS. IN 2011, THE COMPANY PAID APPROXIMATELY $115 MILLION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS.
2012, with the mid-year completion of a new $15 million blow-molding and injection-molding plant in Columbus, Ohio. This new 142,000-square-foot facility will produce packaging and components for personal care products for Mast Global, the sourcing and logistics division of Limited Brands.
In collaborating with our customers, we’re also leveraging our flexible packaging technologies into new products and new markets. For instance, we’re excited about a new steamer venting technology developed for frozen foods using our laser-scoring capability. Our precision die-cutting technology, used so successfully for cookies, was integrated into a new package for a cream cheese product and expanded into confectionery items.
Our Packaging Services segment, which includes point- of-purchase displays and global fulfillment solutions, is con- tinuing to add international sales as our customers move

operations to emerging markets. In 2011, international sales in this segment increased 37% to approximately $278 million with growth from service centers in Poland, Mexico and Brazil. We estimate that two-thirds of our Packaging Services sales will come from international markets in 2012, which is essentially the reverse of our domestic-versus-international sales mix just four years ago.
Industrial businesses focused on productivity
and cost reduction
Sales in our Paper and Industrial Converted Products segment were up 9% in 2011, almost entirely due to higher selling prices for recovered paper and exchange rates. Increased volume in reels and paper was offset by lower tubes and cores volume in nearly every region of the world due to weaker demand.
With many of our served industrial markets struggling, we are focusing on reducing our unit cost to produce and improving productivity. This is particularly important to our paperboard mills. That is why we made the decision to build a new biomass boiler system at our Hartsville, S.C., manufacturing complex.
The new boiler system will cost approximately $75 mil- lion and is expected to significantly reduce energy costs and improve reliability of operations. Powered by wood wastes from regional logging activity, the new cogenera- tion system will produce low-cost “green” energy and steam for our paper operations. Once in use in late 2013, the project is expected to reduce our annual operating costs by about $14 million.
Our Sonoco Recycling business was a strong earnings contributor in 2011 as we grew collections by 6% with an emphasis on expanding our residential material recovery facilities (MRFs). We now serve nearly 150 communities

Focused on the future
Entering 2012, we’re cautious about the future pace and sustainability of global economic improvement. We remain focused on continuing to implement targeted growth projects, particularly in our consumer-related businesses; fully integrating Tegrant, including achieving identified synergies; and continuing to drive cost out of our operations.
We also remain focused on creating shareholder value. Sonoco’s common shareholders have received
a total return of 59.9% (or 16.95% annualized) over the past three years. In 2011, the Company paid approxi- mately $115 million to our shareholders in quarterly cash dividends. Sonoco provides its shareholders with the largest dividend yield of any packaging company and has paid quarterly cash dividends since 1925, including 29 consecutive years of increased payouts.
In an era when many companies come and go, Sonoco has weathered the test of time. We are a mem- ber of the New York Stock Exchange’s elite Century Club, which represents 10% of NYSE U.S. listed companies that have been able to not only survive but thrive for more than 100 years. Building a company with nearly $4 billion in assets over 112 years has come from steady growth and an ability to change. Our future as a leading global packaging company is bright. We have built a solid foundation, and we are clearly focused on the future.
I join our more than 19,600 employees in thanking you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your investment.
