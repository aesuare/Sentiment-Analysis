 CHEVRON CORPORATION 1997 ANNUAL REPORT
To Our Stockholders
1997 was an outstanding
year for Chevron. Our record- setting income of $3.256 billion was up 25 percent over 1996, which had been the best year
in our history.
We surpassed our goal of $3 billion in earn- ings a year ahead of schedule. That goal and the others we’ve achieved have paid off for Chevron’s stockholders.
In 1997, our total stockholder return (dividends plus stock appreciation) was 22.1 percent. The average over the past nine years has been 19.2 percent, tops among our oil industry peers. Our return on capital employed (excluding special items) was 14.7 percent, bettering our 12 percent goal for the second straight year.
A key contributor to success
A major factor in our record year was the outstanding performance of Chevron’s U.S. refining, marketing and transportation opera- tions, which had their best year since 1988. Operating earnings of $662 million were more than double the 1996 level. Our strategy of emphasizing the value of the Chevron brand name, focusing on reducing costs and main- taining incident-free operations paid off in a strong market with higher gasoline demand and improved sales margins.
Additional measures of success
In the petroleum industry there are many important measures of success, and Chevron also has excelled in these. They include:
• Oil and gas production – At nearly 1.5 mil- lion barrels a day, production was the highest in 12 years. International production, where we’ve concentrated our efforts, climbed for the eighth straight year – up 4 percent over 1996.
Ken Derr, Chairman
 •
142 percent of the oil and gas it produced (excluding the effects of sales and acquisi- tions), making 1997 the fifth straight year that replacements exceeded production. Chevron has had the best reserves replacement rate among its peer competitors over the past five years. At year-end, worldwide proved reserves stood at nearly 6.2 billion barrels of oil and equivalent gas.
Saving money pays off
Reducing costs remains a major part of our strategy. Since 1991, we’ve cut annual oper- ating expenses about $1.8 billion. Moreover, 1997 was a breakthrough year. After three years of relatively flat per-barrel costs, we reduced our costs 7 percent to $5.68 a barrel. Overall, we reduced our cost structure by $400 million last year.
Building on success
Although both 1996 and 1997 were record- setting years, success is not a short-term phenomenon. Success is what you plan for and build on. Success comes as part of a con- tinuous cycle – opportunity, growth, success.
Underlying Chevron’s success is a solid, long-range plan. It’s this plan that helps us find, create and make the most of our oppor- tunities for our stockholders.

Worldwide opportunities abound
We’re looking forward to great growth oppor- tunities, including the following:
• Chevron has made two giant oil discoveries (Kuito and Landana) in deep water offshore Angola. Each field is estimated to hold more than 500 million barrels of recoverable oil. Chevron’s share is 31 percent. To the north, offshore the Republic of Congo, two new deep- water discoveries hold commercial promise.
• Deepwater areas also are promising in
the Gulf of Mexico, where first oil from our Genesis project is expected by year-end.
• The Hibernia project offshore Newfound- land is changing the economic scene in east- ern Canada. Production started in November, and peak production of 150,000 barrels a day is expected by mid-1999. Equally important, the enormous platform will be a hub for other potential production in the area.
• Production from a project in Venezuela’s Lake Maracaibo is forecast to exceed 100,000 barrels of oil a day in five years. At year-end, Chevron’s Boscan project was ahead of sched- ule and producing 89,000 barrels a day.
• In the North Sea, the platform for the Britannia gas field is in place, and production is scheduled to start this year.
• Chevron Chemical Company is building new plants in Singapore and Saudi Arabia, and is planning its first plant for China.
New opportunities abound in Caspian
Recognizing the enormous economic potential of the Caspian region, we have added a new strategy to our ongoing plan – to accelerate our earnings growth in the area. (See page 14.)
The oil potential of the entire region is enormous. Chevron already is a leading oil producer in Kazakhstan through its 45 per- cent interest in the supergiant Tengiz oil field. And we have an agreement to explore a deep- water area offshore Azerbaijan.
In February 1998, we signed an agree- ment with Shell to develop new exploration,

production and transportation projects in the Caspian area. With our combined strength, and working closely with the governments of the region, I believe we will be able to develop infrastructure and resources on a basis not previously contemplated. We want Chevron to remain the dominant company in the region.
Our new strategy also looks beyond oil and gas exploration and production. The countries in the region stand on the edge of rapid economic development, and we see the opportunity to help them progress. We have the possibility of expanding many aspects of our business and, at the same time, helping to generate wealth for the people and the coun- tries of the region.
Investing for the future
Our planned spending for 1998 – a record $6.3 billion – underscores our commitment to growth and our confidence in the tremendous potential of our worldwide projects. I believe that Chevron has better long-term growth opportunities than any of our competitors.
We plan to spend nearly $4 billion on worldwide exploration and production. Nearly $2.5 billion, or about 63 percent of that total, will be invested in international operations.

 CHEVRON CORPORATION 1997 ANNUAL REPORT
However, we’re still planning to spend a hefty $1.5 billion on U.S. projects, focusing on deep- water areas in the Gulf of Mexico.
Chevron plans to invest about $1.1 bil- lion in its worldwide refining, marketing and transportation projects. Nearly half of that,
or $600 million, will be spent in the United States. Finally, about $800 million is ear- marked for worldwide chemicals projects. Although the chemicals industry still is ham- pered by a cyclical downturn, we believe that it is near an end and that there are many attractive long-term investment opportunities.
Flexibility from financial strength Chevron’s balance sheet is the strongest it’s been in more than a decade. We’ve reduced debt more than $2.3 billion in the past
two years.
This financial strength gives us the flexi- bility to pursue important new opportunities. We recently created a mergers and acquisi- tions group to seek out promising business ventures, especially in exploration and pro- duction. In addition, we increased our divi- dend in the first quarter of 1998, the tenth straight year of dividend increases.
Financial strength and flexibility also help us maintain our focus when oil and gas prices drop. Right now, the short-term price outlook is not strong. Crude oil and natural gas prices started down in late 1997, and in the first quarter of 1998 oil prices hit their lowest level in nearly four years. Although we can’t control prices, there are important factors we can control – our costs, and pro- duction and sales volumes.
Safety, environment are key priorities
In 1997, we succeeded in implementing our “Protecting People and the Environment” program in nearly all locations worldwide. Chevron takes pride in its highly regarded record of environmental responsibility. Our policy, which is part of The Chevron Way, is stated at the beginning of this report.
Jim Sullivan, Vice Chairman
Employees share in success
Employees have an important stake in Chev- ron and benefit when the company does well. In January 1996, each employee was given 150 stock options that could be exercised when our stock price hit $75 a share for three consecutive days. This happened on June 17, 1997. In February 1998, during a worldwide employee teleconference, I announced a new stock option plan that will vest in two years. In addition, all employees are part of a Chev- ron Success Sharing plan that gives bonuses when specific operational, financial and safety goals are met.
Looking ahead to continuing success
Our talented, hard-working employees turn our strategies into the many successes we dis- cuss in this report, and I want to thank them for their efforts. I’m confident that they will continue to meet any challenge and carry out the plans for our many projects worldwide – building a stronger Chevron and providing superior value for our stockholders.
