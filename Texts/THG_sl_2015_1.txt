 THE HANOVER INSURANCE GROUP | 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
 From the Chairman
To Our Shareholders,
The Board of Directors is pleased to introduce The Hanover’s 2015 Annual Report. It is an honor for all of us to serve as directors of this great organization.
Over the last decade, our company has doubled in size while nearly doubling both its earnings and the value of its stock. During this same period, the company has returned more than $1 billion to its shareholders in the form of dividends and stock purchases and has increased its
book value per share by more than 80 percent. This success continued in 2015, with the company generating an 11 percent operating ROE and growing its domestic business above industry averages.
These financial and operational
gains have been driven by strategic investments in people and capabilities. As a result, we now have a company with an outstanding team of talented, dedicated leaders and insurance professionals at all levels of the organization. This team has built a broad, distinctive product portfolio

 THE HANOVER INSURANCE GROUP | 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
    and one of the best service and operating models in the industry.
Our success over the past 12 years has been directed by Fred Eppinger, our President and Chief Executive Officer. He came to The Hanover with a plan to transform the company from a small, regional property and casualty insurer with a failing life and annuity business to one of the country’s leading property and casualty insurance companies. Plainly put, he succeeded, and we are indebted to Fred for his exceptional service.
The Hanover is now a thriving organization, both domestically
and internationally, with a powerful distribution network, and strong business momentum. Our next CEO will inherit a company with a highly experienced and committed team, a culture of success and responsibility, and tremendous opportunities.
We believe in The Hanover’s future and we look forward to its continued growth and success.
