Fiscal year 2001 was both a challenging and exciting period for our company and for the industry. The transition from the current generation of game consoles to next generation systems continued, marked by the debut of the first entry in the next wave of new technology – the PlayStation®2 computer entertainment system from Sony. Nintendo and Microsoft will launch new platforms later this year, creating unprecedented levels of competition, creativity and excitement for consumers. Most importantly, this provides a unique opportunity for Electronic Arts to drive revenue and profit growth as we move through the next technology cycle. In conjunction with steady increases in the PC market, plus the significant new opportunity in online gaming, we believe Electronic Arts is poised to achieve new levels of success and leadership in the interactive entertainment category.
In FY01, consolidated net revenue decreased 6.9 percent to $1,322 million. As a result of our investment in building the leading Internet gaming website, consolidated net income decreased $128 million to a consoli- dated net loss of $11 million, while consolidated diluted earnings per share decreased $0.96 to a diluted loss per share of $0.08. Pro forma consolidated net income and earnings per share, excluding goodwill, non-cash and one-time charges were $6 million and $0.04, respectively, for the year.

We p l e d g e d t o b e c o m e the number one publisher on next generation consoles, number one on the PC platform, and the number one provider of interactive entertainment on the Internet. Our fourth key initiative is to be the number one “People Company” in the entertainment industry.

In total, we released fifteen new products for this system in less than a six-month period, making EA by far the most prolific publisher for the PlayStation 2 console. We led the best-seller charts with titles and franchises like M a d d e n N F L TM, N B A L i v e a n d S S X , o u r n e w s n o w b o a r d i n g g a m e .

We have announced support for both the XboxTM video game console from Microsoft and the Nintendo GameCubeTM, which will debut later this year. In summary, we succeeded well beyond our expectations on the PlayStation 2; we believe we are well positioned to succeed on Xbox and Nintendo GameCube; and we fully expect to achieve our goal of leadership on next generation consoles.

Strategic Initiative #2 – Leadership on the PC Platform On the PC platform we made tremendous strides. We grew market share by more than five points in North America, ending the March quarter in the number one position with a 21.6 percent share based on dollar sales. In Europe, we estimate we were the leading company for calendar 2 0 0 0 w i t h m o r e t ha n a 2 4 p e r c e n t s ha r e b a s e d o n d o l l a r s a l e s . I n A s i a P a c i fi c , w e e s t i m a t e w e l e d i n a l l t e r r i t o r i e s , and we moved to the number two market share position in Japan for the fiscal year. For the second year in a row EA published the number one title in the market – The SimsTM in calendar 2000 and SimCity 3000TM in calen- dar 1999. The Sims is a global phenomenon; it appeals to a very broad demographic of users, including men, women and children, along with both hard-core and casual gamers. We have sold more than four million units of the core product, and nearly seven million units total when you include expansion packs and data disks. It has become our most important wholly-owned intellectual property, and we plan to continue to develop this franchise with additional expansion packs and an online version in FY02. In addition, we had great success with products like Command & ConquerTM: Red AlertTM 2 and Black & WhiteTM, both of which have sold more than one million units worldwide to date.

Strategic Initiative #4 – Number One “People Company” in the Entertainment Industry We are on track to achiev- ing this goal. We know that industry leadership is predicated on attracting and developing the best talent. We s t r i v e t o c r e a t e a n e n v i r o n m e n t w h e r e p e o p l e w a n t t o w o r k a n d w h e r e g r e a t c a r e e r s a r e r e a l i z e d .
W he n it come s to r e c r ui t in g t a l ent , w e are w i del y r ec ogni zed f or c omb i ni ng an i nn ova ti v e web - b as ed strategy with a “high touch” approach. In just over a year, the career site on our corporate home page has registered more than 50,000 candidates, forming a private talent pool for EA’s ongoing recruitment.
We must also retain our best people. We’ve developed EA University to enhance our technical and man- agement skills. Our proprietary Emerging Leader Program provides management insight and broad business skills to employees who show potential for next generation leadership. We’ve also launched an innovative c r o s s - f u n c t i o n a l p r o g r a m w i t h t h e M a s s a c h u s e t t s I n s t i t u t e o f Te c h n o l o g y. T h e C r e a t i v e L e a d e r s h i p P r o g r a m brings academics and developers together in workshops on narrative, art, and design. In addition, we listen to our people through our Talk Back organization feedback process, which allows us to stay in touch with the ever-changing needs of our workforce.
These highlighted efforts coupled with industry-leading compensation and reward practices, value-based management practices, and the most up-to-date work environments, are making us a #1 People Company.

Historically, the console market has grown by 50 percent or more with each new generation of technology. By most estimates, the next generation of 128-bit machines could develop an installed base of more than 200 mil- lion systems worldwide. More hardware units translate into more software sales. Also, as gameplay, graphics and audio improve to match the enhanced technology, software tie ratios (the number of software units sold per hardware system) are likely to increase in the future. These are all clear indications of organic growth in our industry.
As new entries from Nintendo and Microsoft heat up the competition in console gaming, and as online g a m i n g c o n t i n u e s t o g r o w , E A’ s p r i m a r y g o a l w i l l b e t o e x p a n d o n t h e m a r k e t l e a d e r s h i p w e a c h i e v e d i n FY01. Within our industry, EA’s scale allows us the unique ability to leverage intellectual properties across mul- tiple platforms and publish them around the globe.
EA’s fundamental strategy is based on creating new hits and innovative products. In FY01, titles like The S i m s a n d S S X a l o n g w i t h o u r l i n e u p o f f r a n c h i s e s u n d e r o u r E A S P O R T S TM b r a n d – M a d d e n N F L TM, F I F A S o c c e r , N H L ® , NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR®Golf, Triple Play Baseball,TM Formula One, Knockout KingsTM and NASCAR®– inspired loyal consumers and drew new audiences to the fun of video games. In FY02 we will release a full slate of potential new hits including NBA STREET, James Bond 007...Agent Under FireTM, Pirates of Skull CoveTM and the first in a series of multiple products based upon the Harry PotterTM property, which EA has licensed exclusively for the video game category.
This strategy of hits and innovation will usher in a new age of video gaming. As our core consumers mature and younger gamers enter the market, we’re also seeing greater numbers of women drawn to our products. As technology improves and gameplay adopts deeper story lines and character development, the evolution of video games is accelerating. Interactive entertainment has truly become mainstream entertainment. EA intends t o r e m a i n a t t h e f o r e f r o n t o f t h i s e x c i t i n g a n d r a p i d l y e x p a n d i n g i n d u s t r y.
