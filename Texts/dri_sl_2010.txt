   To Our Shareholders, Employees and Guests: the end of fiscal 2010 marked the 15-year anniversary of Darden’s June 1995 spin-off from General Mills as an independent, publicly traded company. Fiscal 2010 was also another year, like the preceding two, in which economic and consumer conditions were challenging.
During difficult times, it is tempting to hunker down and take comfort in focusing narrowly on the day to day. Darden’s rich history consistently reminds us, however, that long-term perspective and planning is critical. as we look back over our past 15 years, we understand that long-term success depends on finding the right balance between continuity and change. We would like to share some highlights from fiscal 2010, then review, as we begin our next 15-year journey, where you can expect continuity and where we believe there will be a need for change.
Fiscal 2010 Financial Highlights
although absolute results from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 were below our long-range targets due to the challenging economic and industry environment, our performance was nevertheless competitively superior.
•   Sales from continuing operations were $7.11 billion, a  1.4 percent decrease from fiscal year 2009’s $7.22 billion.  Excluding an additional fiscal week in fiscal 2009, which contributed approximately $124 million in sales, total sales  increased approximately 0.3 percent in fiscal 2010.
•   Total sales results from continuing operations reflect a  combined u.s. same-restaurant sales decline for Olive Garden, red lobster and longhorn steakhouse of
2.6 percent, which was 2.3 percentage points better than the 4.9 percent decline in the Knapp-trackTM benchmark of u.s. same-restaurant sales, offset partially by incremental sales from the net addition of 51 restaurants.
•   Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 were  $407.0 million, a 9.5 percent increase from net earnings  from continuing operations of $371.8 million in fiscal 2009.  Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 were $2.86, a 7.9 percent increase from  diluted net earnings per share of $2.65 in fiscal 2009. 
•  I n fiscal 2010, net losses from discontinued operations  were $2.5 million, and diluted net losses per share from  discontinued operations were $0.02, related primarily to  the carrying costs and losses on the remaining properties held for disposition associated with smokey Bones and Bahama Breeze closings from fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2008.  Including losses from discontinued operations, net earnings were $404.5 million in fiscal 2010, 8.7 percent above net  earnings of $372.2 million in fiscal 2009. Including losses  from discontinued operations, diluted net earnings per share were $2.84 in fiscal 2010 compared to $2.65 in  fiscal 2009.
•   Olive Garden’s total sales were a record $3.32 billion, up  1.0 percent from fiscal 2009, despite one less fiscal week. This reflected average annual sales per restaurant of  $4.7 million, the addition of 32 net new restaurants and a  u.s. same-restaurant sales decline of 1.0 percent (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks), which was 3.9 percentage points favorable to the Knapp-track competitive benchmark.
•   Red Lobster’s total sales were $2.49 billion, a decrease of  5.3 percent from fiscal 2009, which included the extra fiscal week. Average annual sales per restaurant were $3.6 million  and u.s. same-restaurant sales for fiscal 2010 fell 4.9 percent (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks), which was equal to the decline for the Knapp-track competitive benchmark.
•   LongHorn Steakhouse’s total sales were $882 million, a  decrease of 0.7 percent from fiscal 2009, which included  the extra fiscal week. This reflected average annual sales  per restaurant of $2.7 million, the addition of 10 net new  restaurants and a u.s. same-restaurant sales decline
of 1.9 percent (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks), which was 3.0 percentage points favorable to the Knapp-track competitive benchmark.
•   The Capital Grille’s total sales were a record $242 million, a  3.2 percent increase from fiscal 2009, despite one less fiscal week. Average annual sales per restaurant were $6.2 million,  three new restaurants were added and same-restaurant sales declined 7.8 percent (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks). 
•   Bahama Breeze’s total sales were $130 million, down 
1.0 percent from fiscal 2009, driven by one less fiscal week and a same-restaurant sales decline of 2.9 percent (52 weeks vs. 52 weeks), which was offset partially by the addition of one new restaurant. average annual sales per restaurant were $5.4 million.

Darden’s Next 15 Years –
Where You Can Expect Continuity
OUR HUNGER FOR SUCCESS
During the past 15 years, we have aspired to be a winning organization financially, which we define as delivering competitively superior sales and earnings growth that produce a top quartile s&p 500 total return for our shareholders. and we’ve looked to make Darden a special place to be, one where our people are fully engaged because Darden offers them an opportunity to fulfill their personal and professional dreams.
Fiscal 2010 capped off 15 years of strong financial results. From our 1995 spin-off through the end of fiscal 2010, Darden’s annualized total shareholder return was 13.7 percent. That is  significantly higher than the 11.0 percent return over that period for the 75th percentile of the S&P 500, putting your Company  solidly within the top quartile. the last 15 years was also a period of measurable success making Darden a special place, one where people feel they matter. that is evident in our employee engagement survey results. For employees at every level of the Company, results on each of our last three surveys have been well above corporate norms, and our results have consistently improved with each survey. In short, Darden’s shareholders and employees have been well served by our desire to create a winning organization financially and a special place to be. these objectives and our definitions of success for them will not change going forward.
A VIBRANT AND RESILIENT INDUSTRY
Over the past 15 years, we have clearly benefited from operating in a vibrant and resilient industry. One way the full-service restaurant industry’s inherent strength shows through is in how well it has held up the last few years compared to other customer-related categories.
the industry’s vibrancy and resilience are grounded in what we believe are three durable dynamics. First, many consumers are reluctant to cut restaurant visits and spend more of their day shopping for groceries, preparing and cooking meals and cleaning up, even during periods of economic softness. second, a significant number of dining out occasions are more than functional experiences – they include entertainment or other emotional dimensions as well. third and equally important, when consumers consider the cost of the most convenient dine-in alternatives to dining out – the ready-to-heat items in the supermarket – dining out is not dramatically more expensive. With its inherent strength, we are confident the restaurant industry will continue to offer Darden the opportunity to create leadership-level returns for you, our shareholders, and personal and professional growth opportunities for the people who choose to invest their careers with your Company.
A PROVEN STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK
at Darden, our framework for building great brands is to combine brand management excellence with restaurant operations excellence, and to support those brands with an ever more robust and cost-effective operating platform. We define brand management excellence as the ability to create well-defined, relevant and differentiated brand promises. restaurant operations excellence is the ability to deliver on those brand promises with great guest experiences in our restaurants. Guided by this framework, not only have we delivered a top quartile s&p 500 total shareholder return over the past 15 years, we have also performed at competitively superior levels within our industry on the most important

OUR LONG-TERM SALES AND
EARNINGS GROWTH TARGETS
Given the strength of the full-service restaurant industry, our brand-building expertise and our brand support platform, the long-term sales and earnings growth targets we established for the Company five years ago continue to be appropriate. Our goal is to sustain long-term annualized sales growth of 7 percent to 9 percent and translate that into diluted net earn- ings per share growth of 10 percent to 15 percent. this is the opportunity effective multi-brand operators have in the full- service restaurant industry over the long term. and we are excited that, with the modest improvement in economic and industry conditions that we and others expect, fiscal 2011 will be a year when we can return to our long-term range for earnings growth and approach our long-term range for sales growth.
Darden’s Next 15 Years – Where You Can Expect Change
OUR EVOLVING BRANDS
Our portfolio of brands is different today than 15 years ago, which reflects several new brand launches, dispositions and  acquisitions along the way. While we do not know how the portfolio will differ 15 years from now, we suspect it will indeed be different. What we do know, though, is each of our current brands is meaningfully different today than in 1995. and each brand will be much different 15 years from now as each continues to evolve to remain in sync with its guests’ changing needs and expectations. Both red lobster’s brand refresh initiative and longhorn steakhouse’s “roadhouse” to “ranch house” transition are illustrative of this. In each case, there have been meaningful changes in what and how we serve our guests, with more changes to come – including an acceleration in the physical remodeling of restaurants.

     OUR BRAND-BUILDING EFFECTIVENESS
We are very good brand builders today. as our world and our industry continue to change, we must become even better brand builders tomorrow. that means change. an example may help. For a brand to realize its full potential, not only does it have to maintain relevance for current guests and current dining occasions, it must become relevant for new guests and new occasions. Capturing these kinds of new opportunities takes considerable work today, and we believe our Company has not been doing enough of that work. the challenge has been that too often the daily and quarterly promotional and operational intensity of our business crowds out focus on important new brand- and sales-building opportunities that have long lead times. to provide dedicated time and attention for these opportunities, we have embarked upon a compre- hensive redesign of our Marketing organization. the initial phase, which began in fiscal 2010, includes the creation of a Chief Marketing Officer position at the enterprise level, and more changes will follow in fiscal 2011. With the increasing pace of change among consumers and the increasing competitive intensity of our industry, we recognize further changes in our approach to enhance brand-building effective- ness will be essential in the years ahead.
OUR BRAND SUPPORT PLATFORM
With scale and financial and professional resources that are unmatched elsewhere in the full-service restaurant industry, Darden consistently invests in great people and innovative systems in critical support areas. these areas include our supply chain, where our investments provide global presence and market contacts that help us purchase on a competitively cost-advantaged basis and stay ahead of market price fluctuations. They also include talent management, where  our investments help us build brands and sustain a strong culture. and they include information technology, where we invest to develop and continuously enhance cost-effective in-restaurant labor and food cost management systems and capabilities.
With this type of ongoing investment, our brand support platform is considerably more effective and efficient than
it was 15 years ago and we are confident that 15 years from now it will be even more robust. several examples are illustrative of the journey ahead. to achieve more consistent and cost-effective restaurant manager training and development, we launched an enterprise-level learning Center of Excellence in fiscal 2010. It combines and builds upon important brand support work previously done separately within each brand. We also made significant progress in fiscal 2010 further automating our supply chain, reducing usage of energy, water and cleaning supplies in our restaurants and centralizing management of our restaurant facilities. together, these efforts resulted in $18 million of cost savings in fiscal 2010,  and we expect them to save $65 million to $75 million a year  when fully implemented. similar changes in how we operate have been crucial to our past success; they will be just as important in the future.
Conclusion
We operate in a vibrant and dynamic industry. the challenge is determining where to change and where to stay the course. We have had tremendous success over the 15 years since the spin-off from General Mills. as we look forward, we are confident we will continue to strike the right balance between continuity and change, enabling continued progress in building a great company, now and for generations. In short, we think Darden’s best is yet to come.
