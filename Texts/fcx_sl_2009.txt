The year 2009 was one of extraordinary accomplishments for our Company. In the face of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, our global team responded in an aggressive fashion to offset the impact of low copper and molybdenum prices, to strengthen our financial position and to preserve our future growth options.
Weak market conditions, which began in late 2008, required us to make difficult but necessary decisions to enable us to manage volatile conditions and position us for a bright future for our Company. The theme of this year’s annual report, “Proven Performance — Shining Future,” captures the demonstrated performance of our team and the optimism we have for the long-term future of our business and the values of our assets.
We are pleased to report the successful execution of our operating plans during 2009. We exceeded our production targets for both copper and gold and achieved significant reductions in our cost structure. Our Grasberg operations in Indonesia, one of the world’s largest and best performing copper and gold mines, once again demonstrated its strength — achieving multiple operating and financial records. Our North America operations successfully executed major initiatives to reduce costs to maintain profitability under weak market conditions. Our teams in South America were successful in implementing a number of cost reduction initiatives and efficiency improvements. In Africa, we completed construction of one of the world’s most modern copper and cobalt mining facilities, which is expected to be a source of high-grade ore and low-cost production for decades to come.
We were also successful in adding to our reserves, continuing an
important accomplishment of our team over an extended period of time.
At December 31, 2009, our estimated total proven and probable reserves approximated 104 billion pounds of copper, 37 million ounces of gold and 2.6 billion pounds of molybdenum. At current production levels, we have more than a 25-year reserve life and are optimistic that we will continue to
be successful in adding to our reserves in the future. Exploration will continue to be a key feature of our Company and a driver of our future plans.
Mining revenues from copper sales approximated 75 percent of our total 2009 revenues. During 2009, copper was one of the best performing metals, with its price rising over 150 percent, as strong demand from China and limited supply offset weak conditions in the developed economies of the United States, Europe and Japan. The future of copper is bright,
  We have always recognized that the Grasberg mine (pictured above) would be our cornerstone asset during times of low commodity prices.
We are pleased to report the successful execution of our operating plans during 2009.

underpinned by limited new supply, the depletion of currently producing mines, the important role of copper in the development of emerging economies’ infrastructure and the fundamental requirements in the world’s developed economies. We are in a strong position as one of
the world’s largest copper producers to benefit from the very favorable fundamentals of the copper marketplace.
We generated strong financial results in 2009, which enabled us to strengthen our financial position and enhance our liquidity. We repaid $1 billion in debt during the year, reducing our $17.6 billion of debt at our 2007 acquisition of Phelps Dodge by a cumulative $11 billion.
As we progress, we are preparing for eventual improvement in conditions in the world’s developed economies, which will be highly favorable to the demand for our products. We have an attractive portfolio of potential investment opportunities within our existing asset base and are prepared to move forward as market conditions warrant.
With current copper prices above $3 per pound, gold prices above $1,000 per ounce and molybdenum prices over $15 per pound, we would generate significant cash flows. We will continue to invest in attractive growth projects and maintain our strong balance sheet.
Our environmental management and community development programs are important to our success. We will continue to invest in the communities where we operate and aggressively manage to mitigate the environmental impacts of our operations.
The safety of our workforce is our highest priority. Our programs are designed to achieve a safe environment for all our workers. Our comprehensive Working Toward Sustainable Development report,
Copper Price

which is available on our web site, reflects a strong commitment to our sustainability programs.
We congratulate and express our appreciation to our entire organization for their extraordinary accomplishments during the year. Their enthusiasm and perseverance during challenging times is a testament to their dedication and positive spirit. We appreciate the wise counsel of our Board of Directors, whose support has guided us through challenging market conditions. All of us working together have achieved the “Proven Performance” reflected in our annual report and have made possible the “Shining Future” for our Company and our shareholders.
