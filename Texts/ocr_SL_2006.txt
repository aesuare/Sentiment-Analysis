                                        To Our Fellow Shareholders
  The year 2006 was one of the most extraordinary periods in Omnicare’s 25- year history. While the year was filled with significant change, most notably with the introduction of the Medicare Drug Benefit, and some unexpected challenges, we never lost sight of our mission to provide exceptional pharmaceutical care to the seniors we serve. Our service and our mission were uninterrupted.
We believe that, even in the face of significant challenges, the fundamentals underpinning our business and our organization are strong. Despite the year of transition and the difficult issues we faced, our Company remained focused on successfully integrating the NeighborCare, RxCrossroads and excelleRx acquisitions and on achieving sales and adjusted earnings growth for the year.
The Year in Review
Net sales in 2006 reached $6.5 billion as compared with the $5.3 billion reported in 2005. Net income was $183.6 million as compared with $226.5 million, and diluted earnings per share were $1.50 versus $2.10 for the 2006 and 2005 years, respectively. After adjusting for special items and the impact of a change in accounting
related to contingently convertible securities, our adjusted net income reached $328.0 million versus $265.9 million in 2005, with adjusted diluted earnings per share reaching $2.68 versus $2.48 in the prior period.
Operating cash flow reached $108.5 million in 2006 as compared with $263.5 million in 2005. The 2006 cash flow was impacted by two government
settlements and litigation expenses totaling $104.2 million and by $12.5 million related to Heartland repackaging matters, partially offset by the return of a $38.3 million deposit from one of the Company’s drug wholesalers. Cash flow from operations for 2005 was impacted by the $22.9 million cash portion of special items.
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the full year 2006, including special items, was $600.0 million versus $602.0 million in 2005. Excluding special items, 2006 adjusted EBITDA was $794.5 million versus $629.7 million in 2005.
During 2006, the Company repaid $109.0 million in debt and, at December 31, 2006, had $141.8 million in cash on its balance sheet. Our total debt to total capital at December 31, 2006 was 48.5%, down approximately 280 basis points from December 31, 2005.

Omnicare, Inc.
Uncompromising
No matter the industry con- ditions or operating environ- ment, Omnicare is uncom- promising in its commitment to the health and well-being of the nation’s seniors.
In line with its objective to enhance the ability of health- care professionals practicing in long-term care to provide quality pharmaceutical care
in a cost-effective manner, Omnicare released its 14th edi- tion of the Omnicare Geriatric Pharmaceutical Care Guidelines®. The Omnicare Guidelines® first ranks drugs based solely on clinical effective- ness, specifically for seniors, and only then on relative cost. All clinical recommendations in the Omnicare Guidelines® are made
by the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia exclusively for Omnicare and are peer-reviewed by practicing healthcare profes- sionals and academicians across the nation. Moreover, the Omnicare Guidelines® has been consistently reviewed and recom- mended by the American Geriatrics Society.
As the Omnicare Guidelines
  
                                        2006 – A Transition Year
Clearly 2006 was a year of transition for us and our entire industry. The implementation of the Medicare Drug Benefit, arguably the most significant change in the history of Medicare, brought with it numerous administrative and payment issues as more than 40% of our revenues shifted to this program. We remain proud of the efforts of our employees and the high level of preparedness we achieved as an organization. With a change of this magnitude, however, not all issues could be anticipated and addressed prior to implementation, particularly the many issues that developed outside of the control of the Company. Nonetheless, despite this unprecedented change in payor systems, we delivered on our promise to continue to provide needed pharmaceuticals to the residents of our client
facilities without interruption. It was not without cost, however.
During 2006, we incurred
approximately $27 million pretax, or 14 cents per diluted share, in incremental, transitional expenses to work on resolving the numerous administrative, payment and operational issues arising out of the Part D implementation.
focuses on both health benefits and cost, it enables physicians to make the best clinical choices of drug therapy in a manner that is cost-efficient for payors. Given the weight of the medical evi- dence and pharmacoeconomic considerations provided by the Omnicare Guidelines®, it also serves as the foundation for a broader array of proprietary clin- ical programs, including a num- ber of disease management ini- tiatives, designed to achieve the best health outcomes in both quality and cost.
Moreover, our working capital needs increased substantially due to the volume of rejected claims and inappropriately assessed co-pays that resulted from this transition. While progress was made during the year, we are continuing to work diligently with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Prescription Drug Plans (PDPs) administering the Part D benefit to resolve these issues and work toward a smoother operating environment.
In addition to administrative issues under Medicare Part D, we also faced structural issues, such as those relating to our lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group and its affiliates (United). Our results for the year were impacted by a unilateral reduction by United in reimbursement rates paid to Omnicare under its pharmacy
network contract for services rendered to beneficiaries of United’s drug benefit plans under Medicare Part D. The differential in rates resulting from United’s action reduced 2006 sales and operating profit, beginning in April 2006, by $68.2 million, or approximately 35 cents per diluted share. We initiated litigation regarding this matter, which is

Also during 2006, we experienced certain quality control, fire damage and
environmental issues at one of our
repackaging operations, Heartland Repack Services. As a precautionary measure, we voluntarily suspended operations and subsequently decided not to reopen the Heartland facility. In February 2007, we reached an agreement with the Repackaging Services division of Cardinal Health, Inc. to become our contract repackager for the repackaging volumes previously produced at Heartland. We view this as a very favorable alternative to opening a new repackaging facility, as we believe it will restore our repackaging capacity more quickly and efficiently.
In spite of the distractions surrounding the implementation of Medicare Part D and the Heartland repackaging issues, as well as dealing with various regulatory matters, we continued to execute on our planned strategic objectives, including the integration of the NeighborCare, RxCrossroads and excelleRx acquisitions, achieving solid financial results and planning for our future.
Integration of Acquisitions
The acquisition of NeighborCare, Inc., completed in July 2005, represented the largest acquisition in our history, increasing the number of beds we served by 27% and our annualized revenues by 36%. Importantly, this transaction provided enhanced scale, stronger resources and significant
synergies from greater purchasing efficiencies, elimination of redundant expenses and consolidation of operations in overlapping geographies.
Upon the closing of the acquisition, we immediately embarked upon an aggressive integration plan, and this major initiative has now been successfully completed. In addition to the realization of purchasing leverage and the elimination of redundant overhead expenses, we recently completed the planned consolidation of 70
pharmacies, comprising approximately 198,000 beds. Altogether, we are pleased with the strategic as well as financial contribution of this major acquisition.
An important part of our growth strategy has also been to broaden our growth platform by entering adjacent markets. For example, in August 2005, we acquired RxCrossroads, a leading provider of specialty pharmacy services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, generally for high-cost drugs used in the treatment of chronic disease states. Its financial performance was excellent in 2006. As important, RxCrossroads allows us to offer a full spectrum of services – from drug discovery to commercialization – which presents Omnicare with a larger opportunity to capitalize on the growing trend in the development of biopharmaceuticals.
At the same time, we acquired excelleRx, the nation’s leading provider of pharmacy services for the rapidly growing hospice market and an emerging participant in the disease management

It, too, had an outstanding year in 2006, achieving strong growth in its hospice census and progress in its medication therapy management services provided under certain federal disease management demonstration projects.
Both RxCrossroads and excelleRx represent attractive opportunities to leverage our core assets and skill sets in high growth and capital-efficient businesses.
Pharmacy Services Business
Our pharmacy services business reached record sales of $6.3 billion in 2006, up from
$5.1 billion in 2005. Adjusted operating profit of $748.5 million in 2006, also a record, was up from $595.3 million in 2005. At year-end 2006, we served long-term care facilities comprising approximately 1,406,000 beds.
Sales growth for the full year in the pharmacy services business was largely attributable to the acquisitions of NeighborCare, excelleRx and RxCrossroads, all of which were completed during the third quarter of 2005, as well as the ongoing execution of our acquisition strategy, a favorable payor mix shift (offset in large measure by the reduction in reimbursement rates under the United Part D contract) and drug price inflation. This growth was tempered somewhat by a marked increase in the use of generic drugs, competitive pricing and a lower number of beds served, along with a bed mix shift and the full-year effect of prior-period Medicaid reimbursement reductions.
Even with the temporary constraints on planned
revenue and cost savings initiatives in our institutional pharmacy business brought about by the Heartland repackaging issues and the complexities associated with the transition to Medicare Part D, our adjusted operating margins in 2006 were higher than in 2005. We believe this performance reflects, among other factors, the progress we made throughout the year with the integration of NeighborCare as well as other acquisitions and in realizing anticipated cost savings, along with the impact of increasing availability and utilization of generic drugs.
Contract Research Business
Our contract research businesses (CRO), including Omnicare Clinical Research and Clinimetrics, recorded revenues on a GAAP basis of $171.9 million as compared with $182.4 million in 2005. Reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses in 2006 and 2005 totaled $25.6 million and $28.5 million, respectively. Excluding such reimbursable expenses, adjusted CRO revenues for the full-year 2006 were $146.2 million as compared with $153.9 million in 2005. Adjusted operating profit in 2006 was $7.7 million versus $12.4 million in 2005.
While the full-year 2006 results reflect a somewhat difficult year, the reorientation of our CRO business model, along with tight control over variable expenses, began to produce improved results late in the year. Revenue growth reached its highest quarterly level of the year in the fourth quarter of 2006 and backlog reached an all-time high of $301.9 million at December 31, 2006 which

Omnicare Full Potential Plan
Ours is a scale business. Omnicare, given its size, is uniquely positioned in the industry to take advantage of scale and efficiencies. Accordingly, last July we announced the Omnicare Full Potential Plan, a major initiative designed to re- engineer the operating infrastructure in our institutional pharmacy business to increase efficiency and enhance customer growth.
The Plan is designed to optimize resources across the organization through a three-pronged approach:
Best Practices to include implementation of new standard operating procedures as well as the realignment and right-sizing of functions in preparation for “hub and spoke” consolidation; Hub and Spoke to include the transfer of key administrative and support functions and the consolidation of production functions into hubs, where they can be more efficiently managed with dedicated resources, specialization and automation. Resources concentrated at our pharmacies will focus on time-sensitive and customer-facing processes; and
Net Customer Growth to include the optimization of service delivery and the redesign of customer-facing processes and organization to provide more opportunities for customer interaction and satisfaction.
We believe the Omnicare Full Potential Plan, a
30-month program, will generate pretax savings in the range of $100 million to $120 million annually
upon completion of the initiative. Reductions in inventory and other working capital are projected to generate $50 million to $100 million in cash by the completion of the program. Restructuring charges over the course of the program are expected to total approximately $80 million, so we see the payback here as attractive. Equally important, however, is the potential we see to enhance the net growth in our customer base. Not only will our operations be more efficient, but our pharmacy staff will be able to focus extensively on exceptional customer service, retention and growth.
2007 – A Building Year
If 2006 was a transitional year, then we see 2007 as a building year – one in which we work to resolve prior challenges and move ahead toward those activities that will improve future performance and enhance shareholder value. First, we are working diligently to restore our centralized repackaging capacity as quickly as possible under our new arrangement with Cardinal Health. This will allow us to pull out costs in many areas and redirect resources to other growth initiatives. And, we are focused squarely on overall growth, both through increasing our customer base in long-term care as well as in adjacent markets where our core competencies can be leveraged and our opportunities broadened.
We will also be working to maximize free cash flow to deploy in acquisitions, debt reduction, or other uses of cash that drive shareholder value. This includes working to resolve many of the administrative and payment issues surrounding

Unchanged
Supported by demographics and the macro trends in healthcare, Omnicare’s growth strategy remains unchanged. As the senior population continues to grow, so does Omnicare’s opportunity to ensure their health and well-being as well as its own.
Today, nearly 40 million Americans are age 65 years and older. As the baby boom generation ages, that number is expected to grow to 55 million by 2020 and reach 80 million by 2040. Moreover, pharmaceuticals remain the safest and most cost-effective means of treating the chronic
ailments of the elderly. Consequently, the growing senior population means a greater demand for Omnicare’s services.
Omnicare will continue to seek growth opportunities by leveraging its core pharmacy business through clinical and information services and by expanding its presence into adjacent markets. Then, too, Omnicare is uniquely positioned in its industry to take advantage of scale and efficiencies, as evidenced by the launch of the
  
                                        Part D, both on a retrospective and a prospective basis. No question, this is a high priority for us as we seek to reduce our expenses as well as working capital needs. Moreover, we, the PDPs, CMS, our client nursing facilities and Congress are all one year further along the learning curve regarding the benefits and pitfalls of this sweeping new program. We look forward to working constructively with all parties to effect an operating system that works more efficiently and one that truly provides seniors the pharmaceutical care they need and deserve.
Lastly, we are keenly focused on the implementation of the Omnicare Full Potential Plan. We believe this major new program, in many respects, presents long-term solutions to the issues we face today. It is premised on the fact that we are a scale business, it capitalizes on our unique advantages in driving change in our industry, it reduces costs and it addresses how we may enhance customer growth.
Bottom-line, we believe that our strategy of leveraging growth in our core pharmaceutical distribution business through the development and expansion of clinical services, our vigilance in managing costs and our focus on maximizing cash

flow will continue to enable us to deliver value for residents, payors, clients, partners and shareholders.
Uninterrupted
The year 2006 was Omnicare’s 25th year in business. Our unique 25-year history has provided two lessons learned that are central to Omnicare’s growth and ability to deliver shareholder value. First, healthcare is an industry marked by constant change as the nation grapples with managing the quality of healthcare and managing its costs. Adaptability is key. Second, it is important to take the long view. Omnicare has endured
and grown because we act for the long-term sustainability of our Company. By keeping this foremost, Omnicare has been able to weather all types of industry conditions and continue to create long-term value for its stakeholders.
Last, we would like to thank all of our employees for their extraordinary efforts in 2006 and for not losing sight of the fact that the health and well- being of people across the nation depend on what we do every day. And, we would like to thank our shareholders for their patience and support. Our entire organization is committed to enhancing the value of your investment.
