 DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
CURIOSITY IS ONE OF HUMANKIND’S MOST BASIC AND POWERFUL TRAITS. It’s why children reach out to touch flowers or feel the rain. It inspires artists, explorers and entrepreneurs and takes scientists to breakthroughs that foster human progress. Passionate curiosity guides Discovery’s global portfolio of 200 networks and more than 50 brands. Today, Discovery is the #1 pay-TV programmer in the world with more brands on more platforms than any other media company. It leads to the powerful stories and engaging characters that reveal what’s beyond the clouds, beneath the sea and at the frontiers of human experience.
Those stories and characters resonate with a growing, worldwide audience that wants to learn something new, satisfy its boundless curiosity about the universe and KEEP ON DISCOVERING. That’s why Discovery’s strategy of investing in high-quality content that can be enjoyed around the globe, across every platform, continues to be
so successful, even in a world of rapid economic, technological and social change.
In 2013, record financial results once again underscored the power of this strategy as Discovery’s domestic
and international viewership continued to grow at a remarkable pace. Not only did our newer brands like OWN, Destination America and Velocity set new records, but also our established brands got stronger with Discovery Channel, Animal Planet and ID all having their most-watched years ever in key demos. This past year alone, the company launched 17 new international feeds, offering more localized content, scheduling and languages, which makes our networks more attractive to viewers, advertisers and affiliates. In addition to the organic growth across our unmatched global footprint, the company also created additional value and further strengthened its long-term growth profile with the acquisition of SBS Nordic and a partnership in Eurosport.
GLOBAL CONTENT INVESTMENT DRIVES GROWTH
In 2013, the company invested more than $1.4 billion in programming content across its global portfolio.
This strategy translated into viewership gains worldwide, enabling Discovery to increase both market share and revenue. Building on last year’s momentum, strong performances by original series translated into nearly 12% total market share in the U.S. and over 20% viewership growth internationally in 2013, which built on the growth the company delivered in each of the last four years.
Discovery also expanded its global content portfolio with key investments abroad including the acquisition of
SBS Nordic and an equity stake in Eurosport, the largest pan-European sports platform. Full year revenues of $5,535 million were up $1,048 million, or 23%, compared to the full year a year ago, led by 51% growth at International Networks and 7% growth at U.S. Networks. Operating income increased by 8% to $19,998 million and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) grew 16% to $2,425 million, driven by a 35% increase at International Networks and a 5% increase at U.S. Networks. Adjusted OIBDA is defined and a reconciliation to operating income is presented in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Segment Results
of Operations” section of the attached annual report on Form 10-K.

DRIVING INTERNATIONAL
WHILE U.S. INVESTMENTS ARE DRIVING MARKET SHARE GAINS AND SUSTAINED FINANCIAL MOMENTUM, THE COMPANY’S UNMATCHED INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO, INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOCAL EXPERTISE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER EXPANSION AND LONG-TERM GROWTH. In 2014, Discovery Networks International marks its 25th anniversary since the initial launch of Discovery Channel in the United Kingdom and Nordic countries. Discovery’s distribution pipeline now averages eight networks in over 220 countries and territories, and the company continues to capitalize on the organic growth of pay-TV services in markets around the world as well as the burgeoning demand for content across multiple screens. Pay-TV penetration across the entire international portfolio increased double-digits in 2013 led by 17% growth in Latin America and nearly 20% growth in Asia Pacific. The strength and local feel of the network brands, together with significant subscriber gains, resulted in viewership growth of 22% across the international portfolio in 2013. Audience gains have been very broad based with double-digit increases across nearly every region led by Italy and Spain in Western Europe, Mexico and Brazil in Latin America and Russia and South Africa in the CEEMEA region. Ad sales grew 23% this past year, excluding acquisitions, building on the 19% growth delivered in 2012.
In addition, Discovery is supporting strong organic growth with targeted acquisitions and partnerships that expand its unmatched global portfolio, diversify the content mix, and deepen its footprint across some of the most stable TV markets in the world. In 2013, the company completed the integration of SBS Nordic, a top-three portfolio of TV networks that feature the best of nonfiction, scripted and sports programming. Discovery also forged a partnership in Eurosport, the leading pan-European and pan-Asian sports platform. Combining Eurosport’s brands and audience reach with Discovery’s network portfolio, boots on the ground and country-specific expertise creates an unrivaled and powerful offering for viewers, advertisers and affiliates.
