To Our Shareholders: Fiscal 2006 was a significant year for Agilent in its transformation to a focused pure-play measurement company. After completing the sale of its semiconductor products business, the company divested its semiconductor test business and launched Verigy as an independent company. Agilent also completed a $4.4 billion stock repurchase program and announced a new plan to repurchase up to an additional $2 billion in shares through 2008. The first phase of Agilent's transformation is complete. The company is now organized into two business groups: electronic measurement, which includes general purpose test and communications test; and bio-analytical measurement, which includes chemical analysis and life science. In 2007 Agilent's focus will be on ``Phase II'' of its transformation, with the intent to achieve higher sustainable, profitable growth by leveraging the operating model that has been created. Specific initiatives for organic growth include micro arrays, high-end liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, diagnostics and informatics in bio-analytical measurement; and aerospace-defense, communications test, low-cost instrumentation and nanotechnology in electronic measurement. Organic growth will be supplemented by targeted acquisitions. With a new focus on the $40 billion measurement market, Agilent is committed to be the measurement partner of choice for engineers and scientists throughout the world. The company now serves a less volatile and more profitable market that can create enormous value for shareholders. As Agilent continues its transformation over the next 12 months, there continue to be significant opportunities to accelerate growth and strengthen the company's position as the world's premier measurement company.
