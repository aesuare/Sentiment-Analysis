 04 AutOlIv 2010 / President's letter
A Record Year
2010 was a record year for autoliv. Our company sur- passed several previous records, such as:
• 6% higher sales than 2007
• 31% higher earnings per share than 2006
• 18% higher operating cash flow than 2007
• 12% operating margin compared to 10% in 1997
these records reflect our swift restructuring efforts, which significantly reduced our Company’s cost base and helped transform our Company's global footprint to take advantage of the dramatic shift that global light vehicle production (lvP) has undergone since 2007.
shifts in Global lVP
In 2010, the global lvP rebounded from its precipitous drop to an annualized run rate of only 45 million at the low point of the crisis and reached a record high of nearly 72 million vehicles.
While the 2010 lvP level exceeded its 2007 pre-crisis peak, the geographical mix has changed dramatically, as illustrated by the graph below. lvP has dropped by nearly 20% in Europe, North America and Japan (“the triad”) where we used to gen- erate more than 80% of revenues. this decline was more than offset by the Rest of the World (RoW) where lvP has increased by more than 50%. the markets in China and India stand out by increasing lvP by 109% and 66% compared to the 2007 levels.
to take full advantage of the growth opportunities primarily in China, India and thailand, we are allocating more than 60% in our expansion-related capital expenditures to our growth markets, even though these markets “only” accounted for approximately 20% of sales in 2010 (despite the very rapid sales increases in recent years). Additionally, we have made acquisitions to strengthen our position in Asia and with the local Asian vehicle manufacturers (see “Stronger than ever” on the next page).
As a result, Autoliv now has virtually one third of sales in each of our three regions Europe, North America and Asia including Japan. At the end of 2010, China accounted for 13% of sales compared to 4% in 2007. Consequently, not only has Autoliv's geographical sales mix become better balanced, but we have improved our Company's position in areas where lvP is expected to grow the most over the next few years.
company Transformation
We initiated our action program already in July 2008. We were therefore well positioned to expand and accelerate the program when the crisis fully developed after the lehman Brothers bank- ruptcy in September 2008.
this enabled us to adjust headcount by nearly 10,000 or close to 25% already within nine months. these adjustments
continued during 2009 and 2010 in high-cost countries (HCC), particularly for indirect personnel in overhead functions, to maintain and improve the cost reductions we had achieved. Despite these substantial headcount reductions, we launched a new R&D project (for small car safety) in the midst of the crisis.
In parallel with the decrease of permanent employees in HCC, we expanded in low-cost countries (lCC), particularly in direct manufacturing personnel, to ensure that Autoliv would be well prepared for the rebound of these markets. In summary, we reduced headcount in HCC by 21% and expanded headcount in lCC by 26% from the 2007 levels.
As a result, Autoliv had 63% of total headcount in lCC at the end of 2010 compared to 52% at the end of 2007. In addition, 20% of headcount were temporary personnel and 30% were indirect personnel in overhead functions compared to 16% and 34%, respectively. this gives us more flexibility, an even better presence in the fastest growing markets, and a significantly better cost structure with a lower break-even point.
Reduced cost Base
Following this transformation, we estimate that Autoliv can reach its break-even point at a sales level that is approximately $0.8 billion lower than since the crisis.
this is mainly due to lower labor costs. In relation to sales, we have reduced these costs by nearly 4 percentage points (see graph). However, this not only reflects our restructur- ing actions and strategic moves to lCC but also includes productivity improvements of 6% in manufacturing in every year during 2008–10, which is in line with our target of at least 5% per year.
Another major improvement in our cost structure is the reduction in depreciation due to plant closures in high-cost countries. New manufacturing capacity required in response

  “ In conclusion, Autoliv has emerged as one of the winners from the crisis; stronger a”nd more efficient than ever
to the increased lvP has been concentrated in lCC, where the costs for buildings and machinery are lower and where less capital-intensive manufacturing processes and automation can be used.
Furthermore, the record operating margin in 2010 of 12.1% would not have been achieved had we not been able to reduce our component cost below 52% of sales again from 52.4% in 2008. this has been a challenge due to the continuous squeeze between the sales price erosion on our products and increas- ing raw material prices. We have managed to offset these trends primarily by localizing component sourcing to lCC, standardizing products and components, and by developing more efficient suppliers.
“stronger than ever”
Our improved market position and cost structure have resulted in a very healthy cash flow. this has led to a record strong bal- ance sheet and to Autoliv regaining its long-term credit rating of “BBB+”. It has also allowed our Company to resume dividend payments to shareholders and to drive industry consolidation through several strategic transactions.
Since the third quarter 2009, we have invested a total of $168 million in acquisitions to accelerate Autoliv's growth and strength- en our Company by fully integrating subsidiaries. the acquisitions are expected to add $570 million in consolidated sales over a 12-month period, despite the fact that some of the acquisitions were minority interests in already consolidated subsidiaries.

At the end of 2009, we acquired Delphi's European and North American assets for airbags, steering wheels and seatbelts and, during 2010, Delphi's remaining assets in Asia for passive safety.
Also in 2010, we acquired the remaining shares in our Esto- nian subsidiary Norma (which is the leading automotive safety supplier for the Russian market) and in our Japanese inflator company. Additionally, we made two smaller strategic acquisi- tions in active safety: visteon's automotive radar business and Delphi's pyrotechnic safety switch business.
In conclusion, Autoliv has emerged as one of the winners from the crisis; stronger and more efficient than ever.
Quality in all Dimensions
After our record year of 2010, you may ask: What is your next step? My answer is simple: superior quality and expansion in ac-
tive safety.
Quality has always been paramount in the automotive indus-
try, especially for safety products. lately, the vehicle manufac- turers have become even more quality focused, partially due to a few highly publicized vehicle recalls. this has significantly increased the number of vehicles recalled, and the trend is likely to continue as vehicle manufacturers introduce even stricter quality requirements.
We have not been immune to this trend as we have recently been involved in recalls (see page 29). However, as a technol- ogy leader we are determined to meet these challenges and make stricter quality requirements an even stronger competitive edge for our Company. therefore, already in mid-year 2010, we launched a proactive quality initiative, called “Q5 - Quality in all dimensions” (see page 28), to further enhance our leadership and reemphasize the importance of quality.
Growth in Passive safety
We expect demand for airbags and seatbelts in passive safety to continue to grow, thanks to increasing global lvP, strong consumer demand for safer vehicles, new regulations and crash-test rating criteria.
For instance, side curtain airbags for head protection will become mandatory in 2013 in all light vehicles sold in the u.S. In addition, by 2017, the side curtain airbags will be required to prevent occupants in the u.S. from being ejected in roll-overs, according to a new regulation announced at the beginning of 2011. Furthermore, Brazil has decided to mandate frontal air- bags in all light vehicles by 2014, and Europe is in the process of phasing-in a tougher EuroNCAP crash rating test program.
these examples show that automotive safety continues to be a priority of governments all over the world. this bodes well for our company and its long-term growth prospects. For the next three years, we expect our main market for passive automo- tive safety to grow at an average annual rate of approximately 6%, based on the lvP forecast from the market institute IHS.
Expansion in active safety
the next step in automotive safety is active safety systems that can prevent an accident or, at least, reduce the speed and the
severity of impact. In 2010, we stepped up our investments in this area, primarily by increasing our R&D by more than $40 million. these projects now represent more than 10% of our total gross R,D&E expense.
We see very strong growth trends in our sales of radar, night vision and vision cameras, and the potential in active safety is significant as this new market continues to expand and migrate to new product lines and new technologies. Consequently, we are stepping up our undertakings in active safety, which is the principle reason for our plans to increase gross R,D&E expense in 2011 by almost $70 million.
Outlook 2011
Since we are approaching maximum capacity utilization in man- ufacturing facilities in our growth markets, we recently initiated a three-year capital expenditure plan. this plan calls for seven plant extensions or new plants in China, India, Brazil, Poland and thailand. As a result, in 2011, we expect to increase capital expenditures in the range of $300 and 350 million or around 4% of sales compared to $236 million or 3.3% of sales in 2010.
In 2011, the market forecasting institute IHS expects lvP to grow globally by 5% on average, mainly due to an 8% growth in the Rest of the World. In Western Europe, where the safety content per vehicle is relatively high, IHS expects lvP to in- crease by less than 1%. Despite the fact that this regional mix is unfavorable for the auto safety market, we expect Autoliv’s organic sales to grow faster than global lvP or at a rate of ap- proximately 6% during 2011. this is explained, primarily, by an expected continued positive vehicle model mix for our Company and a strong order intake in prior years.
Currency effects are expected to add 3% to revenues, pro- vided that the mid-February exchange rates prevail, while the remaining annualized effect of acquisitions from 2010 should add 2% to the 2011 full-year sales. We therefore expect consoli- dated sales to grow by more than 10% and achieve an operating margin of at least 11.5%.
the fact that Autoliv should be able to report double-digit margins for two consecutive years immediately after the worst crisis in the history of the automotive industry is a testimony to our employees’ hard work and dedication to customer commit- ments. For this I would like to extend a sincere “thank you” to all of them. During very difficult times, they built a solid foundation that now yields these excellent results.
Yours sincerely,
Jan Carlson
