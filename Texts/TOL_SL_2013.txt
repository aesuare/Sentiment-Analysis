Toll Brothers 2013 7

DEAR SHAREHOLDER,
With the housing recovery gaining momentum, FY 2013 was a year of significant growth for
Toll Brothers. Our revenues rose 42% to $2.67 billion; our contracts grew 42% to $3.63 billion; our backlog increased 57% to $2.63 billion; and our pre-tax income improved 137% to $267.7 million. Our revenues were the highest since FY 2008; our year-end backlog was the highest since FYE 2007; and our contracts were the highest since FY 2006. The price increases that we have been instituting in many communities over the past year, combined with the acceleration in sales paces per community and efficiencies from our high-volume home production systems, translated into strong revenue and earnings growth. In our fourth quarter, revenues jumped 65% to $1.04 billion -- the first time that we've exceeded $1 billion in revenues in 24 quarters. Our 36% increase in unit home deliveries in the fourth quarter resulted from our continuing focus on increasing production to meet the surge in our backlog. In the fourth quarter, our gross margin, excluding write-downs and impairments, and our operating margin improved to 25.4% and 12.3%, respectively, compared to 24.6% and 8.3% in FY 2012's fourth quarter. In addition to our solid home building results in FY 2013, our wholly owned Gibraltar Capital and Asset Management subsidiary, which focuses on the acquisition and value maximization of distressed real estate loans and assets, generated approximately $16 million in pre-tax income, while we produced approximately $37.5 million of pre-tax income from our other joint ventures and ancillary businesses, as well as other items. In this recovery, our focus on the luxury market and "long land" strategy of controlling sites in affluent locations is serving us well. Upscale buyers want to live in neighborhoods with quality schools and convenient access to employment centers, major cities, and cultural institutions. They are willing to pay a premium for this lifestyle. With approved sites for luxury homes still in short supply nationwide, our well-located communities, coupled with our highly respected brand, helped drive our pricing power in FY 2013: The average price of deliveries this fourth quarter was up 21% to $703,000, and the average price of homes in FYE backlog rose 10% to $715,000 compared to one year ago. We started FY 2013 very strong, building on the sales momentum of FY 2012. Buoyed by historic low interest rates and significant pent-up demand, we raised prices and accelerated per-community home sales paces as the housing market continued to rebound. The value of FY 2013's first nine months' contracts rose 35% in units and 49% in dollars

With the housing recovery gaining momentum, FY 2013 was a year of SIGNIFICANT growth for Toll Brothers. Our revenues rose 42% to $2.67 billion; our contracts grew 42% to $3.63 billion; our backlog increased 57% to $2.63 billion; and our pre-tax income improved 137% to $267.7 million.

8 Toll Brothers 2013

Supported by our well-LOCATED land portfolio, strong financial position, broad product diversification, and industry-leading brand, we believe that FY 2014 will be a year of further revenue growth, margin improvement, and increased profitability for Toll Brothers.
compared to the same period in FY 2012, which was up solidly -- 43% and 54%, respectively -- versus FY 2011. Buyers seemed to digest the price increases that accompanied the stepped-up sales volumes through our first three quarters of FY 2013. In our fourth quarter, the impact of those price increases, combined with uncertainty from Washington's political discord and a sudden rise in interest rates, contributed to a leveling of demand. In our fourth quarter, contract growth was 6% in units and 23% in dollars versus FY 2012's strong fourth quarter, which was up 70% in units and 75% in dollars versus FY 2011's same period. We believe that this leveling of demand, which, as we write this, has persisted through the first six weeks of our FY 2014 first quarter, will prove temporary based on still-considerable pent-up demand, the gradually strengthening economy, a robust stock market, and the improving prospects of our affluent customers. We believe that the housing industry is still in the early stages of recovery and that Toll Brothers, and the publicly traded home building companies in general, still have substantial room for growth. New home production remains well below volumes needed to meet current demand, not to mention the pent-up demand of the last six years. The economy, while improving slowly, is far from fully recovered. In 2013, national housing starts, although projected to be up significantly from 2012, will still be well below the average of the last 40 years, despite an increased population. Based on historical ratios comparing new home construction to population and households, as well as based on normalized housing production over the past 40 years, our industry has been dramatically undersupplying the market since 2008. A shortage of approved home sites, labor constraints in some markets, and a lack of available capital for small and mid-sized privately owned builders, are still constraining supply. In the luxury market, this shortage could lead to a further escalation in home prices above and beyond normal trends until industry production returns to its historic equilibrium. In FY 2013, we increased our land position by 20% from one year ago to approximately 48,600 home sites, a total that will increase again in the coming months. We bought land in nearly all of the 19 states in which we operate and strategically expanded our product lines into a number of key markets in FY 2013. In the metro urban New York City market, we made some timely Manhattan condominium site acquisitions and began construction of our first urban rental project, a 38-story jointventured tower in Jersey City, New Jersey, a 5-minute train ride to Wall Street. We introduced our already established active-adult brand to the western United States with a new community in the Denver suburbs. In Texas, we acquired several major master plans in fast-growing Houston and reentered the Austin market with a large acquisition as well. In the Maryland and Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., we made several well-positioned land acquisitions and entered the metro urban D.C. market with both condo and rental apartment projects. And in Boca Raton, Florida, we acquired the former Royal Palm Polo Club, on which we plan to offer 223 homes at an average sales price of between $1.2 and $2 million. Most significantly, in early November 2013, we announced the acquisition of Shapell Homes of California for $1.6 billion. Shapell has a long and illustrious history as one of California's largest and most successful land development and home building companies in the coastal markets of Northern and Southern California. This acquisition provides us with California's premier large-scale land portfolio, consisting of approximately 5,200 entitled home sites in affluent, high-barrier-to-entry markets: the San Francisco Bay area, metro Los Angeles, Orange County, and Carlsbad. We expect the deal to close in early 2014.

Our strong balance sheet and ready access to capital helped fuel our growth in FY 2013 and remain a major competitive advantage. We ended FY 2013 with $826 million of cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet and an additional $1.46 billion of liquidity through our various committed bank credit facilities. We are focused on maintaining the financial flexibility that has enabled us to weather the recent unprecedented downturn and then expand opportunistically as the recovery has unfolded. This flexibility allowed us to enter Seattle in November 2011, as the market began to recover, through our acquisition of CamWest and, more recently, to expand our presence in California through our upcoming acquisition of Shapell. It also has allowed us to grow our apartment development business over the last two years with four projects totaling approximately 1,500 units currently under development and approximately 4,000 additional units in the pipeline. During FY 2013 and into the start of FY 2014, we have raised over $3.2 billion via corporate and joint venture project financings while maintaining our current credit ratings, which were reaffirmed by all three agencies in early November after our announcement of the Shapell acquisition. This acquisition will be paid for with the proceeds from our November 2013 $230 million stock issuance, the $600 million of 5- and 10-year debt we also raised in November in the public capital markets, and a planned future draw of approximately $800 million on our preexisting $1.035 billion long-term line of credit. Upon completion of the Shapell transaction, with our additional cash on hand and supplemental already committed credit facilities in place, we project that we will still have in excess of $1 billion of available liquidity for growth. Supported by our well-located land portfolio, strong financial position, broad product diversification, and industry-leading brand, we believe that FY 2014 will be a year of further

revenue growth, margin improvement, and increased profitability for Toll Brothers. Our community count, including the additions from our acquisition of Shapell, should increase from 232 communities at FYE 2013 to between 250 and 290 by FYE 2014. Based on our FYE $2.63 billion backlog of 3,679 homes, projected pace of future sales, and cancellation rate, which is the lowest among the publicly traded builders, we anticipate delivering between 5,100 and 6,100 homes in FY 2014. At an average home price of between $670,000 and $720,000, this would translate to revenues of between $3.42 billion and $4.39 billion in FY 2014, an increase of 28% to 64% over FY 2013. And we look forward to continuing to expand our land position and spreading our brand across our product lines and diversified markets. We thank our shareholders and home buyers for their support. We thank our capital providers, our suppliers, and our subcontractors for working with us. And we thank and express our deep admiration for the tremendous group of colleagues with whom we work at Toll Brothers. Their commitment to providing our buyers with the finest quality and service propels us forward and makes Toll Brothers a unique place to work and a unique company on which our customers can rely to build the homes and communities of their dreams.
