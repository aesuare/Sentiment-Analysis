FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
2000 was a strong year for Sempra Energy. During the course of the past 12 months, we have seen tangible results from three years of effort to develop a diversified energy services company outside of our two regulated California utilities.
We exceeded our financial goals for the year, increasing overall earnings per share by approximately 20 percent — surpassing our three-year-average target of 8- to 10-percent annual growth. We returned a dividend consistent with our mix of delivery and growth businesses. Amidst the turmoil of California’s energy crisis, we even main- tained strong investment-grade credit ratings — no small achievement.
2000 was the year in which our intellectual capital began to bear fruit; a year in which the company accomplished what it set out to do.
We expanded our wholesale energy trading and retail energy marketing businesses and developed generation assets to support them. We continued pursuing new opportunities both in the United States and abroad. We also assumed a leadership role with respect to the ongoing energy crisis in our home state. I will address this impor- tant issue in greater detail later in this report.

 STEPHEN L. BAUM CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT & CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Sempra Energy

We stated that we would realize one-third of earnings from our unregulated businesses by 2003.
EXPANDING OUR HORIZONS When Sempra Energy was formed in 1998, our vision was to become a new kind of energy company — able to deliver integrated products and services demanded by today’s customers and an evolving energy marketplace. To accomplish this, our unregulated businesses, under the Sempra Energy Global Enterprises umbrella, work hand-in-hand to leverage our strengths in the retail marketplace to deliver the most value.
Today, I am pleased to report that this strategy is succeeding, with 18 percent of our earnings last year coming from unregulated businesses. We are on track toward meeting our goal of deriving one-third of our earnings from these businesses by the end of 2003.
Led by the success of Sempra Energy Trading, our newer businesses expanded in 2000. Our wholesale trading operation is a key driver of Sempra Energy’s retail strategy, providing the trading, hedging and risk-management capabilities necessary to execute complex energy transactions. It provides sophisticated solutions that few others in the industry can match.
Sempra Energy Resources also enables our retail strategy, through the acquisition and development of generation. Its power production gives Sempra Energy a natural hedge against unanticipated and severe fluctuations in mar- ket prices and demand — and the assurance that we can follow through on our commitments. This generation also provides a strong profit potential in volatile energy markets.
Sempra Energy Solutions, our retail energy services business, provides an integrated suite of energy products and serv- ices to commercial and industrial customers in the four regions of the United States with the highest energy demand.

 SEMPRA ENERGY’S GROUP OF UNREGULATED BUSINESSES COMPRISES A WIDE SPECTRUM OF DISCIPLINES WITHIN THE ENERGY MARKETPLACE, INCLUDING WHOLESALE ENERGY COMMODITY TRADING, ELECTRIC GEN- ERATION, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ENERGY SERVICES, INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES.
Sempra Energy Global Enterprises
 
Over the course of the past year, our unregulated businesses increased to 18 percent of earnings from one percent, putting us well ahead of our four-year growth target.
 
 “IN 2000, WE WITNESSED THE STAGGERING PACE OF CHANGE, CHALLENGE AND OPPOR- TUNITY IN THE ENERGY MARKETS SEMPRA ENERGY TARGETS. WE ARE PROUD TO SAY WE HAVE RESPONDED SUCCESSFULLY.”

Sempra Energy International, together with its Mexican partner, Próxima Gas, S.A. de C.V., expanded its Mexican gas distribution properties in Mexicali, Chihuahua and La Laguna-Durango and this year will commence construction of a major natural gas pipeline across northern Baja California. Sempra Energy International will continue to balance its portfolio of companies among existing businesses with continued high growth potential in Argentina, Chile and Peru. The company also continues to develop new gas distribution projects in Mexico and Canada that are beginning to demonstrate their overall potential.
Finally, with information technology a central element for developing new and innovative products and services, Sempra Energy’s technology ventures are providing more information, more control and more solutions to increas- ingly sophisticated customers.
I invite you to read on for a more detailed explanation of our operational successes.

We stated that our trading operations would achieve net income of $15 million and expand in key world markets.
POWERING GROWTH The emerging competitive energy market favors the kind of business that can apply strong intellectual assets to complex problems. Indeed, the largely entrepreneurial activity of energy-commodity trading requires just the right mix of customer-relationship building, energy experience and financial expertise.
With more than 1,200 customers, including virtually every major oil and natural gas company in North America and Europe, Sempra Energy Trading has become one of the industry’s leaders.
In 2000, in addition to realizing net income of $155 million, our trading business reached two important opera- tional milestones. First, Sempra Energy Trading significantly expanded in Europe, opening three new offices to complement its existing natural gas and power-trading activities in London, Norway and Germany. It established a crude oil and refined petroleum products trading business in Geneva, and took advantage of Spain’s evolving electricity market by opening operations in Madrid. The company also expanded to Singapore, focusing on the petroleum and refined petroleum product markets.
Second, Sempra Energy Trading built a stronger presence in power trading worldwide. This was due, in part, to the volatility in global energy markets. The company now maintains a round-the-clock power-trading operation.

 ACTING AS A CRITICAL LINK IN THE MARKETPLACE BETWEEN TOP ENERGY PRODUCERS AND USERS, SEMPRA ENERGY TRADING PROVIDES COMPETITIVELY PRICED NATURAL GAS, ELECTRICITY, CRUDE OIL AND PETROLEUM PRODUCTS TO A BROAD RANGE OF CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE.
Sempra Energy Trading
 
In 2000, Sempra Energy Trading netted $155 million, more than eight times its 1999 earnings.
 
 “OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IS BASED ON CREATIVITY, PERSISTENCE AND A STAUNCH COMMITMENT TO MEETING OUR CUSTOMERS' RISK-MANAGEMENT NEEDS.”
— David A. Messer (left), President, Sempra Energy Trading. Pictured with Jacqueline Mitchell, Managing Director, Sempra Energy Trading.
None of these achievements would have been possible without the company’s customer-driven approach and its disciplined emphasis on quality and profitability rather than quantity. Sempra Energy Trading focuses its operation and takes pride in the fact that it has a value-at-risk (VaR) index that is among the lowest in the industry — meaning that the company has few equals in maintaining a low-risk trading portfolio.
Sempra Energy Trading continues to develop. It is looking to expand its activities into new areas — including the trading of liquified natural gas, where it already has significant expertise. With the volatility of the energy markets not expected to change materially in the near term, Sempra Energy Trading should continue to enjoy healthy earnings in 2001.

We stated that we would develop or acquire generation to support our overall growth strategy.
THE NEXT GENERATION As the energy market evolves, many commercial and industrial customers demand direct access to generation. Sempra Energy Resources is building a comprehensive generation business around this demand, supporting the activities of Sempra Energy’s retail marketing and wholesale trading operations.
Just one year ago, Sempra Energy Resources had one plant under construction and several others on the drawing board. Today, its 500-megawatt (MW) El Dorado Energy plant near Las Vegas — a joint venture with Reliant Energy — is operating, while three other projects in the Southwestern United States have successfully completed their major permitting requirements.
This activity is significant, especially in light of the severe power shortages in the Western United States and rapid growth in Northern Mexico. Sempra Energy Resources’ goal is to be part of the solution to the region’s energy problems, providing critically needed new investment in increasing the power supply.
The company expects to break ground later this spring on the 1,200MW Mesquite Power plant in Arizona and the 550MW Elk Hills Power plant near Bakersfield, California. Also, Sempra Energy Resources will break ground on a 600MW facility in Mexicali, Mexico, later this year. The Mexicali plant will be able to supply power to both sides of the border, and is being built to meet California’s strict air-quality standards.
10.
 
 IN SUPPORT OF THE SEMPRA ENERGY GROUP OF COMPANIES, SEMPRA ENERGY RESOURCES IS CHAR- TERED WITH ACQUIRING, DEVELOPING AND OPERATING A NEW BREED OF POWER PLANTS THAT UTILIZE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE CLEAN, EFFICIENT GENERATION.
Sempra Energy Resources
 
In 2000, Sempra Energy Resources brought online one of a new breed of U.S. merchant power plants, and advanced three additional projects toward the construction phase.
 
 “WITH STRONG MARKET GROWTH, ACCESS TO MULTIPLE MARKETS, AND FUEL AND TRANSMISSION COST ADVANTAGES, WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO BE AMONG THE MOST COMPETITIVE GENERATORS OF ELECTRICITY.”
— Michael R. Niggli, President, Sempra Energy Resources
These new power plants employ state-of-the-art technology at least 30 percent more efficient than that used in today’s aging plants, many of which are unable to keep up with rising electric demand and more rigid air-quality standards. The new plants have other, distinct advantages as well. Mesquite Power is ideally situated next to the Palo Verde hub and switchyard, offering direct access to the voracious Arizona and California power markets. And, because the Elk Hills project is a joint venture with Occidental Petroleum, it offers Sempra Energy Resources the significant financial advantage of being able to use “on-site” natural gas without being subject to normal border- delivery charges for gas.
Sempra Energy Resources has been successful in rapidly transforming itself from a small start-up operation two years ago into what will be a supplier of almost 4,000 new megawatts of electricity by the end of 2004.
 11.
 
We stated that our retail energy services business targeting regional commercial and industrial markets would show dramatic revenue growth.
SOLUTIONS OF CHOICE In 2000, Sempra Energy Solutions made great strides in delivering new integrated, packaged and outsourced solutions to the commercial and industrial marketplace — from generation solutions for power-intensive Internet data centers to cost-saving energy-usage plans for computer chip manufacturers. In the process, the group met and surpassed its stated financial targets for the year.
Unlike the energy environment of just 12 months ago, in which customers wished to lock in lower prices before those prices began to rise, today’s environment places a higher demand on new, money-saving systems. Sempra Energy Solutions — by providing both supply-side services that can generate greater revenue and demand-side consulting that can lower costs — is building a reputation for delivering answers to its customers’ precise needs.
In 2000, Sempra Energy Solutions signed several key contracts, including a $31 million deal with TrizecHahn. Sempra Energy Solutions will own, operate and provide energy services for the new $567 million Hollywood & Highland entertainment and retail destination being developed in Los Angeles by TrizecHahn. At the State University of New York at Stony Brook, Sempra Energy Solutions is optimizing the university’s energy system, which serves 7.5 million square feet.

 AS THE PRINCIPAL RETAIL-MARKETING SUBSIDIARY OF SEMPRA ENERGY, SEMPRA ENERGY SOLUTIONS PRO- VIDES A BROAD SPECTRUM OF ENERGY-RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TARGETED AT COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES IN FOUR U.S. REGIONS — THE WEST, NORTHEAST, UPPER MIDWEST AND GULF COAST.
Sempra Energy Solutions
 
In 2000, Sempra Energy Solutions’ revenues more than doubled to $380 million over 1999 — fast growth that defined it as an energy partner, not just a provider.
 
 “OUR APPROACH IS SIMPLE: WHERE WE HAVE REGIONAL STRENGTH AND TARGETED INDUSTRY EXPERTISE, WE GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS GREATER CONTROL OF COMMODITY PRICING AND ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE.”
— Robert N. Dickerman (right), President, Sempra Energy Solutions. Pictured with Erbin B. Keith (left) and Gary Hessenauer, both Senior Vice Presidents of Sempra Energy Solutions.
Last year, we agreed to sell our 72.5-percent stake in mass-market retailer Energy America to Centrica, plc for $56 million. Energy America sells electricity or natural gas to nearly 400,000 residential and small-business customers in five states. This transaction, which was completed in January of this year, has enabled us to unlock additional value for shareholders, boosting 2001 earnings by a projected 10 cents per share.
Looking ahead, Sempra Energy Solutions will continue to pursue an ambitious agenda. Within the next three years, it aims to be one of the top energy service companies in the commercial and industrial market, reaching $2 billion in revenue. To accomplish this, it will continue to expand its sales organization and marketing efforts to grow in target industry segments.
 13.
 
We stated that net income from international operations would reach $25 million and that we would expand distribution systems located in high-growth markets.
REACHING OUT In 2000, Sempra Energy International expanded its business in regions across borders where it has traditional strengths. A focus on opportunities in the Americas — particularly Northern Mexico and the Southern Cone — has resulted in major new businesses in those areas.
Among the initiatives that have boosted earnings is the acquisition of an additional equity interest in the Camuzzi Gas companies in Argentina, as well as increased revenues from the Chilquinta Energía electric distribution utility in Chile, which Sempra Energy International jointly acquired in mid-1999 with PSEG Global.
Further, what was just a vision last year — the Bajanorte Pipeline — has received regulatory approval in Mexico to proceed and is now one of Sempra Energy International’s most important projects. When completed in November 2002, this pipeline will extend 135 miles across the northern Baja California peninsula, carrying as much as
500 million cubic feet of natural gas each day to fuel new power plants in the region — including Sempra Energy Resources’ newly announced 600MW facility in Mexicali — that will feed energy-hungry economies on both sides of the border. With Northern Mexico among the fastest growing regions in the world, we foresee significant further opportunity in this area.
In October, through its Sempra Atlantic Gas unit, Sempra Energy International broke ground on its Nova Scotia natural gas distribution system. This project will bring gas to 18 counties of the province, serving potentially 300,000 households by 2008.

 WITH VENTURES THAT PROVIDE NATURAL GAS AND ELECTRICITY SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN MEXICO, ARGENTINA, CHILE, PERU, URUGUAY AND CANADA, SEMPRA ENERGY INTERNATIONAL IS FOCUSED ON THE DEVEL- OPMENT AND OPERATION OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS IN THE AMERICAS.
Sempra Energy International
 
In 2000, Sempra Energy International earned $33 million — a near 16-fold increase over 1999 — and dramatically extended our global reach.
 
 “WE HAVE EXPANDED FROM FOUR BUSINESSES IN TWO COUNTRIES IN 1998 TO 13 PROJECTS IN SEVEN COUNTRIES IN 2000 WITH $1.2 BILLION IN ASSETS — TODAY SERVING NEARLY 2.6 MILLION CUSTOMERS.”

Given its knowledge of these contiguous geographies and cultures, Sempra Energy International chose to focus its efforts largely on the Americas, rather than in far-flung corners of the world. Indeed, its familiarity with doing business in the Americas aids in partnering with regional governments to develop successful businesses.
Moving forward in 2001, Sempra Energy International’s goals are to grow its existing businesses, capture adjacent opportunities and, where appropriate, cross-sell other energy-related and communications services from the Sempra Energy companies.
 15.

We stated that we would invest in new technologies to develop next-generation products, enhance core business operations and create incremental earnings.
CONNECTING TO SUCCESS Sempra Communications was formed in 2000 to provide information solutions through partnerships with leading technology companies. In April 2000, the group’s unique mix of energy expertise and information-technology experience led Aerie Networks to select Sempra Communications as a partner in its 12-member joint venture to build a new high-bandwidth, 20,000-mile, nationwide broadband network.
In June 2000, Sempra Communications was granted authority to provide competitive local exchange telephony services in California, allowing the company to explore a variety of new, telecommunications-based business ven- tures. In addition, over the past year, Sempra Communications contributed its expertise in support of Sempra Energy Solutions’ systems design projects for the burgeoning data-center and Web-hosting markets. These “infor- mation warehouses,” which store equipment and data for the ever-increasing Internet and e-business needs of large corporations, pose unique challenges for the safe, secure transmission of power and information.
Also in the information management arena, our Soliance joint venture is creating Web-based information technology systems for small- and mid-sized natural gas and electric utilities adapting to deregulated markets nationwide. The company offers rapid delivery, lower up-front capital costs and fixed-price, fixed-time solutions in the Application Services Provider marketplace.

 IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER SEMPRA ENERGY COMPANIES AND PARTNERS, SEMPRA COMMUNICATIONS PROVIDES INFRASTRUCTURE EXPERTISE TO BUSINESSES BUILDING THE NEXT GENERATION OF COMMUNI- CATIONS NETWORKS.
Sempra Energy Technology Ventures
 
In 2000, Sempra Communications became a partner in one of the most ambitious telecom ventures in the industry.
 
 “SUCCESSFUL PARTNERING IN NEW TECHNOLOGY VENTURES TAKES EXPERIENCE, ASSETS AND A DIS- CIPLINED APPROACH TO INVESTING — THESE ARE THE QUALITIES BY WHICH WE JUDGE OUR SUCCESS.”
— Michael W. Allman, President, Sempra Communications
Soliance secured important contracts in 2000, including agreements with City Public Service, the municipally owned gas and electric utility serving San Antonio, Texas, as well as with Sempra Atlantic Gas, Centrica, plc and Energy America. Additionally, Soliance was recognized last year for the excellence of its operations by AMR Research, a leading industry research firm.
We continue to identify more high-technology opportunities, leveraging our valuable intellectual capital and entrepreneurial drive to secure strong investments in promising early-stage businesses.

SPECIAL FOCUS:
THE ENERGY CRISIS AND OUR CALIFORNIA UTILITIES
We stated that our utilities would deliver safe, reliable service — even in what proved to be a very challenging environment.
MANAGING IN CRISIS I would like to address the key issues in this crisis, as well as the solid performance of our two utilities, Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) and San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E).
First, some history is in order. In July 1999, the California Public Utilities Commission determined SDG&E had com- pleted the recovery of its stranded costs under California’s 1996 electric restructuring law. This meant that the rate freeze was lifted for SDG&E customers in San Diego and southern Orange counties. When the wholesale price of power spiked last summer, SDG&E customers were the first in the country to feel the full brunt of the volatile wholesale electricity market.
Amidst the hardship and turmoil the energy crisis caused SDG&E’s customers, its employees never lost sight of their commitment to providing safe and reliable energy-delivery service. In a year of undeniable challenge, both SDG&E and SoCalGas met or exceeded their goals for service and reliability. I am extremely proud of these accomplishments.
In fact, 2000 was a landmark year for SoCalGas in the face of unprecedented demand and rising natural gas costs. It became the first U.S. utility to connect its 5 millionth meter, set a record for gas throughput and changed its entire operation to deliver more gas to fuel California’s power plants as they struggled to keep pace with California’s electricity needs.
At the heart of the dysfunctional electric market is an imbalance of supply and demand. In California, no major

 “WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT AT THE CORE OF OUR ENERGY PROBLEMS IS A CRITICAL SHORTAGE OF REASONABLY PRICED POWER TO MEET TODAY’S DEMANDS. ANY ‘FIX’ THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE LACK OF SUPPLY WILL FAIL.”
— Edwin A. Guiles, Group President, Regulated Business Units. Pictured with Debra L. Reed, President of SDG&E.
 new power plants have been brought online in the past decade, a period during which the state’s electric demands have grown 14.5 percent, according to the California Energy Commission. Energy demand in neighboring
states has grown even faster, resulting in those states no longer having excess power to export.
Consumers have a critical role to play as well. While supply is a problem, all of us need to conserve. Technology advances also can help curb demand — real-time electric metering would provide accurate price signals and encourage efficient energy use.
Californians must begin to see the true cost of electricity. When energy prices soared last summer, the state set a new retail rate cap for SDG&E customers at 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour. These charges that consumers see are one-third or less of the actual wholesale price SDG&E paid for the electricity. At the end of January 2001, this “undercollected” balance reached $605 million. SDG&E has a legislative guarantee that it will be able to recover its prudently incurred power costs after the rate cap ends in 2002 or 2003.
In February, a new state law was enacted giving California’s Department of Water Resources authority to buy power on behalf of SDG&E, PG&E and Southern California Edison. This change should keep SDG&E’s undercollec- tion from expanding, as long as the state continues to procure enough energy to meet SDG&E’s full power needs.
At this critical juncture, our focus should be on two questions: What will reduce demand for power? What will increase power supplies? This problem will be solved only by addressing these fundamental questions.
19.

 We stated that the year 2000 would be just the beginning.
Despite its challenges, 2000 has been a successful year on many different levels. In addition to the mile- stones already mentioned in this report, we are equally proud of the ways in which we have enriched our corporate culture.
The corporation becomes stronger by building a workforce and a network of suppliers that reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate. To that end, we were extremely pleased to have been recognized in 2000 for our successful corporate diversity programs.
In July 2000, we earned the No. 4 spot on Fortune magazine’s list of “America’s 50 Best Companies for Minorities,” marking the company’s third consecutive year among the top five of this prestigious grouping. The ranking was based on Sempra Energy’s efforts in 15 different categories, including hiring, promoting and retaining people of ethnic diversity, as well as outreach to minority suppliers and charitable contributions.
In September, we were awarded the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs’ prestigious EVE (Exemplary Voluntary Efforts) Award for the quality of our affirmative action pro- grams. This award is given to just a handful of U.S. organizations each year.
Satisfied though we may be with the year just past, there is still much work to do. As we look ahead, Sempra Energy will continue to set realistic goals — and meet them.
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank you for your continued support. Sincerely,
STEPHEN L. BAUM Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
