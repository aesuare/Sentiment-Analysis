In 2013, we took significant steps toward creating stockholder value:
• We completed the partial IPO of
our Blackhawk gift and prepaid card subsidiary in April 2013 selling 11.5 million shares at $23 per share.
• We sold our Canadian operations to Sobeys Inc. for C$5.8 billion in November 2013
• We exited the Chicago market, which generated a significant tax benefit.
2013 Stock Price Summary
In March 2014, we announced that we entered into a definitive merger agreement with AB Acquisition, a company owned by Cerberus Capital and a number of partners, which is discussed in our definitive proxy statement filed on June 19, 2014.

       Results From Continuing Operations
Based on continuing operations, which exclude results from our former Canadian division and Dominick’s in Chicago, sales increased 0.2% in 2013 to $36.1 billion. We achieved ex-fuel identical store sales growth of 1.7%, our highest in several years, and the first positive volume year since 2006. The positive sales were largely offset by lower fuel sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.6 billion.2
Our continuing operations generated $1.0 billion in cash from operating activities in 2013. We lowered debt by $1.4 billion to end the year with debt
of $4.2 billion. Our cash balance at year-end of $4.6 billion was higher versus prior years, primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of our Canadian operations. We completed $664 million in share repurchases and announced our eighth dividend increase to shareholders—to $0.20 per share
per quarter totaling $181 million paid for the year. We also invested $767 million in capital expenditures. Our PDC real estate subsidiary remained active in building, leasing and selling shopping center assets.
Sales Initiatives
We are committed to continuing to
drive sales and operating profit
dollars in our core grocery business.
To generate results, we are focused on better meeting shoppers’ diverse needs by offering a local, relevant assortment and an improved price/value proposition while providing a differentiated in-store experience. We are applying localization at the individual store level, while
also offering a stronger level of person- alization both through store clustering
and loyalty-driving initiatives such as Just for UTM and Fuel Rewards. In addition, we are focused on Center of Store remodels, which make our stores more shoppable. We are also growing sales through a new approach to shrink, putting more products on the shelves for purchase.
Center of Store Remodels
Our customers told us how much they enjoy shopping our remodeled Lifestyle stores, which focus mainly on the perimeter of our stores, but they viewed the Center of Store as undifferentiated and difficult to shop. In fact, many shoppers navigate from the perimeter of the store and only access aisles that contain products on their list. Based
on this feedback, we designed and are implementing a new Center of Store concept to better engage with our shoppers and ultimately drive sales and profits.
We organized categories into destination “zones” and strategically placed departments adjacent to each other to make shopping easier. We focused on three main areas: Meals
and Ingredients, Healthy Living and
Pet and Baby. We lowered shelves and added bright lighting and color-coded signs to improve shopability. We also improved accessibility by opening up space and adding cut-throughs that connect perimeter to Center of Store departments, and we minimized clutter, making the aisles more inviting and easier to walk through. In 2013, we remodeled 177 stores to incorporate this new design, and we expect to complete approximately 200 more in 2014.
MEETING CONSUMER NEEDS
We revamped our Eating Right line to include additional consumer needs such as gluten-free and low-calorie.
Consumer Brands
Within our private label portfolio, Health & Wellness brands continued to drive sales. O OrganicsTM ended the year with $450 million in sales and 1,150 items, and Open NatureTM, our line of food products using natural ingredients, achieved over $200 million in sales and now offers over 450 items. Innovation continued as we launched 774 new items in the year. All of our efforts led to sales of our private label brands accounting for 28.1% of our total grocery sales, a record for Safeway
and one of the highest in the industry.
Employees and Customers
Our employees and customers continue to be very involved in our corporate social responsibility activities and achievements. Their dedication and generosity to various causes continues every year. I have enjoyed meeting many employees in my visits to the stores and introducing them at our Town Hall meetings. Their stories are inspiring to us all.
In closing, I would like to thank all
of our loyal customers, hard-working employees and valued stockholders and bondholders for your support throughout the year. We made tremendous progress in 2013, and we expect to continue to improve the business in 2014.

    CENTER OF STORE
We created the Healthy Living Zone to provide a better connection between the pharmacy and the adjacent health and wellness area.
Localization / Store Clustering
Our localization strategy is predicated on determining the right merchandis- ing for each store and community. We group our stores into shopper segments (“clusters”) based on demographics and tailor the merchandising accordingly. We then personalize each store to meet the needs of the customers the store serves. We kicked off the “Premium” cluster early in 2013, thereby adding more items our customers wanted and providing “one-stop shopping” conve- nience for them. Approximately 200 stores were remerchandised in 2013, and more are planned for 2014. We
also began implementing our Hispanic clustering strategy in approximately 260 stores. Asian and other clusters are planned to be rolled out in 2014. As we are still in the early stages, we continue to learn, and we expect the concepts to evolve.
Loyalty Programs
Our customers also benefited from
our savings and loyalty programs. We completed the rollout of our fuel part- nership programs with Chevron and ExxonMobil to cover approximately 94% of our stores—offering our customers the ability to conveniently redeem Fuel Rewards. Just for U continued to gain
a loyal following resulting in nearly six million registered users at the end of the year. It is available to our shoppers in all divisions.
     SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
Our employees and customers raised or donated over $175 million in funds and products in 2013. Our employees also logged over one million volunteer hours in our communities.
           ADDRESSING CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS
In the fourth quarter, our Consumer Brands group introduced a new private label brand with Food Network chef Marcela Valladolid to better meet the needs of our Hispanic shoppers and those desiring Hispanic products.
