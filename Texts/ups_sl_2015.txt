                           Dear Fellow Shareowner,
In the 108-year history of UPS, I can’t recall a more exciting time to be in logistics. Every day, we interact with 10 million customers in more than 220 countries
and territories and serve as a preferred logistics partner with customers across all industries. The fast pace of change in the industries we serve makes logistics more important than ever.
In the retail sector, the revolution in online shopping continues to spread across borders giving rise to a new
era of global e-commerce. The unique capabilities of our global network give us more opportunities than ever to serve customers from fast-growth industries like healthcare and aerospace.
In the manufacturing sector, multinationals are alternately offshoring, re-shoring
and near-shoring their supply chains at a quickening pace, while demanding that their logistics providers stay a step ahead of these changes.
The accelerating pace of change means
that UPS must deliver more in a complex and rapidly evolving world. The companies that will prosper during transformational periods like this will be the ones that
help customers solve problems, see opportunities they don’t see, and – most important – deliver results. Scale matters
in this new era, so customers will gravitate to providers whose networks are broad and balanced. The companies that succeed will also be the ones that meet the demands of the present while preparing their customers to Navigate Tomorrow.

Our 2015 results demonstrate that UPS can thrive in this changing environment, as shown by our continued ability to meet the expectations of customers and investors alike:
• UPS delivered, on average, more than 18.3 million packages for our customers each day in 2015,
or 1.7 percent more than the year before. The e-commerce boom has come with its own set of challenges – namely, requiring us to continually optimize our network given the rise in less-dense residential deliveries and the spike in package volumes around holidays. However, the continued rollout of our proprietary ORION route-optimization software, coupled with our acquisition of Coyote Logistics and our numerous initiatives to build more density among shippers, enabled us to boost operational efficiency. In 2016, we will build on these initiatives while continuing to automate more of our hubs across the world.
• Even as we invest, we continue to generate strong results that position UPS for profitable growth. Thanks to our focus on revenue management and operational execution during the peak season, UPS ended 2015 with record fourth-quarter earnings per share and our highest operating profit ever. For the full year, adjusted diluted earnings per share* increased 14 percent, to $5.43, which was also an all-time high. In addition, we exceeded financial expectations in each quarter in 2015, demonstrating that UPS can fulfill the needs
of our customers while delivering the financial performance our investors deserve.
•
While we continue to make investments that improve the efficiency of our network, we are also improving the customer’s experience. We currently have a series of internal optimization projects underway to streamline our inside operations, control costs and improve customer service levels.
Some have predicted
that traditional delivery
services could be
vulnerable to new business models. We
believe these views understate the increasing importance of customer experience. At UPS, we’re giving consumers more flexibility than ever to receive packages when and where they choose, and to make returns easier than ever. In short, we enable shippers to provide their customers with
a stellar end-to-end experience that others can’t. We provide UPS customers with the choice, convenience and control they deserve with offerings like UPS My Choice®, which has grown to more than 22 million subscribers. In addition, we continue to expand the size of our UPS Access PointTM network, which now consists of more than 24,000 remote locations where consumers can pick up packages on their schedule.

                • Our strong operating performance enables us to earn record returns for our shareowners. Our free cash-flow† generation remained robust, at
$5.1 billion, enabling us to raise the dividend by
9 percent in 2015. This is the 46th consecutive year that we have increased or maintained our dividend annually. Our strong cash flow also allowed
UPS to fund $2.4 billion in capital expenditures and repurchase more than $2.7 billion in shares. We have returned more than $58 billion to shareowners since going public in 1999.
Operations Review
Our focus in 2015 was to continue investing
in new capacity and technology. The financial results we achieved were made possible by
these investments, by ensuring we are properly compensated for the value we provide, and by the determination and dedication of our people.
Throughout the year, all three segments made changes to pricing policies and took a disciplined approach to top-line growth. We worked closely with customers to improve profitability, while occasionally stepping away from some low-value opportunities. These pricing initiatives enabled
us to offset the strong revenue headwinds we faced from unfavorable currency conversions and lower fuel surcharge revenues. As a result, adjusted operating profits* rose 9.2 percent over 2014 on a 0.2 increase in total revenue.
We also closed on the $1.8 billion acquisition
of Coyote Logistics during the third quarter.
The Coyote acquisition represented the largest purchase in our history and established UPS as
a top-tier competitor in the asset-light truckload brokerage industry. You’ll hear more in the coming year about this company and our plans to expand this unique business model and technology within the industry and within UPS.
Global Package Operations
Daily shipping volume increased 1.7 percent, with U.S. Domestic volume growing slightly faster than International. UPS demonstrated a disciplined approach to growth in 2015, declining to renew some lower-yielding contracts while at the
same time improving operating margins. When combined with the pricing initiatives discussed earlier, these actions drove package yield higher in 2015.
Small package operations benefitted from ORION and delivered high-quality service in the most efficient manner. Technology implementations
in the package operations and the addition of
new facilities across the globe helped produce strong operating margin expansion. In total, global package adjusted operating margin* expanded by 120 basis points, to 14.3 percent in 2015.

In the U.S., our small package segment saw revenue growth of 2.5 percent over the prior year. Revenue gains were dampened by about 250 basis points,
as falling oil prices resulted in lower fuel surcharge revenue. Year-over-year revenue growth was partially driven by strong demand for UPS Deferred Air products, which rose almost 14 percent, and Next Day Air, which grew 3.3 percent. These products benefitted from the competitive dynamics of the fast-growing ecommerce marketplace. As more consumers demand faster delivery of their orders, UPS air products grew faster than ground products in 2015.
The combination of improved pricing and network efficiency resulted in adjusted operating profit* growth of 7.1 percent and adjusted operating margin* expansion of 50 basis points over 2014. Improved operating leverage was accomplished through the implementation of technology projects like ORION and more-efficient network management.

growth in many regions of the world. These macro headwinds combined with a roughly 1,000 basis- point drag from lower fuel surcharges and currency changes pushed revenue down 6.5 percent for the year. Total daily shipments increased 1.2 percent, pushed higher by Export products. Total Export shipment growth in 2015 was 3.2 percent.
Disciplined pricing initiatives and improved network management resulted in adjusted operating profit* growth of almost 15 percent. The adjusted operating margin* for International expanded by 330 basis points, to 18 percent, in part due to our ongoing hedging strategy.
As a result, the International segment recorded
its best year ever in 2015, with operating profit topping $2 billion for the first time. We are pleased by the consistent momentum we maintained all year as the segment accelerated operating profit growth in all four quarters.

rose 0.8 percent in 2015. Currency exchange rate changes and lower fuel surcharges contributed to about a 450-basis point drag on revenue growth. Initiatives to improve account profitability in Forwarding and UPS Freight resulted in lower revenues, yet higher profits. The segment also suffered from slowing in the U.S. Less-Than- Truckload, International Air Freight and Truckload Brokerage markets. These industries remain highly dependent on industrial manufacturing growth, which was muted in 2015.
While revenue growth was challenged in 2015, profitability continued to improve. In fact, adjusted operating profit* increased 8.1 percent and the operating margin* expanded 60 basis points,

                  In 2015, UPS was one of the initial 13 leading companies to take the American Business Act on Climate Pledge – committing to reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity 20 percent by 2020. UPS already has achieved more than half of its goal for its alternative fuel and advanced technology fleet to drive a billion miles by the end of 2017. This will enable us to avoid as much as 12 percent of our annual conventional ground fuel use.
During the past year, UPS was again recognized for its leadership in sustainability. For the second consecutive year, UPS scored a perfect 100 in
the CDP’s Climate Disclosure Leadership Index of S&P 500 companies. Our company also scored among the highest of those ranked for the fifth straight year for its commitment to transparency, its corporate governance regarding climate change and for how it tracks and discloses its impact on the environment.
For the third consecutive year, UPS was also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI World), and was included on the DJSI North America Index for the 11th straight year. Additionally, UPS was recognized as one of the “World’s Most Ethical Companies” by the Ethisphere Institute for the ninth successive year and chosen by CR Magazine as one of the “100 Best Corporate Citizens” for the sixth consecutive year.
On the community front, UPS is on track to achieve its pledge of completing 20 million hours of global volunteer service by the end of 2020. By the end of the decade, non-profits will receive volunteer assistance valued at more than
$460 million.
