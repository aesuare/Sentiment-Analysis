PACCAR had an excellent year in 2013, as it achieved record revenues due to good truck markets in North America and Europe. The company has earned an impressive 75 consecutive years of net income. This remarkable achievement was due to our 21,800 employees who delivered industry-leading product quality, innovation and outstanding operating efficiency. PACCAR increased its global diversification, opening a new DAF truck manufacturing facility in Ponta Grossa, Brasil, in October 2013. PACCAR’s superior financial strength enabled the company to invest $661 million of capital and research and development in 2013 to enhance its manufacturing capability, introduce a new range of vehicles and engines and strengthen its aftermarket capabilities. PACCAR delivered 137,100 trucks to its customers and sold a record $2.82 billion of aftermarket parts. PACCAR’s excellent S&P credit rating of A+ results from consistent profitability, a strong balance sheet and excellent cash flow. Looking ahead to 2014, the North American truck market is expected to improve modestly compared to 2013 due to a better economy. The European truck market could be lower due to the effect of the “pre-buy” in late 2013 stimulated by Euro 6 emissions regulations. It is anticipated that there will be continued growth in the aftermarket parts business due to improving economic conditions as well as the age of the industry truck fleet. PACCAR Financial should continue to perform well due to an improving economy.
PACCAR’s net income of $1.17 billion on revenues of $17.12 billion was the third best in company history. PACCAR declared regular dividends of $.80 per share and a special dividend of $.90 per share. Regular quarterly cash dividends have more than tripled in the last 10 years. Shareholders’ equity was a record $6.63 billion.

A LOOK AHEAD — PACCAR’s 21,800 employees enabled the company to distinguish itself as a global leader in the technology, capital goods, financial services and aftermarket parts businesses. Superior product quality, technological innovation and balanced global diversification are three key operating characteristics that define PACCAR’s business philosophy.
Current estimates for the 2014 Class 8 truck industry in the U.S. and Canada indicate that truck sales could range from 210,000-240,000 units. Sales for Class 6-7 trucks are expected to be between 60,000-70,000 units. The European 16+ tonne truck market in 2014 is estimated to be in the range of 200,000-230,000 trucks, while demand for medium trucks should range from 50,000-55,000 units.

PACCAR plans to grow its business in all markets. PACCAR is well positioned and committed to maintaining the profitable results its shareholders expect by delivering industry-leading products and services globally.
