KEEP ASKING QUESTIONS.
   What makes Allstate clearly different? Four things: a powerful competitive position; an innovative strategy; proven, principled management and outstanding execution.
In 2003, this combination produced strong results. Allstate recorded a record $32.1 billion in revenue. Net income more than doubled to $2.7 billion. Operating income was up 28 percent to $2.7 billion—another record level. Return on equity rose
to 14.2 percent and operating income return on equity* rose to 16.5 percent.
These results are built on a solid foundation. We’ve continued to expand our exclusive distribution net- work, which grew by 600 this year to 12,900 exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists. We’ve added a pipeline of thousands more independent producers. And we’ve nurtured one of the best-known brands in American business to help us form relation- ships with more than 16 million households.
Deepening and adding to those relationships is
how Allstate grows profitably for the future. We’re more
precisely matching the premiums individuals pay to the
risks they represent, and reaching out to largely over-
looked middle income Americans who want to protect what they have today and prepare for tomorrow. Allstate has the size and the precision, the tools and the tactics, to win with this strategy. And we have momentum.
Leading the effort is a talented, experienced management team that stands among the finest in the industry. And your company’s record on corporate gover- nance shows it does not trade integrity for expediency. Allstate is among America’s highly-rated companies for corporate governance. For investors, that’s a must.
Equally important, and the key to the company’s success in 2003, was out- standing execution on our “better, bigger, broader” strategy. In our Allstate Protection business, Strategic Risk Management (SRM) again gave Allstate an edge. This sophisticated pricing and underwriting process helps the company be more competitively priced in targeted customer segments. Result: we’re increasing our share of customers who are more likely to renew with Allstate and to buy additional products.
We executed on countrywide marketing and distribution programs as well as specific underwriting, regulatory and marketing efforts to improve our business opportunity in California, Texas and Florida—among our largest markets. As a result, policies in force for our Allstate brand standard auto and homeowners lines trended upward beginning in the second quarter of 2003. Moving forward, our focus will continue to be on improving customer retention in all of our business lines to aid growth.
Allstate’s claims management performance was again best-in-class in 2003. The company’s Property-Liability claims and claims expense ratio, which decreased to 70.6 percent in 2003 from 75.6 percent in 2002, marked an improvement for the second straight year.
Steps taken to strengthen Allstate agencies continued in 2003. In recent years, we transitioned from multiple agent contracts and programs to a single exclusive agency program. The move helped create a more entrepreneurial environment, as did linking agencies’ economic interest with the company’s through an increased focus on growth and profitability. At the same time, approximately 7,000 Allstate
exclusive agents and exclusive financial specialists have become licensed to sell registered financial products. In 2003, new sales of financial products by Allstate exclusive agencies* increased 14 percent to $1.8 billion.
For Allstate Financial as a whole, premiums and deposits* reached a record $13.1 billion in 2003. But it was a more difficult year from a profit perspective, and management is taking steps to achieve much better performance in 2004.
Your company’s overall performance last year was outstanding. But it was not unusual. In fact, what makes Allstate truly different is its record for long-term results. For the period beginning with our initial public offering in June of 1993 through the end of 2003, the total value of Allstate’s return to shareholders exceeded both the Standard & Poor’s Property & Casualty and the Standard & Poor’s 500 indices. To sustain momentum in 2004, your company will refine and improve SRM in its protection business. It will grow the number of exclusive agencies. It will invest in marketing and advertising. It will help agencies be more productive by introducing streamlined technology platforms and
programs to help recruit and train support staff. In claims, Allstate will improve customer satisfaction and performance through more efficient processes.
Allstate Financial will continue to simplify and standardize its product suite. Last year, for example, we launched new offerings like the multi-manager Allstate® Adviser variable annuity, while retiring more than 36 products that didn’t gain suf- ficient scale. In 2004, Allstate Financial will refocus on profitably growing its share of wallet with the top 75 banks as well as the primary base of broker-dealers and agencies that drive most of our volume. And we will manage our cost structure, delivering quality products and services to our customers with the least
possible expense.
Allstate also will continue to manage capital wisely. In early 2004, the company announced a dividend increase of 22 percent. And we announced an addition to our current share repurchase program of $1 billion, to be completed in 2005. Sound capital management has helped Allstate consistently deliver on its promis- es to customers, invest for growth and generate solid returns for investors—all at the same time. We expect more of the same in 2004 and beyond. We leave 2003 with a debt of gratitude to Michael Miles, an invaluable director for our board over the past decade who will not stand for re-election at the annual sharehold- ers’ meeting in May. Michael made many contributions during his tenure, and I thank him for his loyal service.
