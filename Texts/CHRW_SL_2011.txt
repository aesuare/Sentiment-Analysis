processes to work for our customers. Companies value our dedication and our focus on transportation and logistics details because it helps them remain competitive.
Our people have solved business problems for tens of thousands of companies over time. We have used these engagements to develop best practices that can
be customized into unique solutions for other companies—without reinventing the wheel. And we still relish the chance to dig into a problem we haven’t seen before and solve it. Our aim, as always, is to put the best of best practices to work for all of our customers.
Our scale also attracts customers. In 2011, we handled more than 10 million shipments on their behalf. As we leverage these huge volumes, our customers obtain benefits in rates and service levels that they might not see otherwise. And our scale is global, an attribute many of our smaller competitors cannot match. Combined
with scale is scalability—the ability we have to scale services up and down in synchronization with each customer’s ebbing and flowing business needs.
Finally, in a volatile world, companies appreciate the financial stability that
C.H. Robinson brings to the table. They see we are debt free, that we have capital to invest in complementary businesses where it makes sense, and that we are committed to global commerce with our network of offices and employees around the world. All of this tells customers that we are in business for the long haul.
Forward-Thinking, Forward-Moving
Our method of providing transportation and supply chain services has never been more relevant than it is today. As we add value to the businesses of our customers, contract carriers, and suppliers, we’re becoming more integrated into their supply chains. Our employees are energetically pursuing new customers and strengthening our position in markets new and old.
That brings us to an important point. Although we’re a large company compared with some of our competitors, our $10.3 billion in total revenues represents only a small fraction of the trillions spent on freight transportation and logistics worldwide. All of this makes us confident that our future looks bright indeed.
Our markets are large and fragmented, with significant room for our growth. Our execution remains unmatched. Global trends are driving increased demand for our services. Our variable cost business model has enabled us to stay very efficient internally while maintaining industry-leading profitability. Our balance sheet is debt free, and our financial strength and scale enable us to continue to invest in our people, technology, and relationships. All of this makes us very confident in our strategy and our opportunities for the future.
I hope you are pleased with your company’s performance and evolution. We’re excited about the role we can play in the new realities of global supply chains. I hope you are, too.
Thank you for your support,
John P. Wiehoff
Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
