Dear Shareholder: I am pleased to present you Exelon's 2005 Financial Information: Exelon again reported strong financial and operating results for 2005. We are now the most highly valued company in the industry. Our success is attributable to continued operating improvements and careful financial management, as well as rising energy prices. While we face challenges in both Illinois and New Jersey, they arise from our continuing effort to advance competition, and ultimately the interests of our customers and the fortunes of our shareholders. I remain confident that we will meet these challenges. The proxy statement and voting materials for the 2006 annual meeting of shareholders will be delivered to you, under separate cover, later next month. Thank you for your continued support of Exelon Corporation.

John W. Rowe Chairman, President and CEO
