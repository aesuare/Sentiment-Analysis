CHAIRMAN’S REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S REPORT
As Chairman I am pleased to provide the following report on the Company for the year ended 30 June 2015.
Capital Management
In July 2014 World Reach Limited embarked upon an extensive capital restructuring initiative. A renounceable rights offer allowed existing shareholders the right to purchase one new share per eligible share owned, at an issue price of $0.15 per share. The rights offer was partially underwritten to the value of $2,400,000. On 28 July 2014 the Group completed the rights offer with the issue of 16,000,000 new Ordinary Shares raising $2,400,000 in capital funds.
The funds raised from the rights issue were sufficient to repay all of the Group’s interest bearing debt. The debt repayments included the redemption of the remaining convertible notes not converted of $500,000, the repayment of a shareholder loan of
$300,000 and repayment of the bank term loan of $275,000. This was in addition to the early repayment of the balance of extended credit of US$600,000 provided by creditors to part fund the major development project.
By conversion of 26 notes and participation in the rights issue and subsequent underwriting, SGV1 Holdings Limited, a company Mr Carl Hung of Season Group is associated with, became the largest shareholder in the Company holding 21.41% of the Company’s shares. This was an extremely important investment from the Company’s point of view, solidifying a valuable trade relationship with Season Group.
Another Hong Kong based investment company, Ample Skill Limited, also participated in the rights issue and the underwriting and holds 19.12% of the Company. The investment by Ample Skill is an important strategic stake for the Company.
Performance
Following the successful recapitalisation of World Reach in July and August 2014, the Company has consolidated its financial position improving both the strength of its balance sheet and its profitability. Our net profit before tax for FY15 was $644,934, an increase of 46% over the prior year. The Group incurred a tax expense of $38,469 (2015: $19,824, and 2014 under-provision $18,645) in respect of the USA subsidiary which is not part of the Australian tax consolidated group and therefore unable to access accumulated Australian tax losses.
For the first time, in FY15 the Group has brought to account $1,406,402, being part of the income tax benefit derived from accumulated tax losses which have been recognised in the current year, following a conservative re-assessment of the Group’s ongoing profitability, in accordance with accounting standards and the Group’s policy. This increases the FY15 total net profit after tax to $2,012,867 and brings the net assets position of the Group at 30 June 2015 to $6,852,770.
Beam Communications Pty Ltd completed the development of a major new product in June 2014 and a significant highlight for the year to 30 June 2015, was the delivery of a significant portion of the Iridium GO! Units under the supply contract. There is still 25% of the second purchase order remaining to be delivered in the first half of FY16 with further orders anticipated.
Strategy and Outlook
FY15 performance was in line with the strategy and provides a firm basis for the expansion anticipated over the next 3-5 years.
The strategy document developed by the board and the CEO in 2013 has been comprehensively reviewed and updated to form a basis for planning the next 3 to 5 years when significant events in the satellite market are expected.
The new financial year is anticipated to provide the Company with an exciting range of opportunities. Key targets in the Company’s current strategic outlook include:
• Securing further supply contracts for the product launched in June 2014 and potential further development of the product;
• The successful design and development of the new concept satellite terminal announced on 9 April 2015, both on-time and on-budget, to ensure deliveries can commence during FY17 following final acceptance testing by the customer;
• Development of the SatPhone Shop business in Australia; and
• The development of new products to complement the existing range, either developed independently by the Group or under major contracts.
The Company is also now in a position to take advantage of any suitable emerging investment opportunities in the satellite market.
Appreciation to Staff and Board
Finally I would like to express my thanks and appreciation to the CEO, Michael Capocchi, his executive team and my fellow board members for their on-going efforts to deliver successful and innovative outcomes for our clients and to secure opportunities that drive growth and returns for our shareholders.
