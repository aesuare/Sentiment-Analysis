TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS
If there was ever a year that proved the strength of Caterpillar’s global business model, it was 2007. Over several decades, we’ve strategically built a worldwide manufacturing footprint, expanded our product offerings and increased our mix of integrated services businesses – confident that this diversity would keep us profitable during changing economic cycles. In 2007, we had an opportunity to prove it.
As predicted, our North American sales and revenues dropped significantly (down 11 percent) due to severe weakness in two key mar- kets: on-highway truck engines and U.S. residential construction. But customer demand for Caterpillar products in the rest of the world – particularly the emerging markets – was explosive. Sales and revenues were up 28 percent in Asia-Pacific, 34 percent in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and 18 percent in Latin America. Our integrated services businesses also grew 16 percent, representing 36 percent of total sales and revenues and providing earnings stability.
As a result, 2007 marks our fifth straight year of record sales and revenues, and our fourth consecutive year of record profit – and despite continued weakness in the United States in 2008, we’re predicting another record year. In turbulent times we are delivering results, and Caterpillar employees, dealers and suppliers around the world deserve a big thank you for our success.

WE BUILD WHAT THE WORLD NEEDS.
Demand for Caterpillar products is strong – and over the next several years, we’re predicting the best global growth we’ve experienced since the 1960s. Heavy infrastructure investment in the developing world, past underinvestment in the developed world and high commodity prices globally are all driving sales. With machine fleets aging and technology advancing, customers are in the market for Cat equipment, and we are ready to provide the solutions they need. Our global manufacturing footprint and supplier network enable us to compete cost effectively anywhere in the world, and our dealers’ unmatched product support helps ensure customers are pleased with the overall Caterpillar experience.
The same is true for our clean diesel and natural gas engines, generator sets and turbines used in petroleum, electric power, marine and industrial applications. In 2007, sales of these products (marketed under the Cat, FG Wilson, MaK, Perkins and Solar brands) more than offset the drop in on-highway truck engine sales. And our integrated services businesses – ranging from aftermarket support for our growing field population to established entities like Cat Financial, Cat Insurance, Cat Logistics, Cat Reman, OEM Solutions and Solar Turbine Customer Services – continue to provide solid growth and earnings stability. Our recent acquisition, Progress Rail Services, is exceeding expectations after just over a year of Caterpillar ownership. By 2010, we expect our integrated services businesses to contribute at least $20 billion of our top-line sales and revenues.
In each area of our business, we are pursuing sustainable develop- ment as a growth opportunity – seeking solutions to help our customers operate more safely, more efficiently and with minimal impact on the environment. Confident that product technology holds the key to many sustainability challenges, we continue to invest heavily in research and development – particularly in the area of engine emissions. In 2007, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the seventh straight year. (You can read more about our sustainable development goals and efforts in the accompanying 2007 Sustainability Report.)
WE BUILD fROM THE INSIDE OUT.
With strong growth and a positive outlook, we’re well on our way to meeting the 2010 profitable growth goals established in our enterprise strategy: sales and revenues of more than $50 billion and profit per share growth of 15 to 20 percent annually from our 2005 base. Perhaps more important, we’re making real progress on our people and operational performance objectives.
Caterpillar people are safer and more engaged in the business today than ever before. Since 2000, we’ve reduced lost-time injuries by 84 percent – and as a result of last year’s improvements, over 1,000 more employees went home safely to their families in 2007 than in 2006.

Employee engagement continues to rise, reaching a record 77 percent in 2007, with 22 divisions improving their scores. A strong commitment to leadership development and continual learning is key to achieving our people objectives. In 2007, Caterpillar was named one of Fortune magazine’s “Top Companies for Leaders in North America,” and Caterpillar University was again recognized by the American Society for Training and Development for programs that align learning to business strategy while driving employee development and engagement.
In terms of performance, we’ve put extra emphasis on ensuring that our product quality and delivery capability improve dramatically by 2010 to performance levels we’ve never seen before. Exploding demand, supply chain disruptions and a comprehensive product line update to meet stricter emissions standards make this a challenge. But we did see significant improvements in 2007, delivering substantial improvements in very early hour reliability, a key quality metric. I’m confident the ongoing implementation of the Caterpillar Production System and our continued focus on 6 Sigma will help us make significant improvements
in quality, availability, inventory turns and cost performance. It’s already changing the way we work together in facilities around the world and with our global dealer and supplier network.
WE BUILD BRIDGES, NOT WALLS.
Relentless execution of our strategy will help ensure Caterpillar remains well positioned to thrive in global markets. But we’re concerned about protectionist attitudes and policies that could hamper our ability to compete internationally. Caterpillar is a global company, with more than half our sales and employees outside the United States. In 2007, we exported $12.7 billion worth of product from the United States, helping provide jobs for tens of thousands of Caterpillar and supplier employees. Given that the United States represents only 5 percent of the world’s population, we expect international sales to keep growing as a percent of the total.
Therefore, much of our success depends on policies that support U.S. engagement with the rest of the world – specifically those that encourage free and open trade among nations. Unfortunately, Americans seem concerned about the country’s ability to compete globally. This apprehension is fanned by partisan politics, with too many elected offi- cials and political candidates concluding that fear and “scapegoating” will win more votes than common sense and thoughtful long-term solutions. As a result, U.S. support for free trade and open engagement with the rest of the world is eroding.

What American business needs from Washington is trade, tax and energy legislation focused on keeping our nation competitive in the world economy. Our company’s success is proof that U.S. exports, global sourcing and manufacturing, and international sales drive growth, employment and competitiveness along with high standards of living for American workers. It is crucial that the United States and its businesses remain active participants in the international economy. No company, and certainly no country, can build walls to greatness. We must build bridges, promoting ideas and values linked to market-based competition. In such an environment, I am convinced American business can succeed in the international economy. I know Team Caterpillar can.
WE BUILD TOGETHER.
In fact, for the past several years, I’ve maintained that Caterpillar is as well positioned to compete and win globally as any company in any industry. That’s a bold statement, but I believe it today as much as ever. We have a clear strategy for the future, an unmatched global footprint and a holistic business model that none in our industry and few in any industry can match.
Most of all, our successes are due not to a few people or a few projects, but to a global team that has rallied together around common goals and a shared commitment to our customers, dealers, investors and one another. What makes me most proud is Team Caterpillar’s attitude about our success. We’re not arrogant about what we’ve accomplished, but humble about what we must do better in the future. Growth and challenges alike await us in 2008 and beyond, and we are ready to make the most of our opportunities.

Chairman and CEO, Caterpillar Inc.
  ExECUTIVE OffICE
We restructured our executive leadership team in late 2007. With Group President Gerry Shaheen’s retirement (effective February 1, 2008) after 40 years of service to Caterpillar, we created an additional group president position and realigned our 31 divisions under six executive officers. This new team is a strong, glob- ally experienced group with broad industry and customer knowledge ready to take Caterpillar to 2010 and beyond.
