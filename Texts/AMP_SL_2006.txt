To our shareholders,

It's hard to believe that nearly a year and a half has passed since we rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to introduce Ameriprise Financial, Inc. as an independent public company following our spin off from American Express. We have accomplished more in that short period of time than many thought possible, and yet we're as focused as ever on realizing the great potential before us. In this, my second letter to shareholders, I would like to convey what we achieved in 2006 and how we intend to build upon the strong foundation and unique positioning we've established as Ameriprise Financial.

2006: A defining year
I am extremely proud of all that we accomplished in a transformational first full year as an independent public company. We established the Ameriprise FinancialSM brand; energized our advisor force; grew assets; invested in our product suite; strengthened our technology, compliance and corporate functions; and continued to successfully execute a complex separation from American Express.

Ameriprise Financial, Inc. 2006 Annual Report

Total brand awareness grew from essentially zero in late 2005 to 50 percent at year-end 2006, a remarkable testament that our advertising campaign, marketing initiatives and client experience are resonating with consumers.

Against a backdrop of these necessary and significant investments, we grew adjusted revenues 11 percent, to $8.1 billion.* We increased adjusted earnings 25 percent, to $866 million. And we finished the year with adjusted return on equity at 11.8 percent, up from 10.2 percent in 2005. Our stock price reflected our strong results, ending the year with a total return of 34.3 percent and outpacing the S&P 500 total return of 15.8 percent. Our business and financial results have put to rest many of the questions we faced when we first entered the public market. Our independence created an incredible opportunity for our company to embrace our new and increasingly powerful brand -- one that speaks directly to mass affluent and affluent consumers and highlights our unique approach to financial planning. Total brand awareness grew from essentially zero in late 2005 to 50 percent at year-end 2006, a remarkable testament that our advertising campaign, marketing initiatives and client experience are resonating with consumers. The first of 78 million baby boomers turned 60 in 2006, initiating an unprecedented move to retirement that will continue for the next two decades. They (I should say, we) can expect to live longer than any generation before us. We believe our strategy and strong platform position us well to capitalize on this opportunity.

In 2006, we grew our mass affluent and affluent client base 10 percent. Our clients' personal relationships with their advisors are the cornerstone of our business, and our advisor force, the third largest retail sales force among Securities Industry Association member firms, is remarkably energized by our independence. By serving more mass affluent clients and developing deeper relationships with them, our advisors generated an 18 percent increase in gross dealer concession, a measure of advisor productivity. The bedrock of our client-advisor relationship is our commitment to providing comprehensive financial planning. We are a leader in planning, and we intend to grow this position by investing significant resources in new products and tools that will enable advisors to offer planning to new clients more easily while serving existing clients more fully. One of these tools is our Dream Book SM guide, which helps people identify their dreams and is the first step in our unique and collaborative Dream > Plan > Track > SM client experience -- our approach to financial planning. We help clients realize their dreams by providing an extensive product and service platform. Advisors start with each client's unique situation and, through the development of a financial plan, offer solutions -- both from Ameriprise Financial and other companies -- that address cash management, savings, investing, income generation, protection and trust needs. Investing in new products is a critical element of our strategy to grow client assets. In 2006, we launched more than 40 asset management, insurance, annuity and banking products. We also established Ameriprise Bank, FSB to better serve clients' cash management, borrowing and personal trust needs. Our client-centered approach contributes to our ability to grow assets. With some help from strong equity markets, we ended the year with $466 billion in owned, managed and administered assets and $174 billion in life insurance in-force, both up 9 percent. This growth also reflected the impact of clients increasingly choosing fee-based relationships, as evidenced by strong inflows in investment advisory programs and variable annuities.

At RiverSource Investments, our U.S. asset management subsidiary, we are generating strong investment performance. We ranked number three of 67 mutual fund families for one-year performance in the 2006 Lipper/Barron's Fund Families Survey and further improved three-year and longer-term track records.* Internationally, Threadneedle Investments, our U.K.-based asset manager with $136 billion in assets under management, strengthened longer-term track records and continued to improve its profitability and build its retail, institutional, hedge fund and real estate businesses. RiverSource Annuities and RiverSource Insurance also performed well in 2006. We generated a 46 percent increase in variable annuity sales, increased our market share in universal life and variable universal life insurance, and retained our top ranking in variable universal life insurance. In addition, Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance premiums increased 9 percent. Our diversified business model is serving our clients and shareholders well. Our overall financial position is strong, and we are generating excess capital. In 2006, we returned more than $578 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends, and we plan to generate and redeploy excess capital moving forward.

Our future
It's an exciting time for Ameriprise Financial. The market opportunity is exceptional. Our business model is extremely well-positioned to meet the financial needs of the mass affluent and affluent. I am confident we can achieve our objectives by continuing to build our organization around our values and executing our strategy. We're investing substantial resources to reach more of our target clients and serve more of them in ongoing financial planning relationships. We're enhancing advisor support with improved tools and capabilities and strong-performing and innovative products. At the same time, we are expanding our product distribution to capture more retail and institutional assets

Meanwhile, we remain on track to complete the remainder of our separation from American Express by September of this year. From our people to our market opportunities, from our product mix to our capital position, our strengths are many. I feel very good about our ability to execute our strategy and to claim our place among the nation's leading financial services companies.
