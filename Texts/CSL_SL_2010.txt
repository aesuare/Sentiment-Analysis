 To Our Shareholders
 David A. Roberts
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Carlisle is a much stronger company coming out of 2010. Despite a tough economic climate during the year, we grew 12%, 9% organically. Our 2010 sales were $2,528 million as compared to $2,258 million in 2009. Earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) of $196 million in 2010 would have been 6% higher than EBIT in 2009 when excluding a $27 million gain related to a fire insurance settlement from 2009. The primary reason we were not able to realize more leverage on the sales growth was due to escalating raw material costs. Nearly every commodity we buy began increasing in cost in the first quarter and continued upward throughout the year. All of our businesses were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs.
Our balance sheet remains strong and conservative. With a debt-to-capital ratio of 26% and $459 million available in borrowings from our revolving credit facility at year-end, we remain well positioned to focus on growth through new product development and the pursuit of strategic acquisitions. And again in 2010, we were able to reward our shareholders with a dividend increase, our 34th consecutive year.
In 2008, we announced our long-term strategy that focused on revenue growth, margin growth, business globalization and working capital management. We have made enormous strides since 2008 to restructure our manufacturing footprint, sell non-core businesses and acquire businesses that possess a higher profit margin profile and significantly higher market growth rates. We made progress toward achieving our strategic goals in our five key areas:
$5 billion in sales
30% global sales
15% operating margins
15% working capital as a percent of sales 15% return on invested capital
Sales: Throughout 2010, our engineering organizations were focused on developing new products for their respective markets. Carlisle Construction Materials grew the Carlisle Energy Services (CES) business. Focused on capitalizing on the nation’s growing interest in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology as a renewable energy source, CES has become an industry leader able to design a variety of leading edge technologies. Combined with Carlisle SynTec’s roofing experts, they are able to design and engineer some of the most innovative roofing systems available today. Carlisle Transportation Products developed major new products including alloy wheels for the trailer market, a wide range of solid and pneumatic forklift tires for the Asia Pacific market, and high performance synchronous transmission power belts that deliver approximately four

                     times the life of competitive belts. Carlisle Brake & Friction launched new braking products for the US military’s Stryker armored fighting vehicles. Carlisle Interconnect Technologies successfully renewed a number of supply agreements with major customers, including Boeing, as a result of its product innovation and superb customer service. Carlisle FoodService developed more than 1,000 new products during 2010, many of them derived from organic and sustainable resources, making these products completely compostable. Green foodservice applications are driving the direction of our customers and our FoodService business is meeting their needs through product innovation.
Global Sales: Consistent with our long-term strategy, Carlisle’s international sales grew by 28% over the prior year and now comprise 14.5% of our total sales, bringing us closer to our goal of 30% of revenue generated from outside the US. We currently manufacture and distribute from facilities worldwide including operations in China, Europe, Mexico, Canada and Japan.

 Operating Margins: 2010 saw the continued implementation of the Carlisle Operating System (COS), our continuous improvement process based on lean principles, which has become part of the Carlisle culture. After realizing more than $20 million in cost savings in 2009, we generated $25 million additional savings in 2010. Since COS began in 2008, we have obtained a 25% improvement in manufacturing productivity, while reducing manufacturing and warehouse space 2.6 million square feet. During the year we launched a quarterly COS Recognition Program to acknowledge and reward employees for outstanding contributions and results in implementing COS in their operations. You will see our “COS Teams of the Year” on page 20 and read about their significant contributions to profitability.
Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (CIT) significantly leveraged their double-digit sales growth and made improvements to their acquired businesses. In the last three years, including the impact of acquisitions, CIT’s sales have more than doubled while their operating income nearly doubled; that during one of the most difficult economic periods in recent memory. CIT very successfully completed the integration of two strategic acquisitions during the year, Jerrik, which is on track to be one of CIT’s best EBIT margin operations, and ECS, which is moving towards a double digit EBIT margin. CIT is poised to expand with larger acquisitions that will see them become a global industry leader in high performance interconnect products.
Carlisle Brake & Friction completed the integration of Japan Power Brake during the year. This acquisition expands our global footprint along with improving our margin profile.
We closed Carlisle Interconnect Technology’s Vancouver, Washington, facility and Carlisle Brake & Friction’s Logansport, Indiana, operation, without disrupting our customers’ businesses.
We substantially completed the consolidation of our Heflin, Alabama, and Carlisle, Pennsylvania, facilities into our new factory in Jackson, Tennessee. We also finished the consolidation of our Buji, China, tire factory into our Meizhou, China, facility during the year. These consolidations will provide more efficient operations and a foundation for margin growth in 2011 and beyond.
These were the final steps in rationalizing our manufacturing and distribution footprint. We achieved over $7 million in company-wide savings from our consolidation efforts in 2010, and expect an additional $14 million in 2011.
We also completed the restructuring efforts that we undertook in 2008 to focus on our larger businesses and to divest our smaller, non-core operations. In the first quarter of 2010, we sold Johnson Truck Bodies, the refrigerated truck bodies business, and in the fourth quarter we sold Trail King Industries, the specialty trailer business. Also in the fourth quarter of 2010, we bought Hawk Corporation, a leading worldwide supplier
of friction products for brakes, clutches and transmissions. Hawk was a strategic add-on acquisition that complements Carlisle Brake & Friction. The addition of Hawk to the Carlisle family provides us with the opportunity to expand our product offering, enlarge our global footprint, and further strengthen our position as a leading global supplier of high performance braking solutions. Hawk represents the type of acquisition growth we are focused on, a company with a global footprint that designs and manufactures highly engi- neered, higher margin products.
Working Capital & Return on Invested Capital: The timing of order customization and seasonality demands have a negative impact on inventory turns. During 2010, we developed systems and procedures company-wide to improve our demand forecasting capabilities. We also identified and implemented processes and procedures that are leading to a reduction in the time it takes to receive payment from our customers.

 Additionally, we developed best payment practices across the corporation and achieved a 17% improvement in payment terms with our vendors. All of these ongoing efforts will continue to improve our working capital and return on invested capital metrics.
With the acquisition of Hawk, we realigned our business into segments that we consider core: Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM)—our commercial roofing business
Carlisle Transportation Products (CTP)—our tire and wheel, and power transmission belt product business
Carlisle Brake & Friction (CBF)—our off highway brake and friction business which includes our brake and friction business plus the business we acquired when we bought Hawk
Carlisle Interconnect Technologies (CIT)—our designer and manufacturer of high performance wire and cable, fiber optic cable and RF/microwave connectors business
Carlisle FoodService Products (CFS)—our foodservice product solutions business
We continued to focus on our people in 2010, with the ongoing development of the Annual Organization Review which identifies high potential employees and ensures they have the training, tools and opportunities
to be successful in Carlisle’s culture. New in 2010, was the design and implementation of the Carlisle Leadership Program in partnership with Indiana University’s Kelley Business School. Thirty high potential employees from our businesses across the globe were selected to participate in business projects aligned with Carlisle’s long-term strategic goals. Also designed and launched during the year was the Carlisle Management Rotational Program which recruits recent MBA graduates for leadership assignments at Carlisle and then develops these employees for future leadership roles. The program is designed to provide an accelerated path to leadership and responsibility. The 15-month program exposes participants to all of our businesses as they rotate through a variety of assignments under the direction and mentoring of Carlisle’s senior management team.
In 2009 and 2010, we proved we could be successful in the toughest of economic climates. One of the best examples of that is how our Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM) team produced more profit in 2010 than 2009, while overcoming $39 million in price and incentive degradation, and an additional $25 million in net raw material cost increases. The plants kept expenses down, drove improvements throughout their operations and employed COS strategies to make the most of a difficult economic environment. With the market for newly constructed commercial roofs down 10% in 2010, following an unprecedented decline of 30% in 2009, the CCM team focused on the reroofing market, which resulted in this market comprising 75% of their business by year-end. This is clearly what happens when a team is focused on creating opportunities. Carlisle businesses continue to creatively seek ways to be more protective of our environment. CCM has established a significant competitive advantage in growing market share in energy-efficient roofing systems
“We will face the year ahead with the same resolve that drove strong results for us this past year. We will continue to seek every opportunity to build a stronger Carlisle.”

with their offerings ranging from garden roofs that cool rooftops and help in storm water management to skylights that harness natural sunlight. Carlisle FoodService’s Green Initiative ensures that they design products to reduce energy consumption, conserve water and use recycled materials whenever possible. In addition, every major facility underwent an energy Kaizen to eliminate wasted energy. These were highly effective business process improvements resulting in energy usage savings in every facility.
2010 was a year of challenge, no doubt, but we survived, and in some areas thrived despite economic and industry downturns. We start 2011 a stronger, leaner and more focused company. We will continue to drive cost efficiencies through the implementation of COS, which is ingrained in our operating philosophy. We will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions in our Interconnect Technologies and Braking businesses that add engineered products that are sold globally. We will continue to develop new, innovative products, and stay connected to our customers providing them with solutions to their business problems. Highly qualified and motivated people will continue to be critical to our future success and we will continue to invest in our people, equipping them with the tools they need to be successful. We learned a lot about ourselves the past two years, as one often does in challenging times. We discovered we are flexible, adaptable and innovative and learned how focusing our businesses on opportunities can add value to our company.
We begin a new year with a significantly smaller manufacturing footprint and cost structure. We will face the year ahead with the same resolve that drove strong results for us this past year. We will continue to seek every opportunity to build a stronger Carlisle.
