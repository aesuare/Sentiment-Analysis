The company cautions that its current expectations for future earnings, future charge-off rates and other future performance measures are forward looking statements and actual results could differ materially from current expectations due to a number of factors, including: competition in the credit card industry; the actual account and balance growth achieved by the company; the company’s ability to access the capital markets at attractive rates and terms to fund its operations and future growth; changes in regulation; and general economic conditions affecting consumer income and spending domestically and internationally, which may affect consumer bankruptcies, defaults and charge-offs. A discussion of these and other factors can be found in Capital One’s annual and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, Capital One’s report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2002.

  Capital One’s credit card business is one of the largest, most profitable consumer-finance franchises in the world.
We built our franchise with innovative products that offer consumers more for their money. Capital One® made its mark years ago by pioneering balance transfer offers for credit card customers. Today our MilesOne® frequent flyer card is a terrific deal. It’s redeemable on any airline. There are no blackout dates. The annual fee is small, and it comes with a low fixed interest rate.
We’re growing a sizable superprime business through several products, including the “No-Hassle”SM Platinum card, which offers a low fixed rate on both cash advances and purchases plus a level of convenience and service that make Capital One the hassle-free provider of choice.
With our proprietary information-based strategy and award-winning capabilities in marketing and information technology, Capital One continually finds profitable new market niches and creates products to serve them. Our lifestyle cards are successfully targeting hundreds of microsegments, from nurses and birdwatchers to newlyweds and new parents. We’re also building relationships with small-business owners with products that increase the flexibility and convenience of their borrowing.
Capital One’s innovations have revolutionized the credit card industry. We’ve lowered consumer borrowing costs, expanded access to credit and made it possible to customize the product to the borrower. By giving consumers a great deal and aligning each credit line and interest rate with the individual’s risk profile, we’re successfully meeting the needs of a diverse range of borrowers and winning their loyalty. We’re also generating profitable growth for Capital One.
The U.S. credit card business, which was large and growing when Capital One went public in 1994, is now twice that size and still growing. The convenience of the credit card has made it the payment method of choice for millions of consumers around the world, and we believe Capital One is well positioned to continue gaining market share by offering cardholders more for their money and creating profitable products that meet diverse needs.

Our turnkey approach to auto lending is ... well ... turning a lot of keys.
Capital One® is successfully putting its credit card expertise to work in the broader consumer lending market, where we see big opportunities for profitable long-term growth.
Auto finance, with more than $1 trillion in loans outstanding, is nearly twice the size of the credit card market. After two acquisitions and four years of making auto loans, Capital One has a $7 billion portfolio with steadily improving profitability. Our skill in analyzing credit risk and pricing each loan accordingly creates a win-win situation for us and our customers: we minimize lending risk, they get the best deal. As we’ve built scale, we’ve dramatically cut operating costs, from nearly 10% of loans outstanding in 1999 to 3.57% in 2002.
Our superprime auto finance business continues to grow rapidly despite the auto industry’s offers of low- or no-interest financing. Many consumers who do the math realize that they’ll come out ahead by combining a car manufacturer’s offer of a cash rebate with financing from Capital One Auto Finance. The largest Internet originator of auto loans, Capital One Auto Finance gives superprime borrowers no-hassle service and convenient access to financing, features that are generating exceptionally high levels of customer satisfaction.
In the $175 billion installment lending business, we market personal loans to superprime borrowers, high-income people with long and stellar credit histories. The low risk allows us to offer the loans at an exceptionally low fixed rate—7.9% in many cases, which is five percentage points below the industry average. Installment lending has added $4 billion in blue-chip assets to Capital One’s managed loans.
In 2002, we entered the small-business lending sector. With a Capital One business credit card, a small entrepreneur has hassle-free access to loans for operating capital—a big help in smoothing out cash flow and meeting extraordinary expenses. Our small-business lending is growing rapidly and yielding above-average returns.
The auto finance, installment and small-business lending markets are highly fragmented, presenting opportunities for significant gains in market share. We believe our information-based strategy will allow us to transform these businesses through direct marketing, innovative products and customization. The payoffs: better deals and less hassle for borrowers and new sources of profitable growth for Capital One.

brand awareness

We continue to ask
“What’s in your wallet?” And the answer keeps getting better.
Capital One is now in a league with the best-known brands in financial services.
We’ve always offered the most innovative products, the best prices and hassle-free service, but Capital One wasn’t a household name until we started marketing our brand with the same energy we put into marketing credit cards and loans. Now 96% of Americans know who we are.
In 2002 we reached 95% of American households an average of 70 times with our award-winning “What’s in your wallet?”SM ads, which air during top-rated TV series and high-profile events, including college football games. We also became the sole title sponsor of the former Capital One Florida Citrus Bowl, which is now the Capital One Bowl.SM
We have positioned Capital One as a maverick brand for smart consumers looking for great value, a strategy that supports our growth and gives the brand a cachet with consumers in all credit and income brackets.
There’s more than advertising behind the success of Capital One’s brand building. Consumers trust the brand because they know it’s backed by first-rate products and performance. We promise great prices and great service, and we deliver. Our “No-Hassle”SM credit cards and loans are truly hassle-free. We see every interaction with consumers as an opportunity to build the brand, and through millions of encounters each day, we continue to show that Capital One is a company that really does put customers first.
A powerful brand is a powerful competitive advantage. It differentiates Capital One from hundreds of look-alike MasterCard and Visa issuers. It wins customers and keeps them. It’s a great asset as we continue our diversification beyond credit cards. It helps us form mutually profitable alliances with leading companies in other industries. And it draws top-flight talent to Capital One.

in international loans

Our international menu grew to $5.4 billion in 2002.
By exporting our know-how in consumer credit, we're capitalizing on a tremendous long-term opportunity. Our challenge is to learn what consumers around the world want in their wallets and create products that meet their needs, country by country.
Outside the United States, Capital One® now has businesses in the U.K., Canada, South Africa and France. At year-end, international balances represented 9% of our loan portfolio.
After six years in the U.K., we’re one of the largest card issuers and one of the top two in terms of account growth, making steady gains in market share. Charge-offs are low, and U.K. customers have been highly responsive to our cross-selling efforts. Our “What’s in your wallet?”SM ad campaign, launched in the U.K. during 2002, is beginning to connect with consumers.
The Canadian credit card market is small, but our business in Canada is profitable and growing. Charge-offs are low and interest rates in the Canadian market are relatively high—attractive fundamentals in our business.
We’re in the early stages of establishing Capital One in France and South Africa, and we continue to explore other markets. Many of the world’s economies are growing fast, and the consumer credit markets of Europe and Asia currently yield greater returns than the U.S. market.
While a strong international franchise can’t be built in a day, our experience shows that the great flexibility of Capital One’s information-based strategy will help us to develop profitable financial services products for a diverse range of markets around the world. Cultures vary, but the growing need for accessible, affordable credit is a global phenomenon.

We were well-prepared
for the economic downturn in 2002.
In fact, we have been since 1994.
Capital One® is built for change—wired to innovate at high speed and turn on a dime to pursue new opportunities and adapt to changing market conditions.
Capital One is also built to last. We know we can’t predict the future, but we believe we can be ready for whatever it brings. Recessions are inevitable, and interest rates are unpredictable, so we always factor recessions into our plans and hedge our interest rate risk. Because ups and downs in the capital markets are also inevitable, we have well-diversified sources of funding, including a large and growing pool of consumer deposits. And to be ready for the unexpected, we keep the Company in peak financial condition. Underwriting standards are rigorous. Credit lines are low. Accounts are closely managed. Conservatism is the hallmark of our accounting practices, and our capital now stands at an all-time high—7.9% of managed assets.
While our core business, marketing credit cards to U.S. consumers, is strong and growing, we are steadily and successfully diversifying beyond it, broadening our customer base by creating profitable new products and entering new geographies. More than 27% of our current loan portfolio was generated in markets we did not serve six years ago, and we expect the proportion to rise as we continue to diversify.
Although 2002 presented big challenges, Capital One turned in another record year. Because of its strategic focus on creating long-term value, we believe the Company has an exceptional capacity to weather the unexpected.
All the pieces are in place for continued success. Our associates are world-class. We have a powerful brand. Our highly flexible information-based strategy allows for steady diversification and rapid innovation in our existing businesses. We’re succeeding in other geographies, in auto finance and in several lending sectors new to us. All of these sectors are growing, and many are larger by far than the credit card market. We have as much confidence as ever in Capital One’s prospects, short term and long.

We love to shower
our associates with accolades.
But others keep beating us to it.
Capital One® is a great place to work.
In 2002 we again made the FORTUNE® Most Admired Companies list and the Forbes® Platinum 400, the magazine’s list of the best big companies in America, and Computerworld® and The Sunday Times® of London continue to include us on their “best places to work” lists, and in 2002 the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers,® The Black CollegianTM magazine and MBA MinoritySM magazine cited Capital One as a top employer. We’re committed to hiring talented people of all backgrounds. Diversity strengthens our competitiveness and enriches us as an employer.
The Company’s commitment to the professional development of all associates has won us top honors from Training® magazine. Our compensation and promotion philosophy is simplicity itself: great performance, great rewards.
Now a brand leader in financial services, Capital One is also a recognized leader in community service. We focus on youth at risk, education, community development and health. In 2002 more than 60% of our associates volunteered their time and talents to nonprofit organizations, collectively contributing more than 54,000 hours, 80 tons of food and 3,600 holiday gifts to children in need. Since 1996, Capital One associates have built 27 houses with Habitat for Humanity.® We also volunteer managerial expertise and technical assistance to help nonprofits make the most of their resources.
Supported by Capital One, 199 Kids’ Café® after-school centers in seven cities provide hot meals and homework assistance to 12,000 children a day. The Company also makes significant financial contributions to programs providing affordable housing, job training and health care.
A career at Capital One is an ever-expanding opportunity to work with people who thrive on trying the untried, people who want to realize their full potential—and Capital One’s.
