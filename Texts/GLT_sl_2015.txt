                                        DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
As Glatfelter entered 2015, we knew that success in a volatile world economy would demand adaptation and focused execution. As the year unfolded, we encountered significant macro-level headwinds that made it difficult
to meet our own and investors’ expectations. A weaker euro, lower product pricing, the ongoing decline of
the uncoated free sheet market, and geopolitical and economic issues in Russia/Ukraine combined to restrain our performance.
In response, Glatfelter PEOPLE remained true to our strategy of driving growth in our global, fiber-based engineered materials businesses. We pursued operational excellence and continuous improvement practices to reduce costs, improve safety, and better serve customer needs. A set of aggressive actions was initiated that helped mitigate the effects of our macro-level challenges.
• $31 million of total cost reductions were achieved, including a 3.1% workforce reduction, exceeding our target range.
• Volumes grew in core segments such as tea, single-serve coffee, technical specialties, and wipes.
• Feminine hygiene shipments increased in the second half of the year.
• Specialty Papers outperformed the uncoated free sheet market for the 11th consecutive year.
In addition, Glatfelter PEOPLE achieved another companywide safety record. We are now approaching industry top-quartile performance and have the opportunity to become a safety leader.
During the year, our balance sheet strengthened
as we carefully managed working capital and capital spending. Higher cash flow supported investments in compliance-related environmental projects, process improvement, and growth initiatives. Net debt was reduced by $46 million, and our dividend was increased for the third year in a row.
But our many accomplishments were unable
to offset the full impact of the macro-level headwinds. Adjusted annual earnings in 2015 were down 14% from the previous year, which impacted our share price performance.
