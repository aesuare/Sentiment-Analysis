   I LOOK AHEAD WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE TO A FUTURE FULL OF POTENTIAL FOR DANAHER.
LARRY CULP
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER
My appointment to CEO is both a thrill and an honor. I am grateful to George Sherman for his counsel and mentoring through the years. I am also thankful to the Board for their sup- port. Additionally, I want to recognize my Danaher colleagues and associates who have influenced my thinking, developed my skills and contributed to our collective success.
I look ahead with great confidence to a future full of potential for Danaher. Led by Pat, Steve and Phil in our Office of the Chief Executive, we have a talented and motivated team of people throughout Danaher. The power of the Danaher Business System (DBS) and the quality of our portfolio of companies create an exceptional foundation for future growth and continued superior financial performance.
Those expecting radical changes under my leadership will be disappointed. I have been clear with every- one who asks; there will be no change in our values or in our level of expectation. But certain changes are inevitable for an organization built on kaizen, or continuous improvement.
We will continue to evolve our business model. Simply stated, our model assumes exceptional people con- ceive superior business plans and make them a reality through the passionate use of DBS, thus yielding superior financial performance. Those results serve as a magnet for more outstanding people and the cycle starts over again, albeit with more momentum and strength.
Additionally, we will nurture the opportunities created by the advance of technology, particularly the Internet, and the globalization of many of our served and as-yet-unserved markets to create a truly unique and successful enterprise for years to come.
