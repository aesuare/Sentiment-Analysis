dear shareholders,
I'm pleased to report that CF Industries earned $366 million, or $7.42 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.6 billion in 2009. We shipped more than 8 million tons of fertilizer to customers in the United States, Canada and 20 other countries while successfully navigating through turbulent market conditions. After a record 2008, our operating earnings in 2009 were the second best in our history, and our net earnings nearly matched our second-best year ever, 2007, when industry conditions were stronger. The year 2009 will probably be remembered most for the long and winding course of our efforts to achieve a business combination with Terra Industries. Although we didn't reach a conclusion in 2009, we're pleased to announce that on March 12, 2010 we signed a merger agreement with Terra that will redefine the future of CF Industries. When the merger is completed, the combined company will be a global leader in nitrogen and phosphate manufacturing. The integration of the two companies will enable us to build on Terra's strengths that motivated us to pursue the combination and on our own strengths, which were very evident in our performance during 2009. A year of transition for fertilizer markets Fertilizer producers, distributors and retailers entered 2009 with burgeoning inventories following the unprecedented rise and precipitous fall of commodity prices in 2008. Nitrogen and phosphate prices continued to slide dramatically early in 2009, prompting painful inventory writedowns for

many market participants. These writedowns left marks that are still visible, as evidenced by a noticeable reluctance on the part of many customers to take inventory positions. But in this challenging environment in early 2009, we delivered strong profitability on an absolute basis and compared to expectations, in part because of our industry-leading Forward Pricing Program. What the industry really needed under these conditions was good weather and a healthy spring fertilizer application season. Unfortunately, the spring weather in North America didn't cooperate, and producers and distributors entered the summer with excess inventories. This led to reduced manufacturing rates for some of our products. We hoped for good weather in the fall, but again we were disappointed. We and others continued to carry above-normal inventories of ammonia, though inventories for other products declined in the second half due to robust international demand. Conditions overseas improved faster than those in North America, as the industry's most profound underlying trend -- increasing demand for food, including the migration to higher protein diets in developing countries -- continued. Fertilizer demand overseas was stronger than domestic demand for most of the second half of 2009, which was reflected in higher prices and increased buying activity. Record export volume Despite continued weak demand in North America, CF Industries performed well through this period. We found attractive opportunities to export record volumes of diammonium phosphate (DAP) and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) to a record number of international markets.

Even our nitrogen business, which had a difficult time competing with import competition just four years ago, became an exporter, shipping meaningful quantities of urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and granular urea to markets in Europe and South America. The exceptional logistical flexibility of our Donaldsonville, Louisiana complex was a great asset under these conditions, as it has been so frequently in the past. This strong export volume allowed us to control our inventories of DAP, MAP, UAN and urea effectively during the period in which the domestic market was sluggish. At the same time, a similar effect was at work downstream for wholesalers and distributors. The relatively low domestic prices for urea and UAN limited imports to abnormally low levels in the second half of 2009, leaving the channel lightly stocked as year-end approached. Starting in November, fertilizer purchasers became increasingly aware of these low domestic inventory levels. As demand rose, prices necessarily followed suit in order to attract imports of nitrogen products necessary to supply spring needs fully and to compete with overseas buyers for domestically produced phosphate. Buyers were prompted to consider their needs against the risks of being short of product in a rising price environment. Our results were good under these conditions as well, owing to our disciplined approach to forward sales while the domestic markets were in the doldrums. We resisted the temptation to chase forward business at unattractive margins. We maintained exposure to market prices for both our products and our inputs because we believed that domestic

This paid off in the second half of 2009, and is still paying off as we start 2010 with product available to sell into what has been a rising market. Our consistent, measured approach helped us to perform well through the various phases of transition that the industry and the company experienced in 2009. The same approach will help us perform well as we confront business challenges in the future. We have organized this year's annual report around four phases of management that demonstrate the thoughtful approach our team takes to creating value: cultivating new opportunities, investing in those that are most promising, executing our plans effectively and delivering results. Business combination with Terra After fourteen months of cultivation, our acquisition of Terra Industries, which is our most important initiative for growth and value creation, is approaching the investment stage. Advancing our proposal to combine with Terra over such a long period raised our profile in the industry and in the financial markets. We are now poised to invest in the combination we have cultivated over this period. We are very enthusiastic about the shared future that will be launched by the closing of our transaction with Terra. And we know that we must integrate our operations swiftly and effectively in order to establish the large, solid platform from which we will launch future growth initiatives.

Cultivating other opportunities Another fertile area for future growth has been Peru, where we are pursuing a major green field project to produce ammonia and urea for sale primarily in South and Central America. We made a great deal of progress in 2009, including signing the gas supply agreement and completing the FrontEnd Engineering and Design (FEED) study. The FEED study resulted in a cost estimate that was higher than expected. We have chosen to continue to search for ways to lower the investment and reduce the operating costs of the proposed facility. A lot of work is still in front of us before we will be able to reach an investment decision. Investing in our business Taking that same approach in past years generated the investments that are producing results for us now. In 2007, we acquired 50 percent of KEYTRADE AG, a trading company that sells fertilizer in 60 countries. The Keytrade relationship has expanded our access to international markets, which was a key enabler for our record export volume in 2009. We exported more than 1.3 million tons of DAP, MAP, UAN and urea to customers on five continents in 2009, compared to 500,000 tons in 2008. Recent capital investments also have expanded our capabilities. We have focused these investments on increasing efficiency, resulting in more capacity and reduced costs at our production facilities. In 2009, we invested $236 million in capital expenditures, an increase of $94 million from the 2008 level, to convert some of our strong cash flow to even stronger productive assets in North America.

Executing our plans But even with great plants and business relationships, our CF Industries team must execute our business plan every day, making adjustments as needed along the way. We did that successfully in 2009, and it shows in our results. Our management team does not achieve these results alone. Our directors bring outstanding experience and insight to guide the management of this company. I thank them for their focus and support in 2009. Delivering value An investment in shares of CF Industries returned over 85 percent in 2009, a return we're proud and pleased to participate in as your fellow shareholders. Over the coming years, the value we provide to shareholders will reflect our success in integrating CF Industries and Terra Industries in a way that serves the needs of customers and achieves the significant synergies that we believe are available in the combination. As we do that, we are confident in our ability to add value for stockholders, and we believe that the market will recognize the strength of our leadership position. Looking forward to spring In early 2010, agriculture and fertilizer markets are very favorable. Corn futures prices are in the sweet spot for corn planting. We believe a large nutrient draw in 2009, followed by under-application of nitrogen in the fall, sets the stage for strong fertilizer application rates in 2010. At the same time, domestic fertilizer inventories are low across the supply chain, and international markets are also tight. Assuming the weather cooperates, we expect strong demand in the spring of 2010 to be accompanied by attractive prices and margins.

We believe CF Industries is well positioned as we enter 2010. Our inventory positions are appropriate, natural gas costs are favorable, and our operations have good momentum. We have a great team, and we're looking forward to the great things we can accomplish together as we build a shared identity and future with our colleagues at Terra.

Sincerely,

Stephen R. Wilson Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer April 1, 2010
