LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES
 It is a tremendous privilege and honor to have the opportunity to write this, my first letter to shareholders as Chief Executive Officer of Foot Locker, Inc. I am both humbled and proud to have been selected as the leader of the high-performing team we have at Foot Locker. That the team is strong, there can be no doubt: 2014 was the fourth consecutive year that the Company's sales and profit results represented the highest levels ever achieved in our history as an athletic footwear and apparel business. We have continued to build on our strengths, seize opportunities to set records in our financial and operational performance, and identify exciting initiatives to grow the business in the future. In the remainder of this letter and the pages that follow, I will share both the details of our 2014 performance and the Company's strategic priorities for the next several years.  Before I do that, however, I must acknowledge the exceptional contributions of Ken Hicks, who is retiring as Executive Chairman of our Board in May 2015 and who served as President and Chief Executive Officer until this past December. It was under Ken's leadership that our senior executive team: identified and articulated the key strategies to improve our business performance; first dared to set objectives beyond anything that the Company had achieved before; and consistently executed our initiatives so well that we have again reached and surpassed many of the financial objectives we set for ourselves. Ken has been an inspirational leader to everyone, as well as a friend, coach, and mentor to me. On behalf of our Board of Directors and the entire team at Foot Locker, I would like to offer Ken our deepest gratitude for his contributions to our Company over the last several years, and wish him all the best in his retirement.  As Ken and the Board have passed the responsibilities of Chief Executive Officer to me, the primary theme of this leadership transition is one of continuity. Our team remains focused on our vision: to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel. The strategic priorities that we describe throughout this report are also an evolution of the fundamental strategies that have led to our recent strong results. met several of the goals, and we were making substantial progress on the rest of them. As a consequence, in early 2012 we elevated the financial objectives to levels the Company had never before achieved. Now, three years later, I am very pleased to report that we continue to make excellent progress and have, once again, surpassed many of the key goals we set for ourselves, as shown below:
 Original 2012-2016  5-Year Plan Long-Term  2009Objectives2011 2014 Objectives

Sales (billions) $4.9 Sales per Gross Square Foot $333  Adjusted EBIT Margin  2.8% Adjusted Net Income Margin 1.8% Return on Invested Capital 5.3%

$6.0 $5.6 $7.2 $400 $406 $490 8.0% 7.9% 11.4% 5.0% 5.0% 7.3% 10.0% 11.8% 15.0%

$7.5 $500 11.0% 7.0% 14.0%

  In addition to the significant milestones listed above, we posted many other key financial records in 2014, including reaching $522 million of net income. This figure represented $3.58 of earnings per share, a 25 percent increase over 2013 and up more than six-fold compared to 2009. This bottom-line result was driven by our strong top-line performance, including an 8.0 percent comparable sales gain for the year. In fact, each of our U.S. and international divisions achieved a significant comparable sales gain. Excellent execution of our initiatives at every level of our organization drove these outstanding sales results, and it also enabled us to improve our gross margin rate to a record high of 33.2 percent, and our selling, general, and administrative expense rate to a record low of 19.9 percent.  There were many other major accomplishments during the year; too many, in fact, to describe in this letter, but let me call out just a few of the highlights of 2014:  We successfully completed the integration of Runners Point Group into our Company, and it contributed meaningfully to our sales and profits;  We continued to execute our remodel program across all of our banners, expand our vendor shop-in-shop programs, and further develop our exciting new women's format, SIX:02;  Between the store projects mentioned above and various technology and digital initiatives, we invested approximately $200 million of capital into the business during the year to improve our performance in the quarters and years ahead;

Progress Towards Financial Objectives
 Along with our vision and strategic priorities, the Company established an ambitious set of financial objectives in early 2010. At the time, we saw them as "stretch" targets, but just two years later, we had already

"Over the past few years, our Company has focused intently on executing our key strategies. That focus, along with the investments we have made in our stores, digital capabilities, support facilities, and -- most importantly -- our people, has enabled us to develop into a high-performance company."

 We developed and rolled out to the entire organization a new leadership model designed specifically for Foot Locker;  And we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Foot Locker banner, which started with a single store in California in 1974.

New Long-Term Financial Objectives
Along with the growth priorities outlined above, we have updated the long-term financial targets. We aspire to remain a top quartile performer, with:  Sales of $10 Billion by 2020  Sales per Gross Square Foot of $600  Earnings Before Interest and Taxes of 12.5% of Sales  Net Income of 8.5% of Sales  Return on Invested Capital of 17%  Inventory Turnover of 3+ times  We believe we have a very strong foundation and many strengths upon which to build our performance to reach these heights. With the strength of our team; our core values; our leading market positions in basketball, running, and casual footwear; our multiple banners and distribution channels; our geographic diversity; our solid financial position; and, finally, the powerful partnerships we have developed with our leading vendors, we believe we have the resources and capabilities to achieve these objectives and be a top performer, not just in the athletic industry, but in all of retail.

Revised Strategic Framework and Priorities
 In light of this progress, our senior leadership team recently completed a comprehensive evaluation of our opportunities -- over the near term, intermediate term, and long term -- to enhance our performance even further. As I noted above, our vision remains the same, as do the fundamental elements of our strategy. We have, however, revised the strategic framework within which to organize our growth initiatives and pursue our business priorities.

Enhanced Shareholder Returns
 As our business performance has grown, so has our Company's cash flow and our ability to return cash to shareholders while maintaining a strong, flexible financial position.  During 2014, we paid $127 million in shareholder dividends and spent $305 million to repurchase almost 5.9 million shares of our stock. The total shareholder returns of $432 million represent almost 85 percent of our annual net income for the year.  In February, we announced that our Board of Directors had approved a 14 percent increase to our dividend rate, effective with the dividend payment in the first quarter of 2015. This represents the fifth consecutive year in which our Board has authorized a meaningful increase to our dividend rate, which now stands at an even $1.00 per share on an annualized basis.  In February, the Board also authorized a new, $1 billion share repurchase program, as our previous program of $600 million, initiated just two years earlier, had largely been completed.  These decisions by our Board firmly demonstrate its confidence in our Company's ability to maintain a high level of financial performance in the years ahead and our commitment to our shareholders. 4

Core Business
 More specifically, our seven strategic priorities to build our business further are to:  Drive performance in the Core Business with compelling customer engagement  Expand our leading position in the Kids' business  Aggressively pursue European expansion opportunities  Build our Apparel penetration and profitability  Build a more powerful Digital business with customerfocused channel connectivity  Deliver exceptional growth in our Women's business  Build on our industry-leading team by embracing the power of our People  The pages that follow will provide further insight into each of these priorities.

Conclusion
 Having joined Eastbay in 1993, four years before it was acquired by what is now Foot Locker, Inc., I have had the good fortune over the last 20 plus years to: contribute to the development of our very strong digital business; lead our highly profitable European business; and guide our industry-leading store businesses in the United States, and, in my role as Chief 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Operating Officer, around the world. From those experiences, I can assure you that it takes an incredibly strong and talented team to produce the consistent success Foot Locker, Inc. has demonstrated in recent years. We have produced 20 consecutive quarters of meaningful sales and profit increases, an enviable track record in any industry.  I want to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to all of our associates around the globe for their exceptional dedication and hard work that have gone into delivering those outstanding results.  We know that it also takes developing and strengthening relationships with our key partners, including our world-class merchandise vendors, our supportive landlords, and many other important suppliers, to reach the levels of success you are reading about in this report. I want to acknowledge and thank each of them for the innovation, support, and cooperation that they deliver every day to our business. I am also deeply grateful to our Board of Directors. Each member has contributed a deep reservoir of 5 knowledge and experience during our development into a high-performing company, and the management team and I look forward to their continuing guidance and support as we begin the next stage of our journey towards achieving our vision.  Additionally, I am excited about the opportunity to get to know many more of you, our shareholders. I sincerely appreciate the support you have shown the Company over the past several years, and I want to maintain the dialogue you have established with us as we continue to make progress executing our strategies and building a stronger business.  In conclusion, let me say that setting new targets is easy. Reaching those new targets, however, is not. Achieving new heights of operational and financial performance will only be possible through continuing to elevate our engagement with our customers, at every point of contact we have with them: in our stores, on their smart phones, on social media, on our websites, at athletic and sporting events, or wherever they may be. By doing so, and with the support of everyone throughout the organization, we believe we can accomplish the goal of selling just one more piece of apparel or pair of sneakers at a time: one more per store, per associate, per hour, or per website visit. By breaking down our Company's high-level goals into such bite-sized challenges to which every associate around the world can relate, we will achieve our vision -- to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel.
