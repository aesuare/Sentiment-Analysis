APPROACH TO POWER SUPPLY

zW

MANAGEMENT, Allegheny Electric Cooperative, Inc. has emerged as a clear leader in terms of affordability and stability in today's competitive energy environment.
In 2007, Allegheny Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Allegheny), the power provider for 14 electric distribution cooperatives in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, launched its innovative "Patchwork Quilt" strategy of power supply management. In use for the past six years, this approach involves entering into multiple energy and capacity agreements for different amounts and for different lengths of time. The agreements complement Allegheny's self-owned baseload generation assets. By diversifying in this way, Allegheny is not dependent on any single source for power supply. In 2012, the Patchwork Quilt approach continued to deliver benefits, helping Allegheny maintain one of the lowest generation rates in the region. Over the past several years, the strategy has helped Allegheny become an exceptionally dependable source of power supply for its members. In a time of intense market volatility, Allegheny's rates have been consistently less volatile than most investor-owned utility (IOU) rates. This is especially significant given the dramatic changes in the electricity marketplace in recent years. In 2011, a new era opened in Pennsylvania as the electric generation market in the state entered into full competition. This occurred when the remaining caps on IOU electric generation rates - initiated under the electric restructuring process that began in the mid-1990s - were lifted at the close of 2010. This era of "electric choice" has changed the landscape of power generation in the region. With the removal of rate caps, generation suppliers now operate in a fully competitive environment where rates can be influenced by industry and market changes. IOUs now compete with alternative electric generation suppliers (EGSs) for customers, who now have the option to

Unlike the IOUs, who sold off or transferred ownership of their generation assets under electric restructuring, Allegheny held onto its power resources. Today, this strong foundation in baseload * generation resources, combined with strategic power agreements, leaves Allegheny and its member cooperatives not nearly as affected by market volatility as the IOUs. As a result, Allegheny is able to deliver a competitive rate on a consistent basis. This diversified approach allows Allegheny to enjoy tremendous flexibility in operational and financial matters. Having this strategy in place has played a key role during events like maintenance outages at the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station nuclear facility in Luzerne County. During such outages, we are able to quickly secure alternative power resources to maintain reliability and mitigate the impact on rates

exemplifying the strategy in action.
The strategy also allows us the flexibility to take advantage of special opportunities. In 2012, Allegheny completed the process to become the sole owner of the Raystown Hydroelectric Project in Huntingdon a facility we have leased since it became operational in 1988. Only through our strong position were we able to respond quickly to this opportunity to acquire the facility, which continues to be a reliable County source of renewable energy for our cooperative members. Also in 2012, Allegheny quickly maneuvered to sell an option on Allegheny Locks & Dams 8 & 9, two runof-river hydroelectric facilities on the Allegheny River. Allegheny had an option to purchase the facilities in

2030, but chose to take advantage of an opportunity to sell this option. In assessing the future value of this option, it was determined that selling the option now would be of most benefit to Allegheny. In financial matters, Allegheny recorded another year of solid financial results in 2012. Our strong financial position allowed the retirement of $3.8 million in patronage capital to members in 2012, bringing the total

2QTHE YEAR INREVIEW 12I
Allegheny in 2012 continued to show the strength of its innovative Patchwork Quilt strategy of power supply management. The strategy involves securing power in different amounts, from different sources, for different periods of time. Developed over the past decade and launched in 2007, the plan helps further diversify Allegheny's power resources - all the more prudent, given the volatility of the energy market and difficult economic climate of the past few years. The Patchwork Quilt plan adds complementary pieces to a solid foundation of Allegheny-owned power resources. Combined with a strong financial position, Allegheny enjoys tremendous flexibility in being able to react to market changes and operational issues, including maintenance outages at our facilities. That strength allowed Allegheny in 2012 to continue to successfully achieve our core mission of stable and affordable wholesale power rates for our member cooperatives in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Here is a look at Allegheny's 2012 power supply portfolio: SUSQUEHANNA STEAM ELECTRIC STATION Allegheny owns 10 percent of the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station (SSES), a 2,600-megawatt, twounit nuclear power plant located in Luzerne County, Pa. PPL Susquehanna, a division of Allentown, Pa.based PPL Corporation, owns the remaining 90 percent and operates the boiling water reactor facility. In 2012, this 10 percent share of SSES provided 1.69 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity to Pennsylvania and New Jersey electric cooperatives. Considering dual unit outages, the capacity factor of Unit 1 was 68.9 percent; Unit 2 achieved a calendar year capacity factor of 81.2 percent. This corresponds to an average annual composite capacity factor for the facility of 75 percent. Both units experienced outages in 2012. Unit 1, considered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission since 2010 to be the largest boiling water reactor in terms of thermal power and generating capacity, was offline for a total of 99 days. During a planned refueling outage, Unit 1 underwent several major inspections and equipment replacements. These included inspecting and refurbishing jet pumps, and replacing drywall fans, steam relief valves, and hydraulic control units. Unit 2 was offline for a total of 48 days due to turbine inspections and unexpected mechanical issues. RAYSTOWN HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT Allegheny's Raystown Hydroelectric Project (Raystown) is a two-unit, 21-megawatt, run-of-river hydropower facility located at Raystown Lake and Dam in Huntingdon County, Pa. With near-normal rainfall in 2012, Raystown generated approximately 88 million kilowatt-hours, 3 percent higher than the annual goal of 85.4 million kilowatt-hours. The 2012 generation amount equates to 2.8 percent of Allegheny's requirements for the year. The plant maintained a 99.9 percent availability. In October 2011, Allegheny successfully completed the purchase of the lease agreement that had been in place since 1988 for the Raystown hydropower facility. As a result of the purchase, Allegheny became the lease owner while continuing in the position of the lessee. In 2012, staff continued efforts to eliminate other lease structure components and to reflect Allegheny as the sole Federal Energy Regulatory

Allegheny and its 14 member cooperatives continue to be very active in meeting consumer-members' desire to support energy efficiency, clean and renewable energy generation, and a secure energy future for electric cooperatives. In addition to Allegheny's investments in clean and carbon-free nuclear and hydropower resources, and our demand-side efficiency measures, here are some of our other initiatives for a better environment: INTERCONNECTED PROJECTS Allegheny and its member distribution cooperatives actively worked with cooperative consumermembers who were considering the addition of renewable energy projects to their homes or businesses. By the end of 2012, there were 285 consumer-member-owned renewable energy projects that had been interconnected, including six digesters, 53 wind turbines, 225 solar photovoltaic arrays, and one small hydroelectric facility. We expect to interconnect additional projects on a regular basis. See map on foldout, next page. RENEWABLE ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM As a positive partner in the Commonwealth's alternative energy initiatives, Allegheny provides a program to assist cooperative consumer-members who want to install a clean energy generation system at their home, farm or business. The Renewable Energy Assistance Program (REAP) provides grants to electric distribution cooperatives to help cover various interconnection costs, such as metering equipment and distribution transformers. The program also pays for certain transitional costs to help ensure that other electric cooperative consumer-members do not subsidize the operation or installation of small renewable energy generation systems such as anaerobic digesters, wind turbines, or solar units. Since 2006, REAP has provided nearly $489,000 in interconnection grants among 11 member cooperatives. In many ways, REAP reflects the electric cooperative tradition of members helping members, and continues to strengthen Allegheny's history of addressing environmental and energy challenges in a cost-effective and fair way.
