Letter to Shareholders

"...the power of our Company is not just our products, but the ideas, energy and passion of our employees."

This past year was the best in Cummins history. Record-setting results translated into an excellent total return for shareholders of 74.6 percent. The result was almost five times greater than the total return earned by our peer group and nearly seven times greater than the S&P 500 Index. When combined with our stock performance in 2003, total return for the last two years averaged 77 .4 percent. Meanwhile, our market capitalization ­ or stock price times outstanding shares ­ more than tripled in the past two years to $3.8 billion. Cummins businesses set an annual sales record of $8.4 billion, topping our prior peak in 1999 by 27 percent. Earnings before interest and taxes, net earnings and cash flow from operations were also record-setting. Earnings per share were $7 .39. These results were particularly gratifying because only two years ago, we were mired in one of the worst recessions I can remember in my 33 years with the Company. Two of our four businesses were losing money, our share price had dropped to $19, our debt was

downgraded to below investment grade and we were experiencing significant decreases in product demand. The difference between then and now rests largely with the actions taken by the people of Cummins. Once again, they illustrated that the power of our Company is not just our products, but the ideas, energy and passion of our employees. In the face of troubling financial times, they made a commitment to sharpen their cost-reduction skills, to pursue efficiency and process improvement and to rethink the Company's go-to-market strategies. This focus on execution, combined with a superior line of new products and an extensive service and distribution network, put Cummins in position to take advantage of the resurgence in the U.S. economy, as well as growing international opportunities. And we did. Business Unit performance for 2004 is reviewed, beginning on Page 8.

Business highlights include the following:

We produced more than 700,000 diesel engines worldwide, including shipments from consolidated and unconsolidated entities and record shipments of the popular turbo diesel engine for the Dodge Ram pickup truck. In the North American heavy-duty truck market, we experienced our most significant year-over-year share growth in the last 20 years. Our share of global joint venture earnings totaled $111 million ­ an increase of 59 percent over 2003. Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company in China provided us with a total return on investment in excess of 145 percent over the last 20 months. Consolidated and unconsolidated sales in China reached $1 billion in 2004, a year ahead of schedule.

Power Generation completed a turnaround year during which its earnings before interest and taxes grew from a $15-million loss in 2003 to $69 million of income in 2004. The International Distributor Business had record sales and earnings before interest and taxes, reflecting our strategic focus on less cyclical businesses. After being named to the Business Ethics magazine's top 100 companies the previous five years, we were named No. 1 for 2005 ­ a particularly gratifying honor.

Tim Solso enjoys spending time with a young student while visiting Cummins award-winning Child Development Center in Columbus, Indiana. Community involvement is one of the reasons the Company was honored by Business Ethics magazine as the 2005 "Top Corporate Citizen. " Cummins was selected for the award from among the nation's top 1,000 companies for its commitment to shareholders, communities, minorities and women, environment, non-U.S. stakeholders, customers and employees.

The coming years hold similar promise for Cummins. We expect our markets to remain strong for the next several years, and we are implementing strategies that will not only maximize our success during good times, but also help us weather the next business cycle downturn. We will follow a strategy that focuses on being the low cost producer, taking advantage of growth opportunities, building on existing businesses and creating an

environment that both attracts and retains outstanding people and motivates them to deliver superior performance. Our successful Six Sigma program will continue to drive cost savings and quality improvements, while serving as a leadership development tool for employees. We also will expand our global sourcing efforts. We will take advantage of our improved balance sheet and strengthened markets by investing wisely in growth opportunities around the world. These investments will be strategic and will cut across all of our businesses.

We will build on our already strong presence outside the United States. In particular, China and India remain fertile ground for our operations ­ our second largest customer is in China and third largest is in India. More than 6,000 Cummins employees work in those two countries. We also opened a technical center in Pune, India, in January 2004 and later in the year announced plans for a technical center in Wuhan, China.

Other opportunities for profitable growth include retail distribution, aftermarket sales and service, lightduty automotive, emission solutions and generators in underdeveloped international markets. While we look to the future, we will retain the solid framework of our past. For 85 years, the Cummins brand has stood for innovation, honesty and dependability. We have always placed a premium on integrity and fairness in dealings with all of our stakeholders. That will not change. The genesis of the Cummins personality can be traced to one man ­ Joseph Irwin Miller. Although Mr. Miller passed away in 2004, his legacy will continue to form the building blocks of our success. A tribute to Mr. Miller appears on the opposite page.

I would like to express my deep gratitude to Bill Ruckelshaus, who is leaving our Board of Directors after 30 years of service to Cummins shareholders and the Company. Mr. Ruckelshaus has had a remarkable career, combining law, public service and corporate leadership. His reasoned approach and counsel were greatly appreciated at Cummins. His thoughtful perspectives and insights will be missed. In conclusion, let me thank you, our Cummins shareholders, for your investment and confidence in the business. I also want to express my gratitude to the members of the Board of Directors for their valued service and counsel, to our employees around the world for their commitment to excellence, to the many business partners who have contributed to our success and to our customers for the opportunity to provide them with outstanding products and services.

Tim Solso Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Cummins Inc.
