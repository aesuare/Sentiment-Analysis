Letter to Shareholders
We had a solid year in fiscal 2016, despite a somewhat more challenging sales environment in the second half of the year. For the first time in a fiscal year, we opened 14 stores and sold over one million vehicles. We grew total revenues by more than 6% to $15 billion and increased earnings per diluted share by 11% to $3.03.
We sold approximately 620,000 retail vehicles and more than 394,000 wholesale vehicles at our auctions, a total increase of 6% compared with fiscal 2015. CAF income increased by 7% in fiscal 2016, to $392 million, and our auto loan portfolio grew to more than $9.5 billion by year end. We ended the year with a total of 158 stores and anticipate a continuation of our robust opening schedule, planning to open 15 stores in fiscal 2017.
This is an exciting time for CarMax, as we’re in the midst of opening stores in several major metropolitan markets. In fiscal 2016, we entered Boston and Minneapolis and expanded our presence in Denver and Philadelphia. In fiscal 2017, we’ll be entering San Francisco, and we plan to enter Seattle the following year.
The CarMax Difference. Our customers continue to give us high marks for exceptional customer service and we’re proud of the enhancements we’ve put in place as we’ve grown our base of stores. But, as our long-time shareholders know, we’re never satisfied. Our ongoing goal is to meet customers where and how they want to do business, regardless of where they are in their shopping journey or how they choose to interact with CarMax.
We know that nearly 90% of our customers have visited one of our digital properties prior to their vehicle purchase, and by the end of fiscal 2016 more than half of total visits to carmax.com came from our mobile site or mobile applications. We want to ensure that these customers receive the same superior customer experience online that they’ve always received in our stores. We’re just concluding the process of rolling out a new adaptive and more personalized website redesign. We also will continue to test different components of the selling process online to better understand our customers’ needs - and enable a seamless web-to-store customer experience. CarMax will continue to distinguish itself as a true provider of an omni-channel experience in the auto industry.
We’re also never satisfied with our execution. We’ll continue to focus on becoming more efficient and reducing waste throughout the company. We’ll continue to equip our associates with the tools they need to make their job easier. For example, we appraise more than 2 million vehicles each year, and a new mobile appraisal platform will help our buyers reduce appraisal time and increase accuracy. We’re also developing an improved transportation system that will help us realize efficiencies when moving the millions of vehicles we ship annually. It’s this kind of continuous improvement that has driven our success in the past and that will support our innovations in the future.
Associate Development. For the twelfth consecutive year, we were delighted to be named by Fortune magazine as one of its “100 Best Companies to Work For.” Our associates take pride in maintaining the strong CarMax culture of innovation, respect and integrity – and are dedicated to cultivating that culture as we continue to expand across the country. By investing in the well-being of our associates, which is our greatest competitive

differentiator, we’re investing in the success of the company. CarMax was also named to Training magazine’s Top 125 for the ninth consecutive year. This honor is awarded to companies with the best leadership development, outstanding training initiatives and demonstrable training program results. We take an individualized approach to training and development that ensures every associate is equipped to provide an exceptional customer experience and has the opportunity to reach their full potential. Our best-in-class training approach consists of bite sized learning and applied on-the-job practice. Over the past year, training enhancements included expansion of our nationally recognized Summit Leadership Program, as well as an enhanced focus on critical problem solving skills for our store senior management.
Delivering Value to Shareholders. In October 2012, CarMax’s Board of Directors approved the company’s first share repurchase program. Since that time, the Board has authorized share repurchases of up to $3.8 billion. As of the end of fiscal 2016, we had repurchased more than 46.4 million shares at a total cost of $2.4 billion. This program reflects both our confidence in our company’s future and our ongoing commitment to increase shareholder value.
CarMax Cares. Since its inception in 2003, The CarMax Foundation has granted more than $30 million to communities where our associates live and work, including $5.8 million in fiscal 2016 alone. The Foundation has become an integral part of the CarMax culture with 100% of our locations organizing at least one volunteer team builder annually, and, in fiscal 2016, we completed more than 1,000 total volunteer events.
During the year, the Foundation also completed a 3-year, $4.1 million partnership with KaBOOM!. Together, we built 31 playgrounds across the U.S., making play possible for more than 100,000 children. In fiscal 2017, the Foundation launched a new $5 million partnership with KaBOOM! to support play for an additional 200,000 youth.
CarMax also announced other new commitments in fiscal 2016. In an effort to support veterans and their families as they transition from military service to civilian life, we’re partnering with two important organizations, Hiring Our Heroes and The Mission Continues. Hiring Our Heroes is a program of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation that helps veterans, service members and military spouses find meaningful employment opportunities. The Mission Continues empowers veterans to find new missions through community service. We are proud to support these organizations.
CarMax also recently became a national Disaster Responder Partner of the American Red Cross. By providing funding prior to disasters, CarMax helps ensure the Red Cross is able to provide help to those affected by disaster in the communities where our associates live and work.
Executive Succession. In February, we announced that as the culmination of a multi-year management succession plan, Bill Nash had been promoted to president. After my 23 years at CarMax, including 10 years as CEO, I plan to retire prior to the end of calendar 2016, at which time we anticipate that Bill will assume the role of CEO. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my long tenure at CarMax, during most of which I’ve worked closely with Bill, and I believe he and the entire leadership team are the right group to guide the company through the next phase of our growth and development.
In Appreciation. Once again this year I’d like to close my letter with an expression of sincere gratitude to our more than 22,000 associates, who remain our greatest asset. Their service, hard work and support, as well as their enduring dedication to giving our customers the best experience possible, have been the foundation on which CarMax’s success has been built. Of course, I also want to thank all of CarMax’s customers, communities, shareholders and friends for their ongoing loyalty.
