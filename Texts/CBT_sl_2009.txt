 Letter to Shareholders
Dear fellow shareholders,
The global economic slowdown of 2009 dramatically affected our business performance, created tremendous uncertainty and led to one of the most difficult financial years in Cabot's history. The downturn also took its toll on our customers, employees and share- holders. Through it all, I have been impressed with our company's ability to rise to the challenges, execute with razor sharp intensity, maintain a long-term focus, and plan for better days.
Developing and executing a comprehensive plan early in the crisis in many ways allowed us to take our fate into our own hands. Notwithstanding the unprecedented times, we were able to further our global strategy and stay on track to deliver on our long-term goals.
2009 in Review
For many years, safety has been a critical element of our suc- cess. During 2009, we continued to perform at a world class level, ending the year with our best ever safety record. Our total record- able incident rate (TRIR)* was 0.36. This is a significant improve- ment from last year’s 0.47 and puts us in the top tier of chemical companies worldwide. We also continue to make solid progress in reducing the risk of process safety events. We hold steadfast to our belief that all safety incidents are preventable and remain commit- ted to our goal of zero incidents.
The environmental area is becoming ever more critical to our busi- nesses, and, in 2009, we reduced our environmental non-confor- mances by 40%. Also during the year, we participated for the first time in the Carbon Disclosure Project, which publishes greenhouse gas emissions data for over 3,000 global companies. The compari- son of our greenhouse gas program positioned us well against our

peers. We are actively working on multiple technology projects that have both financial and environmental performance benefits in the long-term. This remains an important strategic area for us.
On the financial front, for fiscal 2009 we recorded a loss per share of $1.23, including $1.38 per share of charges from certain items. This is compared to earnings of $1.34 per share in fiscal 2008, including $0.15 per share of charges from certain items. Our financial performance in 2009 was mainly affected by volumes in our key end markets, which dropped by as much as 30 to 40% at their lowest point.
In response to the crisis, and keeping our long-term goals in mind, we implemented a restructuring of our operations. We developed thorough market-based scenarios that led to the actions we put in place. We acted early with a targeted program as we saw the potential for an extended slowdown. Our program required closing several of our manu- facturing sites, each of which has been part of our company for many years. As a result of these closures, we saw the departure of many of our valued colleagues and friends. These decisions were difficult but necessary to ensure our future. Throughout the planning, our objective was to maximize results without sacrificing our ability to compete once
a recovery commenced. As such, we mothballed or curtailed capacity
in certain geographies on a temporary basis to ensure we could restart operations quickly when demand increased. We also maintained invest- ment in our highest value R&D projects, new business opportunities, and capacity expansions in emerging regions.
Our expected fixed cost savings from the restructuring, which will exceed $80 million, will be fully achieved in fiscal 2010. This provides us a more efficient platform from which to compete. The one-time costs to implement the plan were originally estimated to be $150 million. Through strong discipline and project focus, we were able to reduce these costs to approximately $115 million.
During the year, we reaffirmed our financial targets of $3 of adjusted earnings per share by 2012 and a 13% adjusted return on invested capi- tal by 2014. The weak economic environment caused us to extend our initial timing to achieve these targets by one year. Given the strength of our company and the strategic initiatives underway, we are confident in

Business Performance
Fiscal 2009 was a difficult year for our core businesses principally as a result of very weak volumes and disruptive feedstock and finished product inventory effects. On a positive note, however, our new business efforts produced continual improvements despite the weak economic environment.
Core Segment
In the Rubber Blacks business, a combina- tion of decreased demand and customer de- stocking in the tire and automotive markets resulted in volumes that were 20 to 30% below last year's levels. We maintained our resolve to eliminate the effects of the con- tract lag volatility on our business profitabili- ty and during 2009 we reduced the percent- age of our volumes subject to the lag from 50% to 25%. We anticipate further progress in this area during 2010. We also continue to invest in new product and process technology with both near- and long-term value creation potential.
The severe downturn in the electronics industry in early 2009 depressed demand for our products in the Supermetals business. We kept this business on a clear cash maxi- mization path during the year, generating $39 million in 2009. We have also further restructured our operations with the aim of improving our performance in 2010.
Performance Segment
Due to its reliance on the automotive, construction and electronics industries, the Performance segment experi- enced a sharp decline in its volumes with levels 30 to 40% below 2008. The high value we bring to our cus- tomers' applications and the superior quality and serv- ice relationships we have built with our customers over the years allowed us to maintain margins through the downturn. We continue to enhance our marketing and applications development capabilities as market-focused partnerships with our customers are key to the develop- ment of new and improved products.
New Business Segment
In 2008, we recommitted ourselves to improving the performance of the New Business segment. Our focus on key projects and more near-term delivery of growth increased revenue by 16% and cash flow by $43 million in 2009. We are pleased with our prioritized pipeline of opportunities and anticipate building on this success in 2010.
Specialty Fluids Segment
The Specialty Fluids segment produced solid results during the year despite the economic crisis, a testament to the value added nature of our technology. We again made progress in expanding our geographic reach, increasing the percentage of revenue from business out- side of the North Sea to 29%, up from 21% in 2008.
From a corporate perspective, our cash and liquidity position remained solid throughout 2009. We significantly reduced working capital and maintained a strong balance sheet. This enabled us to retain our BBB+/Baa1 credit ratings. In September, we raised $300 million in long- term public debt on very favorable terms. These accom-

2010 and Beyond
Since January 2009 we have seen consistent sequential improvement in our volumes and operating results driven by increased demand in our key end mar- kets. The improvements have been particularly strong in the emerging markets of China, South America and Southeast Asia where we are well positioned. As a result, in August we commissioned the expansion of our carbon black capacity in Tianjin, China, making it the largest and most technologically advanced carbon black facility in the world.
In all, 2009 was a significant test for our organization and given the complexity of the challenge, I am proud of the Cabot team and its performance. We were not pleased with our financial performance or its impact on our shareholders. However, the speed of our response and the early delivery of our cost reductions reaffirmed our team’s strong capabilities. Our decisive and well- implemented actions in 2009, our continued invest- ments in emerging markets, our focus on energy recov- ery technology and our new business development suc- cesses position us well for the future. I have full confi- dence in our ability to achieve our strategic objectives and long-term financial targets.
As we begin 2010, we will maintain our focus on the key elements of our success: safety, innovation, perform- ance and customers. Cabot remains a unique company and one that I believe is stronger now than it was before the economic downturn. We look to the coming year with optimism and sincerely thank you for your contin- ued interest and investment.
