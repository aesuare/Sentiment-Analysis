To our shareholders:

Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer
      2005 WAS ANOTHER RECORD YEAR FOR GENUINE PARTS COMPANY.
TOTAL SALES FOR THE YEAR ROSE TO $9.8 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 8% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS FOLLOWS AN 8% INCREASE IN 2004 AND WE CONTINUE TO BE ENCOURAGED BY THE SALES PROGRESS BEING MADE THROUGHOUT MOST PARTS OF THE COMPANY. NET EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR WERE $437 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 11% AND EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $2.50, ALSO UP 11%. WITH THESE RESULTS, WE HAVE NOW INCREASED SALES IN 55 OF THE LAST 56 YEARS AND INCREASED PROFITS IN 43 OF THE LAST 45 YEARS. THIS IS A RECORD THAT WE ARE PROUD OF AND WE FEEL THAT IT SHOWS THE STABILITY AND CONSISTENCY OF GENUINE PARTS COMPANY.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH
Our financial condition was further strengthened in 2005. Through continued focus on asset management, our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.0/1 at year-end and working capital as a per- cent to sales was 26%. We also generated strong cash flow again in 2005 with approximately $440 million in cash flow from operations for the year. Our long-term debt remained at $500 million and our total debt to total capitalization ratio is 16%.
During the year, we used our cash to purchase 2.8 million shares of our Company stock. We continue to view this as a good use of cash and, as of December 31, 2005, we have 3.2 million shares remaining in our current authorization. We will continue to make opportunistic share purchases in 2006. We also invested $86 million in capital expenditures in our businesses and we returned $216 million to shareholders through dividends paid in 2005.
DIVIDENDS
The Company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948 and in 2005 we increased our dividend to $1.25 per share, representing our 49th consecutive year of increases. The Board of Directors, at its meeting on February 20, 2006, raised
the cash dividend payable April 1, 2006 by 8% to an annual rate of $1.35 per share, or 54% of our 2005 earnings. 2006 will be our 50th consecutive year of dividend increases.
PROGRESS IN OPERATIONS
We are pleased to report that each of our four business segments contributed to the progress made in 2005. Our strongest results came from Motion Industries, our Industrial distribution company. Their sales increased 11% in the year, which follows an 11% increase in 2004, so business has been good for the Industrial operations for the past two years. And, importantly, the outlook for Motion is positive for 2006 as well. Motion Industries serves the manufacturing sector of the economy and the current Industrial Production and Manufacturer Capacity Utilization indices point to continued strength for this sector in the year ahead. EIS, our Electrical/Electronic segment, also serves the manufacturing segment and they reported a sales increase of 2% for the year. EIS sold their Circuit Supply Division in April of 2005, which impacted their overall growth rate. The ongoing EIS operations were up 9% for the year, following a 13% increase in 2004 and EIS will also benefit from the strength in the manufacturing sector in 2006.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products Company, improved sales by 8%
for the year. This is a solid increase for this Group and it reflects the success of their product and customer expansion strategy. These efforts will continue into 2006 and, combined with favorable external factors such as ongoing healthy GDP growth rates, growth in white-collar employment and improved office occupancy rates, we are optimistic about continued solid growth in the Office Products Group.
Finally, Automotive, our largest business group, increased sales 6% in 2005, following a 6% increase in 2004. Good progress was made within our core NAPA operations but this was offset somewhat by the sale of eight of the twelve Johnson Industries operations that occurred over the course of the year. Ongoing Automotive operations were +7% and we are encouraged by the continued effectiveness of our growth initiatives in this Group. Additionally, the increase in total vehicles on the road, the age and mix of the vehicles, the number
of licensed drivers and miles driven are all positive indicators for our Automotive growth plans in 2006.
Before concluding our remarks on the operations, we would like
to comment on the impact of the hurricanes that occurred in the Southeastern part of the country in the latter part of the year. In the cases of hurricanes Rita and Wilma, we consider ourselves fortunate, as we came through these storms reasonably well. In the case of hur- ricane Katrina, we experienced varying degrees of disruption and damage in all four of our businesses and although we are not quite back to normal operating conditions in certain areas, our employees have done a remarkable job in keeping our operations running and providing essential services. The majority of the employees working in this part of the country were affected personally by the storm and through a relief effort funded by fellow GPC team members and matched by the Company, we are providing financial, as well as personal assistance, to those in need as they continue to rebuild their lives. Hundreds of GPC team members throughout our entire organi- zation, have played an important role in helping our people, our customers and our operations through this unfortunate situation. We are deeply grateful to each of them and we are extremely proud of all of them.
GPC DIRECTORS
James B. Williams will be retiring from our Board in April of 2006. Jimmy is the retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of SunTrust Bank and he has served on our Board since 1980. We are grateful to Jimmy for his dedicated service to Genuine Parts Company and we thank him for the outstanding counsel and guidance that he has provided to the Company. He has been a great contributor to our Board and we will miss his involvement.

 At the April 17, 2006 Shareholders’ Meeting, we are asking the shareholders to elect two new Directors. The GPC Board, at its scheduled meeting in November 2005, elected Gary W. Rollins and Jerry W. Nix to serve on our Board and invited them to be nominees for election by the shareholders. Mr. Rollins is Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer of Rollins, Inc. in Atlanta, Georgia. Mr. Nix has served as Executive Vice President- Finance and Chief Financial Officer of Genuine Parts Company and with his election to the Board, he was named Vice Chairman. Gary and Jerry offer us a wealth of knowledge and they are sure to be valuable members of our Board. We are fortunate to have them serve with us and we look forward to their contributions in the coming years.
MANAGEMENT
This year, it is a great honor to recognize the significant contribu- tions of Larry Prince, who retired from Genuine Parts Company on March 31, 2005. During Larry’s 46 years with the Company, his sin- cere interest in the well being of Genuine Parts and its employees, customers and shareholders was evident throughout his service. As CEO for 16 years, his impressive leadership was influential in the growth and success of the Company. Today, Larry remains on our Board as Chairman of the Executive Committee and we look for- ward to his continued interest, advice and counsel as we proceed into the future. We thank you, Larry, for your many contributions to Genuine Parts Company.
During this past year, there were a number of other management changes and promotions that we would like to share with you.
In March 2005, Michael D. Orr joined S.P. Richards as Senior Vice President of Logistics and Operations. Mike has extensive experi- ence in the logistics area and he is an excellent addition to the Office Products Group.
In August 2005, Motion Industries promoted Thomas L. Miller to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Robert J. Summerlin to Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Tom and Bob have both had long and impressive careers with Motion and these two promotions give additional depth and strength to the Motion management team. In their new positions, Tom and Bob will play key roles in the overall leadership of Motion Industries in the years ahead. Motion also appointed sev- eral new Group Vice Presidents as they expanded their U.S. region- al alignment. Joining David James, Southeast, and Mark Sheehan, Central, are Tim Breen, Midwest, Jeff Rouse, East, Kevin Storer, West, and John Walters, Southwest. This group represents a strong leadership team with a successful track record at Motion and we look forward to their future contributions.
Within the Automotive Group, Balkamp President, William E. “Gene” Turnbull, retired in February of this year. Gene has successfully held several key positions within the Automotive Group over his 35-year career and most recently he has provided outstanding
leadership to the Balkamp organization. We thank Gene for his many contributions to our Company and we wish him the very best in his retirement. To replace Gene, Scott W. LeProhon has been promoted to President of Balkamp. Scott is an 18-year veteran of the Company and over the years he has held several important management positions within the Automotive Group. To further position Balkamp for continued strong performance in the coming years, Frank C. Amato has been promoted to Executive Vice President-Operations and Donald T. “Tip” Tollison has been pro- moted to Executive Vice President-Administration. Both Frank and Tip are experienced Automotive Group executives and we are pleased to have them in their new positions.
J. Richard Borman was named President of Rayloc in February 2006. Rick has been with the Company for over 20 years, most recently as Executive Vice President at Rayloc, and he will provide good leadership to this organization.
And, finally, we are pleased to tell you that at our February 2006 Board meeting, the Directors elected Scott C. Smith to Senior Vice President-Corporate Counsel, Carol B. Yancey to Senior Vice President-Finance and Corporate Secretary and Sidney G. Jones to Vice President-Investor Relations. All three of these individuals have been with the Company for a number of years and these promotions will further strengthen our corporate legal and financial teams.
CONCLUSION
As we look back over 2005, we are pleased with the progress that was made throughout our Company and you can read more about this, by segment, in the pages that follow. We enter 2006 with optimism and enthusiasm and with a commitment through- out our organization to strive for further improvement
in the year ahead. Our focus, across all of our business segments, is to maintain our level of revenue growth, further improve our operating margins, and continue to enhance our asset manage- ment and working capital efficiencies.
