Clorox Shareholders and Fellow Employees: Our 2010 performance was excellent. I believe our performance demonstrates we have the right strategy to effectively manage our business and drive profitable growth in any economic environment.
We had a great year. We continued to make significant progress on our Centennial Strategy, which we introduced three years ago to define our areas of focus and targets through 2013 when the company turns 100. We delivered top-line growth and met or exceeded our annual targets for gross margin, earnings and economic profit growth in a very challenging economic environment:  :H JUHZ VDOHV  SHUFHQW WR  ELOOLRQ ([FOXGLQJ the impact of a significant currency devaluation in Venezuela*, sales would have grown 3 percent, consistent with our volume growth of 3 percent.  :H LQFUHDVHG JURVV PDUJLQ E\  EDVLV SRLQWV WR  SHUFHQW QHDULQJ D \HDU KLJK  :H JHQHUDWHG FRVW VDYLQJV RI DERXW  PLOOLRQ LQ cost of goods sold, which was in line with our fiscal  WDUJHWHG UDQJH RI  PLOOLRQ WR  PLOOLRQ  :H DFKLHYHG  GLOXWHG HDUQLQJV SHU VKDUH (36 YHUVXV  GLOXWHG (36 LQ ILVFDO  DQ LQFUHDVH of 12 percent on top of 17 percent growth in the prior year.  :H FRQWLQXHG WR EXLOG RQ RXU KLVWRU\ RI VWURQJ FDVK flow, a Clorox hallmark, with an increase of 11 percent in cash provided by operations.

Here are just a few examples of how we focused on the 3Ds to achieve such strong results: Desire: In addition to strong traditional advertising, we increased our presence in other communication channels to meet our consumers where they're most receptive to our messages.

You're now as likely to see our brands on Facebook as you are on daytime television. Decide: Our commitment to strategic partnerships with retailers has helped ensure we are well positioned on store shelves, where most purchase decisions are made. Retailers appreciate the innovation and focused consumer communication we bring to our categories, as well as our strong capabilities in category advisory services where we advise retailers on assortment, shelving, merchandising and pricing decisions to maximize the potential of a category. This was reflected in our No. 7 ranking among our top strategic partners in the most recent Cannondale Associates PoweRanking survey, which asks retailers to rank more than 100 manufacturers on a number of dimensions.
