My Family. My Family Dollar.
Since opening our first store in 1959, Family Dollar has provided our customers with value and convenience. For nearly a half a century, we have invested considerable resources to increase our understanding of our customer to better meet her needs. To better reflect our commitment to our customer, we set out to refresh the Family Dollar brand. Our new logo and tag line, reinforce our promise of providing customers with value and convenience and emphasize our focus on families. Our new brand illustrates our customer's emotional tie with Family Dollar and our commitment to meeting her needs. Our customers love our stores and consider us to be part of their families. When Mom walks into her neighborhood Family Dollar, we know she'll find what she needs for her home and family. In the face of tough economic headwinds, our mission to be a compelling place to shop, work and invest is more important than ever. Our customer knows she can count on us for value and convenience, so we're focused on making sure we're stocking the things she uses everyday. Family Dollar is developing talented teams focused on delivering strong performance. It takes the right people working together to effectively rise to the challenges we face in today's environment. Although we're not immune to external economic pressures, we are committed to managing risk and containing costs while also maintaining our commitment to investing in the people, process and technology that move our business forward. As we begin our 50th year of providing value and convenience to our customers, we will continue to focus our efforts to be a compelling place to shop for our customers, to work for our Associates and to invest for our shareholders.
