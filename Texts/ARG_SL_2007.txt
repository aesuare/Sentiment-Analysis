To our shareholders,
customers, associates, and friends:
By any measurement, fiscal 2007 was the best year in our 25-year history. A strong U.S. economy, a favorable pricing environment driven by higher energy costs and tight supply conditions, and solid execution by Airgas associates led to record earnings and cash flow. On an adjusted basis, we grew earnings 30 percent to $2.00 per diluted share from continuing operations. Net EPS grew to $1.92. Return on capital improved 150 basis points to 13.3 percent. Total revenues grew 13 percent to $3.2 billion.
It was also a record year for acquisitions, with more than $335 million in acquired revenue in 13 transactions, including important core acquisitions of Aeriform and Union Industrial Gas Group. The year’s largest acquisition added the divested Linde U.S. bulk gas business, which now operates as Airgas Merchant Gases. The product-line acquisition of CFC Refimax added refrigerant supply and reclamation offerings to Airgas Specialty Products, further leveraging our infrastructure. At year-end, we announced the Linde packaged gas acquisition, the largest in our 25-year history, which will add another $346 million in acquired revenue, ensuring that fiscal 2008 will be another record year for acquisitions.
And to top it all off, we celebrated our 25th Anniversary in 2007. Recently, Les Graff, Airgas’ senior vice president of corporate development, asked me, “What was the most exciting time in Airgas’ 25-year history?” I thought about it for two or three seconds and answered, “Now!” We both laughed, because we both knew I would have answered the same way two years ago, 10 years ago, or back in 1982 when Tom Mason and I founded the company.
It has always been that way at Airgas. We focus on making Airgas better right “Now!”—by winning new customers, by adapting new technology, and by getting more efficient and effective in every aspect of our business. Airgas truly is a “Now!” kind of company. We are mindful of our history and that of our industry, and we have looked back to learn from our mistakes. We also look to the future and have developed forward-thinking strategies that have changed our industry in the past quarter-century. Yet, we spend most of our time executing on current opportunities. We feel a sense of urgency to move forward, and we do! That is why “Now!” is my favorite time at Airgas, and why I start this letter by telling you what is happening right “Now!” After that, I will look back on our 25 years and highlight those things most important to our success. So, let’s begin, right “Now!”
Airgas Right Now
As I write this letter, we are preparing to complete the biggest acquisition in our history. The addition of Linde’s U.S. packaged gas business will strengthen our core packaged gas business with another 130 locations in 18 states, filling out our network in the key Pittsburgh- to-Chicago corridor, and strengthening our presence in other important geographies in the eastern U.S.
 With the planned acquisition of Linde’s U.S. packaged gas busi- ness, the latest — and largest — acquisition in our history, Airgas will soon have more than 1,000 facilities in the U.S., plus loca- tions in Canada, Mexico, the Sakhalin Islands of Russia, and Dubai in the Middle East. Our locations include branches, cylin- der gas fill plants, specialty gas labs, air separation plants, other production facilities, and distribution centers.
That’s a far cry from Airgas’ first days in business 25 years ago when our presence was limited to a small corner of Connecticut. Now, we have sites in nearly every state, including Alaska
and Hawaii. This comprehensive geographic coverage means we can provide large national customers with consistent service at all of their sites and still know the names—and meet the
needs — of our smaller local customers.

In specialty gases, we have named the former president of Airgas East, Jim Muller, to a new role of senior vice president for specialty gases and life sciences. He will help our regions tap the full potential of the industry’s largest network of specialty gas facilities. Through acquisition, innovation, and internal growth, we have created an unrivaled network with eight national laboratories, almost 60 regional specialty gas labs, an R&D center and a specialty gas equipment center. Our patented AcuGravTM specialty gas mixing stations automate the production of specialty gas mixes, especially EPA Protocols. We also now have proprietary technology that automates the analysis of these mixes, which has dramatically improved our ability to deliver accurate, consistent product to customers. As a result of the improvements we have made in our specialty gas capabilities over the last several years, this part of our business is growing nicely.

25 Years of Airgas
Actually, I cannot believe it has been 25 years since the first acquisition of Connecticut Oxygen Corporation in February 1982. It seems like only yesterday that we finished our first fiscal year with $3.2 million in sales. And now, we are approaching $4 billion in sales annually. It has been non-stop excitement since 1982.
Airgas is known for our nearly 360 acquisitions over the years. The Air Products and BOC
packaged gas businesses, and Linde’s divested U.S. bulk gas business are three of our
largest acquisitions. We have also made product line acquisitions in medical, safety products,
welder rentals$,1p50rocess chemicals and carbon dioxide, and$2m00any acquisitions of independent $425 industrial gas a$n14d0 welding supply distributors.

 At our core, Airgas is the same company we were in 1982,
when we were delivering packaged gas and welding equipment
to a small group of industrial companies in Connecticut. Today,
Airgas is still providing cylinders to some of those original
customers—and many more companies just like them. Yet,
through the years, we have expanded into product adjacencies

Many of our best people and best practices have come from the companies we have acquired. Everyone at Airgas has an acquisition story to tell. Thankfully, most of the stories are good ones, because we have been disciplined on price and have resisted assuming liabilities. We have always welcomed employees from acquisitions and have been open to new ideas. Airgas has earned its reputation for successfully acquiring and integrating companies.
We have also become a strong operating company with a lot of hard work and discipline through the years. In 1998, we embarked on the Repositioning for Growth strategy to strengthen our operating culture and build an infrastructure that would support growth. Looking back at the 1998-2002 period, that was the most challenging chapter in our history, made even more difficult by a weak U.S. industrial economy and the dot.com lunacy on Wall Street. While we took the long view by pursuing a consistent strategy and building the infrastructure we needed to grow, we watched our stock price drop from the $20s to below $5. We even attracted an “activist” investor, who filed a shareholder proposal challenging our strategic direction.
When the dust settled, Airgas had outperformed almost every chemical and distribution company during that period. Moreover, the Airgas strategies to pursue above-market growth to non-cyclical customers and to be the low-cost supplier turned out to be exactly what Airgas needed. We have proven that it pays to take the long view by developing long-term strategies and sticking to them until we win.
There are many examples of forward-looking strategies that have rewarded us, including core and product-line acquisition strategies. Our Airgas Direct Industrial (ADI) strategy included work to rationalize our product offerings through a brand strategy for hardgoods and safety products, including our Radnor® private-label program; a network of large regional distribution centers; purchasing centers; and demand-planning software to manage the hardgoods supply chain. Other winning strategies included a Strategic Accounts approach to large, multi-site customers, adding product specialists for our strategic growth products, and our Core Strategy to reinvigorate our focus on small- to medium-sized customers served by our branches.
We have learned a lot over these 25 years.
• Operating strategies must change as conditions in the economy, the customer base, technology and competition change. But having a consistent organizational structure, compensation philosophy and financial analysis methodology is very important because it provides the framework within which to develop and execute new operating strategies.
• Alignment of operating strategies, metrics, and compensation from the bottom to the top of the organization is very important and requires constant attention.
• Doing the right thing and the best thing for the long haul are usually the same thing. Sticking to these guiding principles has served our associates, our customers and our shareholders very well.
 The Airgas strategy has evolved over the years, but we have never deviated far from our original vision of combining a nation- al footprint with local hands-on management. It’s a strategy
that gives us the best of both worlds, combining the strength of national resources with the agility of local entrepreneurship.
By following this blueprint, Airgas has become the leader in packaged gas in the United States. It hasn’t always been easy. When you walk the line between cultivating a strong
entrepreneurial spirit and a shared Airgas culture, market condi- tions and balance sheet considerations can tempt you to tinker with the formula and lead you to tip too far to one side or the other. At Airgas, we’ve managed to find the right balance and proved that it is possible to be big and small at the same time. In fact, it’s the only strategy for success in our industry, where all service is local.

 NOW Airgas branches are fully stocked and staffed by product experts, like Harrisburg, PA branch associate Tom Ballos.
 Airgas branches are the “face” of our company — where customers come to buy welding hardgoods and safety supplies and where drivers load up their trucks with gas cylinders for their daily delivery routes. In 25 years, we have grown from a few branches in Connecticut to more than 700 retail locations across the U.S., in western Canada, and in Mexico.
The interior of the stores has evolved as well. In the early days, most Airgas branches were little more than warehouses with cash registers. Today, they are run like retail stores, staffed with product experts. Shelves are stocked with the most
commonly needed items that customers expect to find with
us. Cylinder inventory on the loading dock is kept up to date through automated software. Branch personnel take gases and welding classes so they can better answer customer questions. And, they are constantly introducing creative store displays
and events—like open houses and on-site safety demonstra- tions — that make their stores more customer-friendly. In a new breed of construction branches — 15 and counting — we stock everything the jobsite requires and staff the branches with construction specialists.

• Winning in the distribution business is about getting on base, not hitting home runs. Our people win with walks, broken-bat singles, doubles down the line. We have folks who will even lean over the plate and get hit by a pitch, if that is what it takes. We have watched a lot of companies in our industry, some with far greater resources than Airgas, swing for the fences and strike out.
• A healthy organization is one that empowers its associates, giving them autonomy and responsibility. Our associates don’t mind being held accountable for results because they know they can make it happen.
• Front-line associates in sales and operations generally know what’s best because they are closest to the customer. We actively seek their ideas.
• Most people want to grow personally and professionally. It is management’s job to create an environment where that can happen—one in which everyone feels respected, supported, and free to speak their minds.
A Great Company Built by Great People
Airgas’ success really does come down to people. The ‘Old Guard’ shareholders who were around before we went public were very supportive. Names like McClain, Kirk, Lewis, Harrison, Smith, Kessler, Turner, Sult, and Perkins come to mind. In addition, there have been a number of executives who played very important roles in the development of Airgas, including, Tom Mason, Ken Keeley, Merrill Stott, Hermann Knieling, Pat Baker, Bill Rice, Al Crichton, Jerry Baker, Ron Scott, and Gordon Keen. We will never forget people like John Musselman and Scott Melman, who have left their mark on our company and our hearts. Also, the Airgas Board of Directors has been very helpful along the way.
I feel honored that those people were part of our history, and I am confident that our company can live up to their legacy because of the great associates who are with us — right now.
People like Kathy Helmberger and Buzz Larson, who led their branches in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Faribault, Minnesota, respectively, to outstanding sales and safety results and earned our 2006 National Branch of the Year awards. I was delighted to share the podium at the New York Stock Exchange with these and other Airgas associates as we celebrated our 20th year as a public company on December 19, 2006. Airgas associates are proud to have generated a remarkable 20 percent annual compounded return to our shareholders for 20 years!
We have the best people in the industry. That has always been an unheralded strength of this company. Right now, we are planning to welcome another 1,400 new associates when the Linde packaged gas acquisition closes.
We also have added new faces to our board of directors and leadership ranks. In October 2006, John van Roden joined the Board. John is the former chief financial officer of P.H. Glatfelter Company and served in the same capacity for leading companies in the public
