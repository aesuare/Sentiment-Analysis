2011 YEAR IN REVIEW

Message From Our Chairman
Doug Oberhelman, Chairman and CEO
There are many who will look back at 2011 as a record year. It was certainly a great year, and I’m proud of the entire Caterpillar team from employees to dealers to suppliers. We’ve renewed our focus on customers and delivered some impressive results. But it’s not a record I want to celebrate – it’s a record I want to break. I look at 2011 as a foundational year. It’s a stake in the ground, a line in the sand, a milestone on our way to achieve our Vision 2020.
Throughout the recession that began in 2008 and lingered until 2010, we kept investing and said we wanted to hit the ground running as soon as possible when the economy and demand stabilized. We certainly did that! We’ve been acquiring, investing, expanding, growing, developing – those are the kind of words you want to hear in business. But those words indicate starting points, not end points. That means Caterpillar has a lot of work to do!
Fortunately, we know what we need to do. Our strategy is working. All we have to do is execute and maintain an absolute focus on our customers. We are here to help them succeed. It’s as simple as that.
But, our customers are anything but simple. They are literally powering and building the world. Our customers operate in every corner of the globe. They range in size from a small residential contractor with one Caterpillar machine to large multinational global mining customers with hundreds of machines working 24 hours a day seven days a week. Our power systems are used to power huge ships and oil rigs, and they provide back-up power to hospitals, just to name a few applications.
Our customers are diverse, but all have something in common – they all expect the best from Caterpillar. They expect the best quality, the best performance, the best productivity and more than anything, they expect the best value for the price they pay. We’ve got our work cut out for us to deliver on these expectations. That’s why we have to set the bar high.
As good as 2011 was, it’s not the new normal. We can do even better.

2011 YEAR IN REVIEW

Leadership Performance
When we introduced our 2011–2015 strategy, we talked to our teams about the need to look outside of Caterpillar. We often compare our performance to ourselves – not our competitors – from year to year. We compare our new products to older models. We compare results from Division to Division. There’s nothing wrong with that – it’s an effective way to show improvement. But it doesn’t help us figure out what our customers need, and it certainly doesn’t show us what the world needs.
Business has changed. The industries we serve have changed. Competition is tough, customer requirements are demanding, and the industries we serve are booming, and they are complicated. Outperforming ourselves simply isn’t good enough anymore.
That’s why asking the question – what does the world need? – is so important.
By 2020 the world population is expected to be 7.6 billion people. What are all those people going to need? They are going to need food, water, energy, housing, roads, schools – everything you and I have today and probably some new things we haven’t even thought of yet. That means infrastructure, construction, mining and power systems are growing industries. Demand for our products is strong, and we think the big macroeconomic trends will mean good global growth for our industries for the next 25-30 years. 2011 was about getting us ready to capitalize on all of that growth.
In 2011, we announced new distribution centers to keep up with growing parts demand. We completed the acquisitions of Bucyrus and MWM, which expands our mining and power systems portfolios. We introduced over 50 new Tier 4 products that not only meet emissions requirements, but deliver added value in terms of power, efficiency, safety and more. These new products run with the cleanest diesel engines ever made. We built new factories around the world and significantly expanded capacity in existing factories. In fact, in some cases we doubled capacity. Comparing ourselves from year to year, we did an amazing job. But the world wants more.
Despite the increases in capacity and expected additions in 2012, we are still very tight on many products and are currently quoting extended delivery times for some products. For example, we are now quoting delivery times into 2014 for some large trucks and track-type tractors.
That’s why we are setting the bar even higher for 2012.
While we have much to do in 2012, we’ll be particularly focused on four things – continuing to improve quality, our investment in product development, integrating our acquisitions and adding production capacity. In 2011 our investment in capital expenditures was $2.6 billion. In 2012, we expect capital expenditures of about $4 billion. We are transforming Caterpillar with an intense focus on customers, driving a reinvigorated sense of urgency as we invest and grow the company like never before.
We are also taking a close look at some areas that need improvement. When we developed our new Enterprise Strategy in 2010, we started by taking an honest look at ourselves. We asked: what are we doing well, and what do we need to work on? That’s not a one-time exercise, but something we need to do all the time.

2011 YEAR IN REVIEW

Leadership Performance
When we compare ourselves to the best in the auto industry, we just don’t stack up well when it comes to managing our inventory turns. Inventories have grown in our own factories, with our dealers and in our product distribution centers too. We came out of the recession with growth much stronger and faster than expected. I’m not one for passing up sales, so we really had to ramp up production quickly. I’m pleased that we are doing better at meeting demand, but I feel we can improve inventory turns and use less cash.
Again, we know what we need to do – we need to collaborate better with our suppliers. Sounds easy enough, but it requires a change in our culture. Caterpillar has been known to be arrogant in the past. Our customers have said it. Our dealers have said it. And our suppliers have probably felt it more than anyone. We’re changing that. Our suppliers are the best in the business, and we are going to leverage their expertise, communicate better and ensure we have the capacity and quality we need from our supply base. This is something I’m really going to push in 2012. I’m going to personally visit more suppliers, and I’m encouraging the rest of the Caterpillar team to do the same.
As I said, we are prepared to take a good, hard look at our company. It’s something we have to do in order to be successful. We encourage our dealers and suppliers to do the same – we can all work together better that way.
Governments also need to review their policies to ensure growth. “Business as usual won’t allow us to retain our leadership position. But extraordinary commitment – when backed by an external environment that fosters enterprise – will help Caterpillar and other U.S. firms compete successfully in the decade ahead.“ That’s a quote from Caterpillar’s Chairman Lee Morgan and President Bob Gilmore in our 1981 Annual Report. It’s amazing that those very words still apply today. But I imagine they will also be valid 30 years from now. The world is constantly changing, and businesses, individuals and governments need to change with it.
The world is recovering from a global recession. Some economies have come back pretty strong, like Asia. Things are looking up in South America, but we’ve still got an uphill climb. And Europe is really struggling.
We are all watching to see what happens around the world. But at Caterpillar, we don’t like to just watch, we feel an obligation to get involved. That’s why wherever we do business around the world, we actively promote many pro-growth policies. In terms of policy and governance there’s a lot we can do to be competitive. And many of the issues we are facing in the United States apply anywhere in the world that wants to compete in the global economy. Here are some things we feel strongly about:
1. Freer trade. Time and again, free trade is a proven winner for both sides. At Caterpillar, we promote freer trade wherever we can get it, but we also recognize that expanding global free trade agreements through the World Trade Organization is a once in a generation opportunity to open markets and increase worldwide economic growth.
2. Better infrastructure. Being able to participate in the global economy means being able to get your products out and get supplies and products in. That requires a robust, modern infrastructure. Many developing nations are investing heavily in infrastructure and it’s paying dividends. And many developed countries are in need of updated infrastructure to accommodate a growing population and changing needs. Yes, infrastructure is expensive and it’s hard to justify any spending when a country is struggling or in debt, but sound infrastructure is an investment that – when done right – will eventually pay for itself.

3. More energy. The world population is expanding and so is the middle class. Growing, modern economies need energy. This
is why we promote a broad energy portfolio. Alternative fuels and advanced technology offer some exciting possibilities, but
we also need to invest in tried and true resources like coal and natural gas. These fossil fuels can be very efficient, clean and sustainable, and companies like Caterpillar are hard at work to deliver sustainable solutions in terms of traditional resources and alternatives – we need both.
4. Lower corporate tax rates. The United States currently has one of the highest corporate tax rates, and it’s affecting investments. When you look around the world, those countries with lower corporate tax structures have a distinct advantage when attracting investment.
5. Improved education system. We talked about how policies and governments need to change with the times, and the same is true for our education system. Today’s jobs are high-tech. We need scientists, engineers, mathematicians, but we also need more people going into the skilled trades. These aren’t the jobs they were before. They are high-tech, skilled, safe jobs that can provide a good living. It’s true all over the world.
Quite a list, right? We’ve got work to do here in the United States, and around the world. These aren’t easy issues and there are no quick fixes, but there is a proven path for success – partnerships between the public and private sectors and individuals. At Caterpillar, we make our positions known. We educate our employees, our communities and government officials. If we don’t tell our side of the story, who will? If we don’t look out for the best interests of our company, our employees, our communities and our customers, who will? It’s up to all of us to become educated, to get involved and to work together – that includes the private sector, the public sector and individuals.
Will 2012 be the new normal? Probably not. We will be focused on growth and investment in our products, our processes and our people. These are all investments that pay dividends well into the future.
So what is the new normal? The new standard will be a flexible, agile Caterpillar that is squarely focused on our customers and on what the world needs. Our opportunities are limitless – we just have to go after them.
