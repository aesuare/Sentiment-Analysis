                Fellow Shareholders
I’m pleased to provide a review of ConAgra Foods’ FY15 performance,
and share my perspective on our company’s future. This is my first annual report letter to shareholders at ConAgra Foods, having joined our company as CEO in April of 2015. I’m excited to be here, and I’m eager to move forward with remaking ConAgra Foods into a much stronger company focused on meaningful value creation for the long term.
For several months now, I’ve been in deep study on our businesses, our capabilities and our culture. I’ve affirmed what I expected coming in, that ConAgra Foods has an opportunity to create real value for shareholders – if we are willing to embrace bold change. I will come back to this point at the end of this letter.
Before getting into the review of the year, I want to thank Gary Rodkin, who was ConAgra Foods’ CEO from 2005 until his retirement late in FY15. Gary ensured a seamless transition to me, and I’m grateful for his work dedicated to the company’s future success.
In FY15, ConAgra Foods was focused on business stabilization, profit recovery, dept repayment and cost savings. We:
• Achievedcomparableearningspershareof$2.18.1
• Generatednearly$1.5billionincashflowsfromoperations.
• Repaidapproximately$1.1billionofdebt,resultingincumulativedebt
reduction of approximately $2.1 billion since the completion of the
Ralcorp transaction, which exceeded the $2 billion goal.
• Realizedover$375millionincostsavingsfromstrongproductivity
and continued SG&A effectiveness and efficiency initiatives.
• Maintainedourannualdividendrateof$1pershare,consistentwith
our commitment to paying a top-tier dividend.
Our Consumer Foods segment focused on building a stronger foundation, with focus and discipline. Our portfolio of consumer brands delivered four consecutive quarters of operating profit growth in FY15, along with steady progress on the top line, strong performance in select retail channels and share gains in key categories. Highlights included:
• Extendingourleadershipinfrozensingle-servemeals,drivenbyongoing sales and share growth from Marie Callender’s single-serve meals.
• Drivingstrongsalesandprofitgrowthinfaster-growingretailchannels, including club, dollar and convenience stores, through retailer-specific focus and innovation.
• Gaining share leadership in the combined refrigerated and frozen whipped topping category, driven by smart investment in our Reddi-wip business.
• Makingprogressstabilizingkeybrandsbygettingthefundamentalsright through improved packaging graphics and effective promotion strategies.
• AddingBlake’sAllNaturalFoodstoourexistingfrozenmealsbusiness, providing greater opportunity for sales to a growing group of people buying natural and organic foods.
Within our Commercial Foods segment, our Lamb Weston frozen potato products business delivered a solid performance despite a lengthy labor dispute in the West Coast shipping industry, which disrupted our exports. ConAgra Foodservice, also within our Commercial Foods segment and a leading supplier to the foodservice industry, drove consistent growth in FY15, reflecting positive mix and execution with key customers. Other highlights included:
• Delivering volume and net sales improvement in Lamb Weston’s foodservice, U.S. chain and retail business units. This domestic growth offset a slowdown in international growth, which we see as temporary.
• Expanding our Boardman, Ore., potato processing plant to continue to accelerate innovation and support future growth for our global customer base.
• Opening our first potato processing plant in Shangdu, China, expanding Lamb Weston’s operations in a market that has growing demand for frozen potato products.
• BenefitingfromthefirstyearofoperationsforArdentMills,thejoint venture formed at the beginning of FY15. Ardent Mills is off to a strong start and we expect it to provide good accretion over the long term.
In our Private Brands segment, we established a new operating model and an aggressive turnaround plan to improve performance. In June 2015,
we announced our intent to divest this business, as we’ve determined it has the opportunity to be more successful, faster, as a focused private brands company. In turn, this provides ConAgra Foods with unwavering concentration on our best opportunities for growth and value creation within our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods segments. Until
the divestiture is complete, our Private Brands business will build on improvement work started in FY15, setting this business on a new path for long-term success.
All in all, while FY15 was a year of steady progress, more change is required to fulfill our potential. We need to take bold steps to transform ConAgra Foods into a higher-margin, more contemporary and higher- performing company for the long term.
Accordingly, we are now mobilized against our four-part base plan we outlined at the beginning of FY16. The base plan reflects a pragmatic and flexible dedication to value creation. Specifically, we aim to:
• DivestourPrivateBrandsbusinesstoenableinvestmentofour resources on other priorities within our Consumer Foods and Commercial Foods businesses.
• Accelerate our margin improvement through a more aggressive, intensive approach to cost-reduction, along with continued progress in Supply Chain and trade productivity.
• GrowourConsumerFoodsandCommercialFoodsbusinesses through portfolio segmentation and capability improvements, to create more value and drive sustainable growth.
• Createlong-termsustainablevalueforshareholdersbyhavingan investment-grade balance sheet and a balanced capital allocation strategy, including a commitment to a top-tier dividend and opportunistic share repurchases.
You’ll hear more throughout the year on these four areas. For now, know
that I’m committed to driving change, and importantly, embracing the right change to generate sustainable results for our shareholders. While we believe our plans can materially improve our performance, we will always remain open to any actionable pathway that maximizes value for our shareholders.
You have my commitment to keep you updated throughout each fiscal year. I appreciate your continued support and belief in ConAgra Foods.
Sincerely,
Sean M. Connolly
President and Chief Executive Officer
