Letter from the Chairman of the Board

Dear Fellow Shareholders,
With markets across the globe moving from traditional to electronic forms of payment, this is a very exciting time for MasterCard. We are in an extraordinary position to
deliver value to stakeholders around the world: to the financial institutions that offer our products and services, consumers and businesses who use them, merchants who accept them and regional economies that enjoy the rise in economic activity. Importantly, I believe our success in 2006 demonstrated our commitment to deliver value to you, our shareholders. As a new publicly traded company, one of our highest priorities was to build a strong, independent board of directors. As a member of the selection committee, I know, firsthand, the high level of rigour and consideration that went into the search process, which we completed in early 2007. I believe we've assembled a team with admirable depth and breadth of experience, as well as valuable geographical diversity that extends from the Americas to Asia and Europe. As a board, we're firmly committed to working with management to drive shareholder value through sound, transparent corporate governance practices and solid counsel as the company pursues its vision of advancing commerce globally. It is clear to me that MasterCard is well positioned to capitalise on the many emerging opportunities in the world of payments. No competitor has the combination of a corporate strategy focused on the needs of customers, a unified global structure, world-renowned brands, innovative payment solutions, an advanced processing platform and MasterCard Advisors, a professional services organisation solely dedicated to the payments industry. I believe we are effectively leveraging all of these assets for our constituents -- and that shows in our impressive results.

Letter from the President and Chief Executive Officer

Dear Fellow Shareholders,
For MasterCard, 2006 was no ordinary year. Through the talent and dedication of our 4,600 employees around the world, we delivered exceptional financial results and transformed our company into a publicly traded enterprise, committed to increasing shareholder value. This transformation took years of hard work, and I thank our employees for their extraordinary accomplishments. Today, with our corporate strategy and unique business model as a franchisor, processor and advisor, we are firmly positioned to deliver value to each of our constituents.
More than ever, our business depends on the strength of the relationships we foster. We are a critical link among tens of thousands of financial institutions, millions of businesses and hundreds of millions of cardholders. What's more, we are a driving force in revolutionizing the way the world does business, advancing commerce through innovations that benefit everyone, everywhere. To customer financial institutions, MasterCard is an essential engine of growth, expanding the use of electronic payments, providing an unsurpassed technology network, leveraging powerful global brands and delivering efficiencies through a unified global structure. To merchants, we're a business partner offering valuable co-branding opportunities and commerce intelligence that drive incremental revenue while providing a connection to hundreds of millions of cardholders who live around the world. To consumers, we're a convenient way to pay for everything that matters, offering brands that say "yes" in any language at over 25 million locations -- not to mention hundreds of thousands more online. Indeed, we are now so much a part of everyday life and business, it's easy to take our role for granted. Yet without our products and services, I believe that much of modern commerce would be affected. By advancing new and better ways to pay and building a global web of economic connections, we have positioned ourselves at The Heart of CommerceTM . A Year of Exceptional Results In 2006, we met or exceeded the expectations we had set for ourselves. Revenue for the year grew by 13.2%, from $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion. We also generated net income of $457 million1 for 1 the year, or $3.371 per share, compared with $317 million, or $2.351 per share, a year ago. MasterCard generated worldwide gross dollar volume (GDV) of almost $2 trillion, up 14.9% in local currency terms over 2005. It is worth noting that this level is double the GDV we reported just five years ago. Also in 2006, worldwide purchase volume rose 16.9% in local currency terms, to $1.4 trillion, driven by increased cardholder spending on a growing number of our cards. At the end of 2006, our financial institution customers had issued 817 million MasterCard® cards, an increase of 12.3% over the cards issued in 2005. Transactions processed across the MasterCard network increased 17.5% to 16.1 billion transactions. In addition to these results, 2006 was a year of accomplishment on many strategic fronts. Chief among these was the completion of our initial public offering -- the largest listing in the United States during 2006 -- and the election of what I believe to be an exceptional board of directors. I thank the members of our former board who had the vision and the fortitude to lead us through the company's transformation, and for whose support and courage we are all grateful. I also welcome the members of our new board, who offer a collective wealth of business know-how, strategic insight and global experience. In particular, I am pleased to welcome Rick Haythornthwaite as our new chairman. His deep knowledge of international markets and his strong leadership skills will surely prove valuable as we execute our strategy around the world.

Accomplishments and Initiatives The year 2006 saw many significant accomplishments and initiatives, such as the launch of our new corporate positioning. The name MasterCard Worldwide embraces what MasterCard represents, from our world-renowned brands and advanced network, to our unified global structure and our talented, multinational workforce. Importantly, the name underscores our commitment to meeting the unique needs of customers worldwide. To that end, we substantially advanced our strategy by deepening relationships with target customers around the world. Throughout the year, we shared industry insights, delivered custom-tailored solutions and provided innovative payments options, such as MasterCard PayPass® contactless technology and the World Elite MasterCard.TM We will continue to demonstrate the value we bring by leveraging our assets to the advantage of our customers. In 2006, we also continued to build upon major upgrades to our core technologies, enabling our customers to connect to a single, unified network with unsurpassed speed, flexibility and scale. Through our leading-edge technology and applications, our customers have the ability to expand operations worldwide, deliver customized value to partners and cardholders, and introduce breakthrough technologies without making major changes to their own infrastructures. We also strengthened ties with major merchants and launched a number of significant co-branding programs. To give merchants a stronger voice on strategic business initiatives that can benefit them and their customers, we held Merchant Advisory Group meetings in Australia, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States. In addition, MasterCard endeavored to meet a key merchant demand to bring greater transparency to the way we conduct business. Thus in 2006, we became the first payments company to announce that we would publish our interchange rates that apply to merchants in the United States, along with comprehensive information that merchants need to better understand these rates. At the same time, we continued to address mutually critical security issues. We co-hosted Payment Card Industry Security Forums in Australia, Japan and New Zealand; piloted advanced counterfeit card detection systems with retailer Best Denki in Singapore; and advanced MasterCard SecureCode® as a superior e-commerce security solution for customers and online merchants. We also hosted four Global Risk Management Symposia, bringing together bank and security experts from around the world. Meanwhile, financial institutions in Europe continue to accommodate the requirements of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) initiative. In 2006, we established SEPA fall-back interchange rates for Maestro® that are necessary for a competitive, transparent payment system across the euro zone. We believe that Maestro is firmly positioned as the solution that will best enable a smooth transition from national-use-only debit payment schemes to global and pan-European solutions.

Letter from the President and Chief Executive Officer

On the legal and regulatory front, we proactively dealt with numerous challenges. Though challenges of this nature will undoubtedly continue to affect the payments industry, we believe that as a publicly traded company, we are in a better position to address them. Importantly, we will continue to remind the public of the vital role we play in advancing commerce around the world. Our list of accomplishments would not be complete without noting our success in attracting new talent, developing leaders and fostering diversity and inclusion within our ranks. These areas continue to be company-wide priorities. Also notable were our efforts to support communities where we and our customers operate. One of these initiatives was the formation of The MasterCard Foundation, whose twofold goal is to build entrepreneurship through microfinance programs in developing countries and to prepare young people for success in a global workforce. I thank our financial institution shareholders and former board of directors for their support in creating this independent foundation. I believe it demonstrates both a substantial and meaningful commitment to economic development. Creating Value across the Board In many ways and in many places, our innovations and our connections are making us more valuable to everyone, on every side of every transaction. For every rushed commuter in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, who boards the bus using a TaiwanMoney card powered by MasterCard PayPass, there is a transit hub with shorter lines and a financial institution with a new stream of revenue. For every financial institution in Europe that converts its debit program to Maestro, there are consumers with more freedom to shop wherever they please, and storeowners benefiting from a boost in sales. For every retailer in Asia or Latin America who applies our powerful marketplace insights, there is a financial institution that sees increased card usage, and a cardholder who gains another Priceless® experience. In short, MasterCard is at the center of it all, advancing commerce and making it more secure for everyone. That is largely why, when the investment community looks at our business, they see what we see: a company firing on all cylinders, driving commerce on a global basis and leading innovation in the payments industry. In 2007, we will continue to advance commerce globally, helping our customers grow profitable businesses, forging stronger ties with merchants, offering consumers more convenient ways to pay and utilizing our strengths every way we can. After all, with 40 years of innovation and insight behind us, no company is in a better position than MasterCard to lead the way.
