TO OUR SHAREOWNERS:
It was a successful year for our company, our customers, and our shareowners as FedEx increased revenues and earnings to record levels. We also expanded our portfolio of services through the strategic acquisition of Kinko’s, and we developed new opportunities for sustained, profitable growth.
For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2004, FedEx reported record revenue of $24.7 billion, up 10 percent over the previous year. Net income grew to $838 million, and diluted earnings per share rose to $2.76. At the same time, we continued to focus on margins, cash flow and return on investment while exerting the discipline to reduce capital spending to $1.3 billion.
These financial results allowed us to raise our quarterly divi- dend from $0.05 to $0.07 per share and deliver a total return to our shareowners of 15.4 percent during FY04. FedEx shares have more than doubled in value during the last four years.
While we are proud of our financial performance in FY04, we are more excited by the prospects for the future. Among the reasons for our optimism is a trend that is not only redefining business, it is redefining the world – the increasing desire for access to products from every corner of the globe.
Harnessing the “power of possibility”
The world has changed significantly in my lifetime, giving rise to a new generation of individuals who believe they can have the goods, services, and information they want and need any- time, anywhere, and any way they want. Our society today is not defined so much by age or geography or culture, but by the belief that almost anything is possible.
At FedEx, we understand these expectations because we helped create them. Our networks provide unprecedented access to the modern world.
As a parent, I see this “power of possibility” through the eyes of my children. As a business executive, I see how it is transform- ing our customers. Through either lens, it’s clear to me that this access generation will continue to set the agenda for today’s global economy, seeking even greater access to everything they need and desire without regard to time or place.
FedEx is in a great position to meet such expectations, creating opportunities across all our business lines.
Expanding access to accelerate growth
To exploit those opportunities, FedEx is working hard to increase access for our customers as we expand our services and networks.
The Kinko’s acquisition opens customer access to a new suite of business services. In February, we completed the acquisi- tion of Kinko’s, and before the end of May the rebranded FedEx Kinko’s Office and Print Centers began offering full-service FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipping at virtually all U.S. locations. This fast business integration is designed to capi- talize on what we see as a perfect alignment of companies. In addition to providing more convenient retail access for FedEx shipping services, FedEx Kinko’s will also help us strengthen relationships with small businesses. In turn, FedEx will leverage its relationships with large corporate customers to help FedEx Kinko’s expand its fastest-growing business line – commercial document solutions.
     FedEx Corporation provides strategic leadership and consolidated financial reporting for the FedEx family of companies, managing a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services.

Expanded service areas improve access to the global market- place. Capitalizing on continued strong international shipping demand, FedEx Express added new air routes in Asia and began serving two new countries – Iraq and Kazakhstan – to bring the total number of countries FedEx serves to 215. As the premier all-cargo carrier serving China, we announced plans for a new FedEx Express headquarters in Shanghai and we expanded the number of cities available to our customers. We also opened key international markets for other FedEx companies. For example, FedEx Custom Critical launched overnight service into Mexico. FedEx Kinko’s opened its first location there last November.
Enhanced service in existing markets gives customers greater choice and reliability. In our core North American markets for FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground, we focused not just on get- ting bigger, but also on becoming faster and more reliable to help our customers streamline complex supply chains. FedEx Freight became the first carrier in the less-than-truckload freight industry to offer a no-fee money-back guarantee – a seal of approval, if you will, of FedEx reliability and competitive differentiation in that segment. We continued our planned $1.8 billion network expansion at FedEx Ground, and over the past two years we have accelerated service delivery commitments by one day in about 40 percent of our ground traffic lanes.
Advanced technology improves customer access to critical business information. Fedex.com continues to be one of the best and fastest sites in the business world, and we are con- stantly improving our online tools to support our goal of han- dling as many transactions as possible via electronic means. Customers increasingly rely on FedEx InSight to provide criti- cal information about inbound shipments to help manage their businesses more efficiently. With extensive online billing infor- mation, our customers can also manage their FedEx account
right from the desktop. For customers who have moved beyond the desktop, we continue to provide FedEx tracking information via wireless devices. And FedEx Kinko’s recently completed the rollout of T-Mobile Wi-Fi access in almost all U.S. locations.
Our commitment to a safe and sustainable environment con- tinues. Across the FedEx family of companies, we pushed for increased energy efficiency in our vehicles and our opera- tions. FedEx Express launched its first hybrid-engine delivery vehicle, which will decrease particulate emissions by 90 per- cent and travel 50 percent farther on a gallon of fuel. We plan to phase in the vehicles in select cities during the coming year. For the third year in a row, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Energy have also recognized FedEx Kinko’s for its leadership in renewable energy purchases.
Operating efficiencies fuel earnings momentum
While we capitalized on growth opportunities by increasing access for our customers, we also took decisive internal action to increase efficiency and profitability – all part of our continued commitment to increasing shareowner value.
The largest single initiative was our business realignment at FedEx Express, a voluntary workforce reduction to help “right- size” our network and position us for sustained, profitable growth. It was a difficult but necessary action that helped bring costs more in line with FedEx Express revenues. On a personal note, I would like to extend my thanks to all those who elected one of the early retirement or voluntary sever- ance offers – including many who helped build FedEx from the very early days of our company.
LETTER TO SHAREOWNERS
                        FedEx Express provides time-definite shipping to 215 countries, including every street address in the United States, delivering small packages and freight usually in one to three business days.
FedEx Ground provides cost-effective, day-definite shipping, specializing in small-package business-to-business delivery with convenient U.S. residential service through FedEx Home Delivery.

In the future, we will continue to examine cost reduction opportunities yet still invest wisely in our fastest-growing net- works. In FY05, we expect capital spending to rise modestly, funding additional aircraft capacity for the growing FedEx Express international business and investing in FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Kinko’s. We believe that prudent investment will allow us to generate strong growth in earnings per share and cash flow for the coming fiscal year as we benefit from our growing businesses and the full-year savings from our business realignment.
Shaping the new global marketplace
We believe the need and desire for access will only continue to grow. And we intend to be where FedEx has been for the past three decades – on the leading edge of global trends that shape the way all of us live and work.
• We will continue to press for free and fair trade in order to increase global economic access and raise the standards of living in developing countries, lifting millions of people out of poverty.
• We will continue to push for a safe and sustainable environ- ment, applying new technologies to help decrease the energy required to generate economic activity.
• We will continue to be at the forefront of safety and security measures as the worldwide community works together to meet global challenges.
Our commitment to access starts with our great FedEx people and extends to our valued customers and shareowners. It reaches across borders and time zones to shape the new global marketplace.
More than 240,000 FedEx team members around the world, in all FedEx operating companies, are committed to our Purple Promise and the unwavering commitment to a great customer experience with every transaction.
No one championed this commitment more than Sheridan Garrison, a retired member of the FedEx Board of Directors and chairman emeritus of FedEx Freight East. We were greatly saddened by Sheridan’s untimely death in 2004, and he will be missed by his colleagues, family and friends.
Among several recent board changes, we were pleased to add an outstanding new director, Ken Glass, who serves as chairman, president and CEO of First Horizon National Corporation, and valued board member George Mitchell announced his decision to retire. We thank him for his dedication and contributions to our success.
Guided by a strong board – and a leadership team that is sec- ond to none – I believe that FedEx is in great shape to meet the access demands for generations to come as we continue to perform for our shareowners.
Sincerely,
Frederick W. Smith
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
