ANNUAL REPORT 2013

DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
In today's global business environment, our specialized distribution model continues to deliver the value we promise. Our global presence, technical expertise and Supply Chain Solutions help our customers reduce the risk, cost and complexity of their supply chains. Our ability to scale our model and leverage our existing infrastructure globally enables us to take on new opportunities around the world, creating a platform for sustainable and profitable growth. Fiscal 2013 was another year of progress for us. A cautious capital spending environment and ongoing political uncertainty constrained growth in North America; however, we benefited from our geographic diversity as our European businesses stabilized and our emerging market regions recovered as the year progressed. Even though we anticipated improved capital spending trends by our customers in the second half of the year, the acceleration was both delayed and more modest than we expected, resulting in flat sales for the year. However, by focusing on operational levers that drive revenues, profitability, capital efficiency and cash flow, we delivered solid financial results. In spite of an environment of uneven growth around the globe, our business model proved resilient. We are pleased to share our highlights of 2013.

2013 HIGHLIGHTS

Our OEM Supply segment returned to profitable growth through accelerating sales, reduced operating expenses and improvements in inventory efficiency coupled with investments to advance our global growth.

We made substantial progress aligning our cost structure in Europe with our outlook for a prolonged period of slow growth in the region. Our efforts were rewarded as we exited the year with improved sales and margin trends across Europe.

Our Industrial Communication and Control initiative, the fastest-growing market in our Electrical and Electronic Wire & Cable segment, achieved global sales of $243 million in 2013, a 20 percent increase over 2012. With technology advances that enable connecting the factory floor to the network, we believe that industrial communication and control has significant growth potential for us in the future.

Our customers' supply chain needs are continually changing, and we are evolving our Supply Chain Solutions to support them. One recent example is our new READY!SM To Go offering, an end-to-end solution for our security integrator customers introduced in 2013. With one part number the purchase process is simplified, providing everything a customer needs, from cameras to storage, to deploy a complete video surveillance system. Our Supply Chain Solutions team continues to bring innovative offerings to our global customers and scalable opportunities to Anixter.

Emerging Markets Sales have grown by 66 percent over the last four years, with 2013 sales exceeding $830 million. Major opportunities exist in many large Latin American and Asian markets in all of our segments, driven by the same global trends of mobility, data creation and storage in our Enterprise Cabling & Security Solutions (ECS) segment; global oil, gas and petrochemical projects and infrastructure investments in our Electrical and Electronic Wire & Cable segment; and expanded manufacturing and supply chain outsourcing in our OEM Supply segment.

Our heightened efforts to improve working capital efficiency produced solid improvement in our accounts receivable and inventory management functions, enabling us to meaningfully lower the working capital deployed to run the business. Not only did our internal efforts pay off in improved financial results in 2013, but they also strengthened our company for the future by positioning us for more profitable growth as our markets improve.

 UTLOOK FOR 2014 AND STRATEGY O FOR SUSTAINABLE GROWTH
We remain focused on growth and are targeting niches that have similar profiles to our existing businesses: large and fragmented industries driven by long-term global trends such as data and technology growth, security concerns, energy production, infrastructure spending and outsourcing, where our specialized solutions bring high value to our customers. Three initiatives that we are targeting are Emerging Markets, Industrial Communication and Control and In-Building Wireless, all of which achieved strong growth in 2013.

Long-Term Organic Growth Rate

As we look to 2014, our view is that we will continue to see a gradual improvement in the global economy, which will support revenue growth in the mid-single digit range. Longer term, our goal is to grow our business at a 6-8 percent compound annual growth rate, before acquisitions, over an economic cycle. The building blocks of our organic

growth remain: share gains, expanded product offerings and continued expansion into global markets. In addition, while we remain selective about acquisitions based on our strategic, financial and risk profile requirements, we have a robust pipeline of targets along with the financial flexibility to pursue the right opportunities. Sincerely,

ANIXTER CARES
At Anixter, we believe it's important to support the communities where our employees live and where we conduct business. We also believe that supporting higher education now is essential for future generations. To encourage this support, we created the Anixter Cares program that allows employees three main ways to give and show they care including: · Matching gifts to the Red Cross · Matching gifts to higher education ·T  ime off to volunteer at a favorite non-profit charity. In addition to these three core initiatives, Anixter participated in a variety of other charitable causes in 2013 including the American Cancer Society, Step Out for Diabetes and Habitat for Humanity.

COMMITTED TO STEWARDSHIP OF CAPITAL
Finally, we recognize our role as a steward of our investors capital and benefit from the steady guidance of a knowledgeable, deeply committed and long-tenured board of directors. We also remain committed to open and transparent communication with the investment community. Consistent with this, we hosted our second Investor Day in August 2013 to further investors' understanding of our business and to provide them an opportunity to engage with the senior leadership team. We invite you to view several short videos, available on our investor relations website, anixter.com/investor, that were created as part of this effort. We believe our commitment to thoughtful and shareholder-friendly stewardship of capital is a compelling investment proposition. One of our financial differentiators is our long history of returning value to shareholders throughout an economic cycle. In fact, over the past 10 years, we have returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders, while over the past 20 years we have returned over $2 billion, or nearly 70 percent of our available cash, to shareholders. We would like to thank all of our stakeholders, including approximately 8,200 employees in over 50 countries, our customers and suppliers, our shareholders and our Board of Directors for your continued support. We look forward to sharing a very successful 2014 with all of you.
