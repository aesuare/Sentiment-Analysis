Dear Fellow Shareholders,

2010 was a transformational year for Charter.
With a stronger balance sheet, we sought new opportunities and faced new challenges. We generated healthy financial and operating results and executed meaningful steps in our strategy to enhance the customer experience.

Customers

We now serve more than 5 million customers in 25 states, providing highly valued subscription-based communications and entertainment products to residential and business consumers.

Today, we are a stronger company

In April, I became president and chief executive officer of Charter after having served as the Company's chief operating officer for five years. Over the course of the past year, we have recruited a strong leadership team focused on delivering the best products and service and on becoming the trusted advisor to our customers. We believe continued execution of our strategy positions us well for continued growth and innovation. Charter resumed trading on the NASDAQ in September 2010 under the symbol CHTR. This was an important and meaningful milestone for us, signaling the final step of our successful financial restructuring. Today, we are a stronger company with more financial flexibility, a track record of operational excellence, and a renewed commitment to delivering enhanced products and services that simplify and optimize the residential and business customer experience.

2010 Results

Charter continues to evolve to meet the growing needs of our residential and business customers, and I am pleased to report that we achieved significant progress during 2010. We increased revenues in high-speed Internet, phone, video, commercial products and advertising, while maintaining financial and operating discipline. On a pro forma basis, we generated $7.003 billion in revenue during 2010, an increase of 4.8 percent year over year. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.587 billion, an increase of 4.5 percent compared to 2009, and our pro forma adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.9 percent. On a pro forma basis, income from operations was $1.015 billion, while net loss attributable to shareholders was $230 million and net loss per common share was $2.03 for the year. We generated pro forma free cash flow, a key financial metric for our industry, of $704 million in 2010, an achievement in which we take great pride. We are also in a strong liquidity position with a solid BB- credit rating from Standard & Poor's. With lower leverage and the generation of free cash flow, we have had favorable access to capital markets. We maintain a disciplined, return-based approach for deploying free cash flow and have invested, and will continue to invest, in our business to drive profitable revenue growth and maximize shareholder value.

Delivering Quality Choice, Service and Value

Combined Video, Internet and Phone Customers

Charter has achieved these solid financial results while improving our customer offerings, maintaining a strong national footprint and continuing to make the infrastructure investments necessary to provide a basis for residential and commercial customer growth. We see significant upside in our video services and Internet penetration, along with opportunity for continued growth in phone through the Charter Bundle. The addressable market opportunity on the commercial side is approximately $8.5 billion, and we will aggressively seek out growth in this business in 2011 and beyond. As we look to become the solutions provider for both our residential and commercial customers, the foundation of our strategy is enhancing the customer experience ­ and to us, that means more than customer care and technical operations. It's also about making it easier for customers to use our services, maintaining network performance and reliability, and providing a winning value proposition. And we are committed to not only meeting but exceeding customer expectations.

We're making investments across our footprint to increase our speed advantage

We are a leader in Internet speed in our markets, and we're making investments in DOCSIS 3.0 across our footprint to further increase our speed. Early in 2011, we also set our strategy for the next generation of television into motion through an agreement with TiVo to bring an enhanced user entertainment experience to customers using a hybrid platform that leverages traditional cable and nextgeneration IP technologies.

This is just the beginning of what I believe are great things to come for our television and broadband customers. We believe we are in a unique position to act as the solutions provider to our customers, bringing meaningful new content choices and applications wherever and however they want. We'll also aggressively pursue increased growth in the small and mediumsized business, commercial and carrier markets. We've expanded our commercial service and product capabilities, and will continue to invest in the people, processes and systems to grow that business.
Well-Prepared for Future Growth

We have great momentum in 2011, and going forward, Charter will continue to remain focused on delivering value for you, our investors, by carefully managing operations, maintaining our targeted level of leverage, and striking the right balance in pursuing appropriate investment opportunities, both strategic and organic. New technologies and consumer trends will help shape the enhancement of our products and services, and we are committed to adding new product capabilities and features to improve the customer experience and generate growth.
