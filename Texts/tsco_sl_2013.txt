(L­R) Jim Wright, Greg Sandfort and Joe Scarlett at NASDAQ opening October 10, 2013.

To Our Stakeholders:
Tractor Supply Company is 75 years strong and growing.  Today, Tractor Supply is the largest retail farm and ranch store chain in the United States. We have made quite a journey since the Company was founded in 1938 as a specialty mail-order tractor parts business, opening our first retail store in 1940.  2013 represented another year of exceptional performance for Tractor Supply as we delivered record results by nearly every measure. STORE COUNT: The Company ended the year with 1,276 stores in 48 states and we continue to grow our square footage at a targeted pace of 8% annually. We consider this to be a very sustainable rate of growth as we progress toward our domestic target of 2,100 stores. REVENUE AND COMPARABLE STORE SALES: For the first time in our 75-year history, the Company exceeded $5 billion in annual revenue, growing sales by 10.7% to $5.16 billion. It was just 11 years ago, in 2002, when the Company surpassed $1 billion in annual sales. Comparable store sales for 2013 increased 4.8% on top of last year's increase of 5.3%. In the fourth quarter, we achieved our 17th consecutive quarter of positive comparable store sales. TRANSACTION COUNT: Our comparable store trans action count increased 4.7% in 2013 and in the fourth quarter we delivered our 23rd consecutive quarter of comparable transaction count increase. Our commitment to be the most  dependable supplier of basic maintenance needs to those living the rural lifestyle continues to drive increased traffic in our stores. OPERATING MARGIN: Operating margin improved to a record 10.0% in 2013. This represents a 400 basis point improvement since 2009. The Company continues with a balanced approach to driving earnings through increasing both sales and operating margin. EARNINGS PER SHARE: In 2013, the Company's earnings per share grew 22.1% to $2.32 per diluted share, representing our 4th consecutive year of earnings growth in excess of 22.0%. OTHER MILESTONES: The Company achieved many other milestones in 2013 as we entered three new states, opening our first stores in Arizona, Nevada and Wyoming. We now operate in 48 states and continue to expand our presence in the West. We successfully relocated to a new distribution center in Macon, Georgia, which houses our first direct import center. We also broke ground on our new Store Support Center that will consolidate all of our store support teams into one campus in Brentwood, Tennessee. We celebrated the Company's 75th year anniversary by ringing the NASDAQ opening bell in October. And, lastly, Tractor Supply was added to the NASDAQ 100 index in late December and to the S&P 500 Index in early 2014. STRATEGIC FOCUS: At Tractor Supply, our strategic focus remains on three key areas: Driving Growth, Creating Efficiencies, and Developing People.

2013 represented another year of exceptional performance for Tractor Supply  as we delivered record results by nearly every measure.

Making Memories, Building Loyalty

YEARS STRONG
On January 14, 1959, Tractor Supply Company goes public, listed on the over-the-counter market.

In 75 years, Tractor Supply Company has grown from a specialty mail-order tractor parts business founded by Charles E. Schmidt into a leading retailer with 1,276 stores in 48 states, and annual sales in excess of $5 billion and became a member of the S&P 500 Index. None of this would have been possible without: 1) the hard work and dedication of thousands of team members; 2) the strong loyal customer base which we serve; and 3) the vision and leadership of Charles Schmidt, Tom Hennesy, Joe Scarlett, Jim Wright and Greg Sandfort.

Driving Growth
Our long-term growth targets remain unchanged. We continue to look to increase annual earnings per share in the mid-teen percent range by: 1) growing our square footage around eight percent, 2) delivering positive c  omparable store sales growth in the three-to-five percent range and 3) improving operating margin by 25 basis points or more. We also remain committed to returning value to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs.  We are driving growth through a number of strategic initiatives, such as: leveraging our customer relationship  management tools to increase customer spending, retention, and new customer acquisition; testing and developing new, destination product categories; driving incremental gross profit; executing our competitive positioning strategy; and evolving our multi-channel commerce and social capabilities.

Creating Efficiencies
Tractor Supply is committed to being a lean organization. Through our Tractor Value System (TVS) processes, we take waste, cost and effort out of key processes to drive efficiencies.  Additionally, our Company is creating efficiencies through initiatives in a number of areas, including: systems and technology improvements, supply chain management, centralized purchasing, expense management, and environmental impact programs.

 As an organization, we are focused on offering the tools to enable our people to learn and grow. We embrace a culture that promotes from within the organization and provides unlimited opportunity for advancement.  The 19,000-plus team members throughout our stores, distribution centers and Store Support Center are all part  of the Tractor Supply family. I would like to thank all of our current and former team members and business partners who have helped to shape the Tractor Supply Company we know today.  We are grateful to serve a wonderful, and growing, customer base dedicated to living the rural lifestyle. These customers rewarded Tractor Supply with the opportunity to  meet their needs more than 116 million times in 2013. We are continuing to improve our ability to be their one stop shop for products to care for the home, land, pets and animals.  Tractor Supply has tremendous growth opportunities ahead as we move toward to our target of 2,100 domestic store locations. Our goal is to open more than 100 stores annually and to partner with the communities we serve, through creating jobs, taking care of our customer and supporting local community events.   I am delighted with the performance of our team in 2013. We are proud of our past and very excited about our future. While Tractor Supply is 75 years strong, we believe we are just getting started.

Developing People
At Tractor Supply, it has always been about taking care of the customer and developing our people. We believe in "doing the right thing," "respecting others," "working together as a team," "taking individual initiative," and "being accountable for our results." Our Company was founded on these values and they remain our Company's guiding principles today.
