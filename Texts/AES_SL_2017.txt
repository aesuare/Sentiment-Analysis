SHAREHOLDER DIVIDEND
2017 was another year of rapid change in our industry, with new technologies transforming the landscape, causing declining power prices in some of our markets, and creating new opportunities for investment in renewables, energy storage and natural gas across our global platform. We have taken actions to reduce our exposure to lower power prices, by exiting the majority of our merchant generation and pursuing long-term contracts for our future growth projects. Additionally, by executing on our strategy, we have positioned ourselves for future leadership in delivering clean, reliable and affordable energy solutions. We will continue to reshape our portfolio, strengthen our Balance Sheet, reduce our carbon intensity and utilize partners to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.
Here are some examples of our on-going strategic efforts:
• We are maximizing our efficiency with a new organizational structure, which will yield an additional $100 million in savings by 2019.
• We have accelerated our efforts to reduce Parent debt by $1 billion, or 20%, putting us on track to achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019, one year ahead of our prior plan.
• We are advancing on our 4.4 GW of construction projects, including a CCGT and LNG regasification and storage terminal in Panama that will diversify the country’s generation mix and promote natural gas throughout the region.
• Through a balanced approach, we have been reshaping our portfolio, while reducing our carbon exposure.
• We acquired 2.3 GW of renewable capacity and announced the exit of 4.3 GW of merchant coal-fired generation.
2017 RESULTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Turning to our specific results and accomplishments in 2017, we delivered on our financial guidance, continued to meet our commitments to our shareholders and achieved milestones in our strategy.
We earned Adjusted EPS of $1.08, toward the upper-end of our guidance range. Consolidated Free Cash Flow came in at $1,921 million, also at the upper end of our guidance range.
We accelerated the transformation of our portfolio by exiting 4.3 GW of merchant coal-fired generation. We also expanded our renewables portfolio and grew our world-leading battery-based energy storage business. During the year we acquired or advanced the development of more than 2.3 GW of renewable generation in the United States, Brazil and Mexico. In partnership with Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo), we acquired sPower, the largest independent solar developer in the United States, with 1.3 GW of solar and wind in operation and another 10 GW in development.
We believe the integration of renewables and energy storage is the key to accelerating a cleaner energy future. This is one of the most promising opportunities in our industry and our businesses are leading the way. For example, in Hawaii, we are delivering two solar plus storage facilities for a total

of 47 MW of solar capacity and 34 MW of five-hour duration battery-based energy storage on the island of Kauai. The first of these pioneering projects is under construction and will satisfy energy demand during peak hours in the evening, as well as the rest of the day.
Integrating energy storage to enhance the output of solar and wind facilities is a key focus area for Fluence, our new energy storage joint venture with Siemens. Global demand for energy storage is expected to grow ten-fold in five years, reaching at least 28 GW of installed capacity by 2022. We expect Fluence will deliver energy storage solutions and services to a broad group of customers, from commercial and industrial companies to utilities and power developers around the globe. Our goal is for Fluence to consolidate its position as the market leader in this high-growth segment.
Our on-going efforts to reduce the complexity of our portfolio resulted in the announced the sale of Masinloc in the Philippines, which we expect to close in the first half of 2018 and generate proceeds of $1 billion. We will use these proceeds to repay Parent debt, putting us on track to achieve investment grade metrics in 2019, one year ahead of our prior plan.
Finally, to help drive our future growth, we made progress on our 4.4 GW of capacity under construction, including the completion of 279 MW of new solar, natural gas and energy storage capacity in the United States and the Dominican Republic.
Our primary projects under construction include: the 1,384 MW Southland repowering (CCGT and four-hour duration energy storage) in Southern California; the 1,320 MW OPGC 2 coal-fired expansion in India; the 380 MW Colón CCGT and LNG regasification and storage facility in Panama; and the 671 MW Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana. These 4.4 GW of new capacity will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth through 2020.
Unfortunately, during 2017, our stock price did not reflect this positive progress and momentum, yielding a total return of -2.7% compared to the S&P 500 Index total return of 21.8% and the S&P Utilities Index total return of 12.1%. Part of our underperformance was driven by investor concerns about U.S. tax reform. We were not immune to the legislation and in fact, certain provisions are more adverse to AES due to U.S. taxation on our international earnings. Furthermore, our performance was also impacted by declining power prices in some of our markets, as well as some business-specific issues.
First, in September, our operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Following the hurricanes, AES provided critical assistance to its employees and local communities in Puerto Rico. Specifically, we delivered bottled water, cleared storm debris from roads and schools and provided critical diesel fuel for generators to the Salvation Army and Guayama Hospital. We did sustain modest damage at our 24 MW Ilumina solar plant and minor damage to our 524 MW coal-fired AES Puerto Rico plant, both located in Puerto Rico. Our teams were able to restore our facilities in Puerto Rico within a few weeks and have been available to meet the island’s energy needs since that time.
Second, while we achieved major milestones on our 4.4 GW construction program, we continued to face construction delays and cost overruns at 531 MW Alto Maipo hydro project in Chile. To overcome these challenges, Alto Maipo has reached an agreement for a lump sum fixed price contract. Once the project

lenders approve the revised construction contract, we expect Alto Maipo to be completed on time and on budget, providing a long-term source of reliable, clean and affordable electricity to the city of Santiago and the surrounding region.
Third, in Chile, we continued to see electricity prices under pressure from oversupply, weak demand and new renewable energy entrants. Over the longer-term, as demand in the mining sector picks up, we expect energy demand to increase, as well. Having said that, lower power prices have been weighing on AES Gener’s stock listed in Chile, despite the fact that AES Gener’s portfolio of assets has an average contract life of 10 years and AES Gener achieved record profits in 2017.
CREATING LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE
During 2017 we made further progress toward our long-term strategic goals. The actions we have taken since 2011, such as cutting our costs by $300 million, reducing Parent debt by $2 billion and generating $5.4 billion in asset sale proceeds, have provided us with the ability to maximize returns for our shareholders through disciplined capital allocation.
Reducing Complexity
We have been reshaping our portfolio by exiting certain businesses to reduce risk and re-deploying our excess cash into debt repayment, share repurchases, dividends and growth projects with long-term, U.S. Dollar-denominated contracts. Since 2011, we have announced or closed $5.4 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales, decreasing the total number of countries where we have operations from 28 to 15.
Leveraging Our Platforms for Long-Term Growth
We are focusing our growth on platform expansions in markets where we already operate, have a competitive advantage and are able to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns. Since 2011, we have brought on-line 5,333 MW of new projects, including 279 MW in 2017.
Including projects currently under construction and our recent acquisitions, we will be adding 8.3 GW of new capacity through 2020, increasing our total installed capacity by 25%.
These projects are helping us to significantly reshape our portfolio to deliver sustainable and attractive returns. At the same time, we are reducing our carbon intensity and deploying new energy solutions. By the end of 2020, we anticipate our coal generation will decline from 41% to 29%, while renewables and gas generation will increase from 55% to 68%.
Furthermore, we recently announced that based on the steps we have taken to-date, we expect to reduce our carbon intensity (tons of CO2/MWh of generation) by 25% from 2016 to 2020, resulting in 20 million tons of fewer carbon dioxide emissions. We are also establishing a longer-term target to reduce our carbon intensity by 50% from 2016 to 2030.
Allocating Capital in a Disciplined Manner
Our overarching goal is to deliver sustainable and attractive risk-adjusted total returns to our shareholders.
Since 2011, we have executed on our strategy and generated substantial cash, which we have deployed in line with our capital allocation framework:

• We returned $2,719 million to shareholders through share repurchases and a
quarterly dividend
• In 2017, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8.3%, to $0.13 per share
• We used $2,604 million to prepay and refinance Parent debt, including $341 million in 2017
• We invested $2,198 million in new projects and acquisitions, including $863 million in 2017
We remain committed to strengthening our credit, which is largely driven by the successful completion of our construction program, cost reductions and de-levering. Accordingly, we have accelerated our goal to achieve investment grade metrics by one year, to 2019, and now expect to attain investment grade ratings by 2020.
DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE RESULTS
As a leading sustainable power company, our diverse mix of generation sources provides us the strength and flexibility to adapt to local and regional market needs, maximize plant efficiency and deliver reliable, affordable electricity. Our businesses do much more than just provide power. Improving lives and making a lasting difference in the communities we serve has always been one of our values and part of our mission.
Our values are, and have been, at the heart of our operations. We always put safety first – for our people, contractors and communities. Safety comes before everything at AES. Learning from our experiences in a challenging 2016, we established six key actions to help us strengthen the safety of our workplaces. These actions led to positive safety results in 2017 with zero fatalities for AES people and a 35% decrease in Lost Time Incident (LTI) cases. In 2018, we’ll continue working towards creating and sustaining an incident free workplace.
In 2017, AES was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for North America for the fourth year in a row by RobecoSAM. We were also named by Ethisphere as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the fifth year in a row. These recognitions demonstrate the degree to which every member of the AES team lives by our values.
CONCLUSION
We have positioned AES to deliver attractive and sustainable risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. We will achieve this objective as we continue to optimize our costs, strengthen our Balance Sheet, reduce our carbon intensity and deploy new technologies in our existing markets. The Board of Directors and Management are committed to continuing to execute on our strategy and delivering on our 2018 guidance and 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020.
