To Our Shareholders,
During fiscal 2001, growth in the information technology services industry slowed for the first time in a decade. The consulting and systems integration markets were especially hard-hit. Demand for hardware and software eased. And, of course, the bubble burst for the dot-coms. These factors, compounded by unfavorable currency exchange rates and a slowing global economy, contributed significantly to the company's performance. CSC's revenues climbed to record levels but earnings declined for the first time in 15 years. Major new business wins continued at a robust pace. We achieved record revenues of $10.5 billion, an increase of 12.3 percent, approximately 16 percent in constant currency terms over last year -- a remarkable achievement given the current environment. Strength in our global commercial outsourcing business, our U.S. federal business and international businesses outside Europe accounted for this growth. Earnings for the year, excluding special items, were $389 million, compared with $433 million last year. The decline can largely be attributed to reduced demand for consulting and systems integration services worldwide and some isolated performance issues. We have taken appropriate actions to respond to market conditions and to address our performance including restructuring our consulting operations, reducing employee headcount in certain businesses and geographies, and combining redundant account and administrative functions. These actions resulted in a pre-tax special charge of $137.5 million. Including charges related to the global restructuring of our financial services activities as a result of our acquisition of Mynd Corporation, pre-tax special charges totaled $232.9 million. Fiscal 2001 is not a year we plan to repeat. The actions we are taking to capture more new business and ensure CSC's leadership position are expected to provide tangible results. CSC continues to win new business and establish relationships with strategic clients. Major new wins during the year nearly matched last year's record $11 billion. While we have won contracts of all sizes across our markets, we are emphasizing larger clients and doing larger projects of broader scope and longer duration. Here are a few representative examples:
·

Our acquisition in December of Mynd Corporation makes CSC the global leader in information technology-based insurance products and services. We can now deliver the full set of end-to-end solutions to insurers and other firms in the converging financial services industry. Mynd's strong position in managing business processes for clients is especially noteworthy. Business process outsourcing, or BPO, is expected by Gartner Group to grow at 23 percent per year for the next three years, making it one of the fastest-growing outsourcing segments. CSC now has over 10,000 people serving 1,200 financial services clients in more than 60 countries. In March, CSC acquired InfoSer SpA of Milan, Italy. InfoSer specializes in providing information technology services and products to the Italian banking market, and augments expertise CSC has in the insurance, telecommunications, public sector and fashion markets there. The acquisition brings to 1,400 the number of IT professionals CSC has in Italy. During fiscal 2001, CSC launched new services offerings in some of the fastest-growing sectors of our market. Our global hosting services met with market acceptance worldwide. We currently serve nearly 100 clients in six hosting centers on three continents. Drawing on our leadership in providing information security to the U.S. federal government, we launched in February a Global Information Security Services unit, the first of its kind in the global commercial market. More recently, we announced the launch of our Global Knowledge Management Services unit to provide the full range of KM services -- from consulting to implementation to operations -- to clients throughout the world. CSC continued to strengthen and expand relationships with existing clients worldwide including BAE SYSTEMS, AMP Limited, Raytheon Company and Sempra Energy. We have already significantly expanded our arrangements with Nortel Networks and Broken Hill Proprietary Limited. More recently, we announced major wins with BMW and Schroders, p.l.c. The long-term nature of our relationships with clients and the full breadth and depth of our capabilities position CSC for success even in periods of uncertainty. Our strategy leverages our strength in developing relationships. More than ever, we will focus on serving large, global clients with complex business and technology needs. CSC's ability to combine our diverse and far-reaching capabilities to deliver solutions that best meet the unique needs of these clients worldwide is now more valuable than ever. CSC is a solid company with exceptional prospects. We have a large pipeline of new business opportunities in both federal and commercial markets. More important, we have among the strongest relationships in our industry -- relationships with our clients, suppliers, alliance partners and with our employees. These relationships are built on value, on performance excellence, on trust. It is the power of these relationships that will continue to drive our success -- and our stakeholders'. Sincerely,

a seven-year, $1 billion contract from AT&T to manage application development and maintenance work for the company's consumer services organization a global information technology outsourcing agreement with Nortel Networks valued at $3 billion over seven years participation as a prime contractor in the U.S. Army Aviation and Missile Command support services program a $470 million, seven-year information technology outsourcing agreement with the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited of Australia a long-term agreement to provide complete information technology support to Saab AB's aerospace business, valued at $300 million.

These and the many other awards we won in fiscal 2001 are expected to fuel our revenue growth going forward. The company makes strategic acquisitions to obtain industry expertise and technology skills, provide new offerings and access new opportunities, and enter new geographies. In fiscal 2001, two acquisitions strengthened our capabilities in all these areas. June 15, 2001 Van B. Honeycutt Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
