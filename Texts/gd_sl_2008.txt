LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Fellow Shareholder, In 2008 your company booked record orders, sales, operating earnings and free cash flow. The strong order intake, which reached $57 billion, led to an unprecedented year-end backlog of over $74 billion. Continued top-line growth at each of our business groups resulted in $29.3 billion in sales in 2008, an 8 percent increase over 2007. Operating earnings grew at more than double the rate of sales, resulting in 19 percent growth in earnings from continuing operations and 22 percent growth in earnings per share. Operating leverage across the four business groups led to an impressive 110-basis-point improvement in combined operating margin. Three of our company's four business groups reported over $1 billion in operating earnings. Free cash flow, defined as net cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures, totaled $2.6 billion, which represents 106 percent of earnings from continuing operations. This superb result is consistent with the company's track record, having converted nearly 115 percent of our earnings from continuing operations into cash over the past five years.
Capital Deployment

Management took advantage of this strong free cash flow to invest in strengthening the market position of our businesses by completing five acquisitions for a total of $3.2 billion. We also deployed $1.5 billion to repurchase 20 million common shares, approximately 5 percent of our issued and outstanding shares. Shareholders received $533 million in dividend payments during 2008. Earlier this month, the Board increased the quarterly dividend for the 12th consecutive year to $0.38 per share, further improving what was already a very good yield. We repaid $670 million of debt in 2008 and issued $1 billion of five-year fixed-rate debt. The proceeds from this issuance provide financial flexibility in the current market environment. Our long-term debt ratings by Standard & Poor's and Moody's remain A/A2 while our short-term ratings remain A-1/P-1. We remain committed to a balanced capital deployment strategy. Our solid balance sheet and strong cash generation provide us the flexibility to continue to deploy capital where it generates the most value for our shareholders.
Report on Operations

From an operating perspective, 2008 was a year of significant achievement. Very few companies in the S&P 500 performed better than General Dynamics. Every one of the four business groups contributed to our strong performance. Let me briefly review each segment.

Aerospace

The Aerospace group generated $5.5 billion in sales in 2008, a 14 percent increase over 2007. Top-line growth was driven primarily by increased aircraft deliveries, improved aircraft pricing and growth in aircraft-services volume. Operating earnings topped $1 billion with operating margins of 18.5 percent, a 170-basis-point improvement from 2007. During most of the year, Gulfstream enjoyed strong demand for its long-range and ultra-long-range business jets, including its new G650 product. The 288 orders received in the year added $15 billion to the backlog which stood at $22.5 billion at year end. This year-end backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries for large-cabin models into the next decade at current production levels. The state of the economy, in general, and the turmoil in the besieged financial services industry, in particular, caused new-aircraft order activity to moderate late in 2008. Deteriorating economic conditions also caused some Gulfstream customers to default on their contracts in the fourth quarter. Further, we are experiencing additional perturbation in the backlog in the first quarter of 2009 along with continued weak demand. As a result, we adjusted production of large-body aircraft to 73 down from 87 last year. Mid-size aircraft production has been trimmed to 24 down from 69 last year. Nevertheless, our still very large backlog spread over a highly diverse customer base provides a solid foundation for the business in this tough market environment. Gulfstream's service-business revenues grew to over $700 million in 2008, reflecting the continued growth of the global installed fleet. In order to increase our exposure to this expanding fleet and to uphold a commitment to provide first-in-class service to our growing international customer base, we acquired Jet Aviation in November 2008. Jet Aviation's global footprint includes aircraft service centers in over 20 locations worldwide. This acquisition also provides premium aircraft-outfitting and refurbishment operations for a variety of business jets produced by other manufacturers as well as narrow- and wide-body commercial aircraft. Our product development efforts enjoyed success in 2008 with the introduction of the two newest additions to Gulfstream's fleet. We obtained nearly 200 orders for the ultra-large-cabin, ultra-longrange G650 that will fly for the first time in the second half of 2009. The new super-mid-size G250, which offers a breadth of new capabilities, has also drawn great customer interest. The G250 and G650 aircraft, which will enter service in 2011 and 2012 respectively, are just the beginning of an exciting product development future for Gulfstream.
Combat Systems

Combat Systems led the company in operating earnings in 2008. The group generated $1.1 billion in operating earnings on sales of $8.2 billion. Earnings growth significantly outpaced sales growth as a result of a nearly 200-basis-point improvement in operating margins. Disciplined execution on the manufacturing floor and our successful European integration efforts contributed significantly to this performance.

Sales and earnings growth were driven by continued demand for the group's combat vehicles, particularly M1 Abrams main battle tanks and Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles. While these programs were important drivers, each of the businesses contributed to the group's impressive performance. The Combat Systems backlog totaled $15 billion at year end, a 16 percent increase over 2007. This diverse backlog represents primarily production contracts for many of the group's mature vehicle programs, including the Stryker and Pandur wheeled combat vehicles, M1 Abrams and Leopard tanks and Pizarro advanced infantry fighting vehicles. The group's backlog is matched by a wealth of promising opportunities in its core markets including hundreds of tanks and light armored vehicles for delivery to Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2012 and several opportunities to equip Iraq's armed forces. Adjacent markets, such as the recent MRAP opportunity, the new MRAP All-Terrain Vehicle (M-ATV) and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle also offer potential future upside. I expect that the group's future workload will be further bolstered by critical reset work to revitalize and reconstitute U.S. weaponry depleted in Iraq. In 2008, the group moved further into a merchant supplier role through the acquisition of AxleTech International, a global manufacturer of highly engineered drive train components and aftermarket parts. The group's new business opportunities, robust backlog and continued focus on execution position it for continued growth and success.
Marine Systems

General Dynamics' shipyards were extremely productive in 2008. The group's delivery of two Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, two Virginia-class submarines, two T-AKE combat-logistics ships and the near-completion of the first commercial product carrier combined to drive 11 percent sales growth. Notably, the group's solid execution on these core programs generated nearly 24 percent operating earnings growth, more than double the rate of sales growth for the year. Operating earnings of $521 million on revenue of $5.6 billion resulted in 9.4 percent operating margins, 100 basis points of hard-earned improvement over the 2007 result. The group's backlog doubled in 2008 to $26.4 billion. Orders received in 2008 included $1.4 billion for three T-AKE ships, $1.4 billion for the first DDG-1000 and $13.8 billion for eight Virginia-class submarines. The submarine contract, which covers deliveries through 2019, doubles production to two submarines per year beginning in 2011. This incremental volume will spur growth in the group's revenues and earnings over the next three years. The group's significant order intake during 2008, the resulting backlog and the continued strength of execution across our shipyards position Marine Systems to lead the company in sales and earnings growth over the next several years.

Information Systems and Technology

Information Systems and Technology revenues exceeded $10 billion this year, a 4.3 percent increase over 2007. Operating earnings once again topped $1 billion. Notably, earnings grew in tandem with sales, enabling the group to maintain industry-leading 10.7 percent operating margins, while absorbing the continued growth of the lower-margin service component of the group's portfolio. The group's tactical communications business maintained its momentum in 2008, turning out another year of double-digit sales growth and surpassing several key program milestones. These pivotal achievements included passing a series of operational and developmental tests on the nextgeneration battlefield communications network program, Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T), and the Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS). The group's federal and civilian IT support business also enjoyed double-digit growth, positioning the group well in markets with strong future growth potential. Strong order intake in 2008 led to a $10 billion year-end backlog, a 7 percent increase over 2007, and an impressive book-to-bill ratio of 1.12 for the year. This strong order intake highlights the competitive strength of the group's products and services. Reported backlog does not include another $10 billion of potential contract value associated with indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) awards. In 2008, task orders on IDIQ contracts contributed more than 30 percent of the group's order intake. Together, backlog and potential contract value grew 11.8 percent to $20.5 billion. In 2008, we acquired two companies that provide niche capabilities in the fast-growing tactical communications and healthcare information technology arenas. Since the group's inception, we have enhanced its core capabilities and diversified its customer base through the acquisition of almost 30 companies. I believe this underlying stable of highly specialized and capable businesses positions the group to benefit from a wide array of future market opportunities.
Market Environment

General Dynamics' core defense programs are well-supported in the fiscal year 2009 defense budget. This budget includes $182 billion in spending on the development and procurement of weaponry, including full funding for our core product programs. The Congress has also already approved $66 billion in 2009 supplemental funding to support the nation's efforts in the Global War on Terror. The Defense Department has requested an additional $76 billion of supplemental funding this year, including additional funding for systems we produce. The new administration is working on its fiscal year 2010 budget submission. In light of the continued uncertainty in the global security environment, the projected growth of U.S. military forces, the buildup of troops in Afghanistan and the need to reset and modernize the military's equipment, I expect the company's core programs to continue to be well-supported by both the Department of Defense and the Congress.

The final months of 2008 ushered in significant change, including the election of a new administration and the sudden dislocation of global capital markets. The new administration will soon place its imprimatur on the strategic direction of the Department of Defense. While change is inevitable, the company's backlog, operational execution, agility and deep understanding of customer requirements position us well in the period ahead. The manufacturing of our defense systems provides an important stimulus for the U.S. economy at the same time our products and services provide security to the United States, its friends and allies. Over the next two years, the extraordinary dislocation in the global economy will curtail the growth enjoyed by our aerospace business over the last five years. However, improvements to the group's business model made subsequent to the last cyclical downturn, a durable backlog and a disciplined manufacturing organization enable the aerospace business to fight its way through this downturn. The pipeline of next-generation aircraft position the group for continued growth in the 2011-2012 timeframe. I believe General Dynamics is poised to enjoy continued success during this uncertain period. In my opinion, opportunities in our defense business offer attractive upside to the risk implicit in the aerospace business.
