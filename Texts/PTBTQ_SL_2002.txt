 		POPE & TALBOT, INC.

Michael Flannery Chairman, President and CEO

To Our Shareholders:


With 2002 closed, Pope & Talbot is managing through one of the most difficult periods our industry and the Company have faced in recent history. The global economic downturn has severely affected our pulp business. In the fourth quarter, list prices for northern bleached softwood kraft pulp began to decline after  a brief upturn in the second and third quarters, pushing prices again to historically low levels.
Additionally, the lumber trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada has significantly affected our lumber business and the lumber market as a whole.  In 2002, Pope & Talbot paid lumber duties at a combined rate of 27.2 percent, or $14.1 million.  These payments began on May 22, 2002 when the U.S.  government made final duty determinations.
For the year, Pope & Talbot reported a net loss of $21.0 million, or $1.34 per share, compared  to a net  loss of $24.9 million, or $1.68 per share in 2001. During these challenging economic times, we were able to maintain our focus on production, logistics and overhead cost reductions. Pulp costs of production and raw materials in 2002 were reduced  by $43 per ton from 2001 levels and the average cost per metric ton of production decreased seven percent. Over the same time period, Wood Products costs of production  and raw materials were reduced by $19 per thousand board feet and average cost per thousand board feet of lumber, excluding the impact of lumber import duties, decreased three percent. Additionally, since the Mackenzie acquisition, we have exceeded our first year synergy target of $10 million in cost savings.
These cost reductions, combined with an intense focus on working capital management and reduced capital spending of $17.3 million in 2002, resulted in our net debt level increasing by only $9.2 million over the past year to $228.4 million. In July, we completed a $60 million debenture offering that has enhanced our liquidity position significantly. Today, the majority of the Company's debt is long-term, due in 2007 and 2013. As of January 1, 2003, we had available $38.7 million of borrowing capacity under our lines of credit. Shareholders' equity was $143.9 million at year end 2002, resulting in a net debt ratio of 61 percent.
While we hold the belief that dividends are an important aspect of the Company's policy of providing returns to shareholders, the erosion in shareholders' equity during the recent economic downturn and the continued uncertainty of the health of the global economy have led the Company's Board of Directors to reduce the quarterly dividend by approximately half to $.08 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2003.
Announced pulp price increases in the first quarter have led to a more optimistic start in 2003. Pope & Talbot's improvements in manufacturing and raw material costs combined with an upswing in pulp prices bode well for improved results. I want to thank our shareholders, customers and employees for their continued support and dedication during these trying times. I am confident that we can look forward to a bright future.
