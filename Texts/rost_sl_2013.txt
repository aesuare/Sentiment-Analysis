 To Our Stockholders
Our top priority at both Ross Dress for Less and dd’s DISCOUNTS is always offering great bargains to our customers. This unwavering focus on delivering compelling values enabled us to deliver another year of record sales and earnings in fiscal 2013.
Solid Sales and EPS Growth in Fiscal 2013 on Top of Exceptional Multi-Year Gains
For the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2014, sales grew to $10.2 billion, up from $9.7 billion for the 53 weeks ended February 2, 2013. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended February 1, 2014 grew 3% on top of a 6% gain in fiscal 2012.
Net earnings for the 52-week year in 2013 grew to a record $837.3 million, up from $786.8 million for the 53-week year in 2012. Earnings per share for fiscal 2013 were $3.88, up from $3.53 in 2012. The Company’s fiscal 2012 results included a per share benefit of approximately $.10 from the 53rd week. On a 52 vs. 52-week comparison, 2013 earnings per share rose 13% on top of robust gains of 20% and 24% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.
In addition, we were able to maintain fiscal 2013 operating margin at a record 13.1%, despite the estimated 20 basis point benefit from the 53rd week in 2012. Profit margins for 2013 benefited from higher-than-planned merchandise gross margin offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales.
Ongoing Store Growth and Expansion into New Markets
As planned, the Company opened 77 net new locations in 2013, consisting of 55 Ross Dress for Less and 22 dd’s DISCOUNTS. We ended the year with a combined 1,276 stores in 33 states, the District of Columbia and Guam.
Our store growth during the year included ongoing expansion in the new markets Ross Dress for Less entered beginning in October 2011. By the end of 2013, we operated a total of 64 Ross locations in Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky and Indiana. In addition, dd’s DISCOUNTS entered New Mexico and South Carolina in 2013.

  For 2014, we plan to open about 85 net new locations, including approximately 65 Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. We continue to believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow into a chain of at least 2,000 locations across the United States and that dd’s DISCOUNTS can eventually expand to about 500 stores. Combined, this reflects a long-term domestic potential of about 2,500 locations, which is almost double our existing store base.
Continued Growth in Sales and Profits at
dd’s DISCOUNTS
dd’s DISCOUNTS delivered another year of solid gains in sales and operating profits in 2013. Similar to Ross, dd’s DISCOUNTS continued to benefit from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to our stores while operating on lower inventory levels. Its improved performance also reflects that dd’s value-focused merchandise assortments continue to be well received by its customers.

Healthy Cash Flows Fund Growth and
Ongoing Stock Repurchases
Operating cash flows in 2013 provided the necessary resources to fund new store growth and infrastructure improvements. We invested approximately $550 million of capital during the year, including approximately $180 million to open new locations and update existing stores and about $370 million mainly for distribution infrastructure and information technology projects, including the relocation of our data center and our move into new corporate headquarters. We ended 2013 with $435 million in cash and short-term investments and $150 million in long-term debt.

 For fiscal 2014, capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately $800 million to fund new store openings over the next year, as well as infrastructure investments we are making to support our long-term expansion plans. We are in the process of constructing two new distribution centers and also expect to complete the purchase of our New York Buying Office building in 2014. This purchase is a unique, one-time opportunity that will enable us to continue to house all our New York merchants together, which maximizes the cohesiveness and effectiveness of this critical organization. Operating cash flows are projected to self-fund all of our planned investments, except for our New York Buying Office, which we intend to finance.
During 2013, we also repurchased $550 million of our common stock, or about 8.2 million shares, under the two year $1.1 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors at the beginning of the year. We expect to complete that ongoing program in 2014. In addition, in February 2014, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 18% on top of a 21% increase in January 2013 to $.20 per share.
The growth of our stock repurchase and dividend programs has been driven by the significant amounts of cash our business generates after self-funding store expansion and other capital needs. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993, and have also raised our quarterly cash dividend annually since 1994. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns.
Flexible Business Model Enhances
Long-Term Profitability
We are pleased with our record level of sales and profitability in 2013. Looking ahead, in order to operate successfully in today’s continued uncertain macro-economic and retail landscape, we will continue to focus on the execution of our proven off-price strategies that have historically enabled us to perform well in a variety of business environments.
To maximize our ability to deliver great bargains every day to our customers, we will continue to invest in our merchandise organization, which remains our top priority. Experience shows that this is the key to increasing our access to the best name brand merchandise in the marketplace.
In addition, to enhance both sales and profitability, we will continue to strictly control both expenses and inventories.
Our ongoing focus on fine-tuning our merchandising systems and processes to plan and allocate at a much more detailed level also remains more important than ever today. This is especially true as we continue to grow in new markets and operate our stores with lean inventory levels.
We also continue to implement numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies throughout the business. These initiatives are driving down costs in our distribution centers, stores organization and back office functions.

  Looking ahead, we are excited and optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. We believe that off-price will remain a strong-performing sector of the retail industry for the foreseeable future. We know that our ability to consistently deliver great bargains every day will always be the key to enhancing our opportunities for growth in both sales and profits over the short and long term.
Social Responsibility at Ross
The six Ross Dress for Less stores we opened in Northern California in 1982 have grown into the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,146 locations at the end of 2013; dd’s DISCOUNTS, which we launched in 2004, had 130 stores at year end. Our success over the past 31 years has been driven by an unwavering commitment to creating value, with a focus on excellence, ethics and integrity in all we do.
This extends far beyond our mission of offering customers great name brand bargains. It also means enhancing the lives of more than 66,000 associates by providing a work environment where they can grow and succeed. Further, we continue to support the communities where we operate through local hiring and philanthropic efforts, including a new foundation we established in 2013 that will support our charitable mission to help create a brighter future for today’s youth. In addition, we continually look for ways to strengthen operating efficiencies while minimizing our impact on the environment.
In closing, we extend our sincere appreciation to all of our customers, business partners and stockholders for their continued support. We especially want to thank our valued associates throughout the Company whose continued commitment and hard work will always be the most important drivers of our ongoing success.
