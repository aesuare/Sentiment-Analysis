 To our ShareholDerS, employeeS, anD FrienDS
return to profitable growtH
Last year, we reported that we had taken quick
and decisive actions in a tough economy during 2008 and 2009. Our goal was to strengthen the company during the challenging global recession. History has proven that the greatest opportunity for share shift and value creation occurs when there
is a discontinuity in the marketplace. With this in mind, we launched new growth initiatives, increased investment in our organization, added talent to our team, initiated new training and development programs, and opened new locations. Our operating mantra was to “play offense” and
I am pleased to report that our investments and growth oriented posture are beginning to pay off and produce results.
We delivered profitable growth in 2010 and achieved a return of 95% for our shareholders. Execution of our growth strategy is underway, and resulted in increasing momentum across our global business. After declining 3% in the first quarter, sales grew 9% in the second quarter, 15% in the third quarter, and 18% in the fourth quarter, resulting in full year sales growth of 10%. The strength, diversity and operating leverage of our business model are clear, and are reflected in the improving profit quality of our business, where operating margins improved from 3.3% in the
first quarter to 4.5% in the fourth quarter. We strengthened our capital structure and generated strong free cash flow at 97% of net income while restarting our acquisition program. We entered 2011 a stronger, more capable, and more competi- tive company with positive business momentum.
global supply cHain solutions company
Our vision is to be a global leader of supply
chain solutions, a company that is known for
the best customer service and the best people. The operative words in this vision statement are “global” and “supply chain solutions”. We are much more than just an electrical or industrial distributor. We are a complete supply chain company, focused on providing customers with the leading products, services and solutions they need to meet their MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operating), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), and Capital Project requirements. We serve over 100,000 customers, including an impressive array of blue chip Fortune 1000 companies across a wide range of Industrial, Construction, Utility, and CIG (Commercial, Institutional, and Government) end markets. We ship over one million different products every year by partnering with over 17,000 suppliers. For a number of our supplier partners, we are their largest customer and channel to market. The breadth and depth of our capabilities, geographic footprint, and supply base enable us to meet our customers’ needs and provide continuity to their operations. Over the last decade, we have expanded and strengthened our portfolio by diversifying our end markets, customer base, service capabilities, product lines and supplier relationships, and will continue to do so as we move forward through the next decade.

value creation – toDay anD tomorrow
The opportunity for value creation is directly proportional to the fragmentation of the market- place. Our addressable wholesale distribution markets are very large and highly fragmented,
and include thousands of local competitors and suppliers. These markets offer many degrees of freedom for strong companies to get even stronger and gain market share. Overall market trends
of increased supply chain consolidation and outsourcing are accelerating as we move through the recovery phase of this economic cycle. Customers are looking to do business with a smaller number of larger, more capable and financially stable supply chain partners. Suppliers are looking to do business with a smaller number of larger channel partners, who have financial staying power and can create demand for their products and services. We are well positioned in the middle of this value chain and are capitalizing on these increasing market trends.
Our financial objectives have been consistent
and are focused on shareholder value
creation. Since the buyout of our company from Westinghouse in 1994, we’ve built a Fortune 500 enterprise with market leadership positions, a balanced portfolio of businesses, and a high performance continuous improvement culture. Today, we see even greater opportunities for future value creation. As we stated at our August 2010 Investor Day, our objectives are to deliver 20% to 25% annual net income growth, provide superior return on invested capital, and generate strong free cash flow through the cycle, as we execute our strategy of above market organic growth
plus accretive acquisitions.
growtH strategy being executeD
Over the past year, we took the opportunity to refresh our growth strategy to reflect the new global economic reality that exists. We confirmed our outstanding value creation opportunity and established a long term strategic growth framework built around a strong operating core. We have two growth pillars that sit on top of a foundation of operational excellence. The first growth pillar is “expand”, which includes expanding in our core end markets, expanding geographically in North America and around the world, and expanding with customers by selling our complete portfolio of products and services. Our second growth pillar is
“enrich”, which includes enriching our franchise by adding new products and supplier relationships, and extending our business models into new markets. These growth pillars are enabled by driving operational excellence in our key enterprise wide processes and functions of Marketing,
Sales, Service, Sourcing and Talent Management, along with a consistent application of LEAN and One WESCO.
We established our growth agenda and priorities by identifying the business opportunities offering the greatest potential for profitable growth over the next three to five years, which are illustrated on the front cover and are as follows:
• Global accounts and integrated supply programs
• Data and broadband communications and security
• Governmental agencies
• Electric utilities and utility contractors
• Engineering, procurement and construction firms and construction contractors
• Lighting systems and technologies related to sustainability
• Wire and cable solutions • International expansion
We are continuing to invest in these eight
growth engines by adding resources, developing additional initiatives, and prioritizing execution across our business enterprise. This is translating into increasing business momentum and above market results.
We restarted our acquisition program last year, adding TVC Communications and Potelcom to the WESCO family, and most recently RECO in March 2011. We have a strong balance sheet, a robust pipeline of acquisition opportunities, an increased global presence, and a higher growth product mix with over a $1 billion run rate in data and broadband communication products, up from less than $100 million five years ago. The significant operating leverage and effective cash conversion inherent in our business model provides us with excellent future value creation potential.

 operational excellence founDation – lean anD one wesco
LEAN continues to be a real competitive differentiator. Since 2003, we have been applying LEAN initiatives across our entire business enterprise, from front end sales and marketing,
to back end product delivery, customer service and support. Over the last few years, we have been extending LEAN to our customers to help them improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and supply chains. We have conducted over 5000 kaizen events to date and consider LEAN to be a never ending quest for perfection. We are in year seven of our continuous improvement journey and see more opportunities today than
the day we started.
One WESCO is our initiative to work effectively across all boundaries and operate as a fully integrated operating company. For customers,
it emphasizes the full range of products, services and solutions that we provide for their demanding applications. For suppliers, it emphasizes the sales gains that can be made by partnering with WESCO. For employees, it emphasizes the personal and professional benefits of working together as one high performance team with all efforts focused on satisfying customers. Fundamentally, One WESCO is all about integrating our multi-company heritage and capabilities into one operating company, where the whole is greater than the sum of our parts.
people are our Differentiator
In business, culture matters, culture differentiates, and culture endures. It is our people that determine our high performance and continuous improvement culture. We are a people business and talent management is all about attracting, developing and retaining the best and brightest. We have a seasoned management team of skilled leaders, who behave like owner-operators. We have a highly committed and diverse workforce that displays “extra effort” in serving customers and in finding a better way every day. We are increasing the investment in our talent base, ramping up our college recruiting efforts, and expanding WESCO University. Overall, we are placing increased emphasis on employee development and training as we strive to be recognized as the employer of choice in the industries we serve. Our people
will be our sustainable competitive advantage over the long term.
