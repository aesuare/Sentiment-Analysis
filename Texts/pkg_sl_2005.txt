2005proved to be a difficult and challenging
year before closing on a rather positive note.
Industry corrugated products shipments were down 0.8% for the first three quarters of the year before rebounding strongly in the fourth quarter with shipments up 5.0%. For the full year, industry shipments were up 0.6%, compared to an increase of 3.2% in 2004. Despite containerboard inventories remaining at lower than historic levels, industry publications reported container- board price reductions of $55 per ton over the spring and summer months. These price reductions coupled with all-time high costs for both energy and transportation reduced profitability for PCA and the industry.
On the positive side, industry demand and pricing began to improve during the fourth quarter, and containerboard capacity reductions totaling about 1.5 million tons were announced in 2005 by various producers. Even more noteworthy, industry containerboard inventories plunged during the second half of the year and ended December at 2.265 million tons, the lowest year-end inventory level since 1994.
With both natural gas and oil reaching record price levels during the year, PCAÕs fuel flexibility provided significant cost advantages that allowed us to distinguish ourselves among industry competitors. Natural gas, for example, rose in price from about $6 per million BTUs at the beginning of the year and reached a high of over $15 per million BTUs during the fourth quarter. As shown
in the chart, PCAÕs use of natural gas has been reduced dramatically over time, falling to an all-time low consumption level of only 2.3% of purchased fuels in December 2005. This would compare to much higher consumption by all of our major competitors.
PCAÕs purchased fuel mix in our mills, which is comprised of about 80% coal and bark and together cost about
$2 per million BTUs in 2005, puts us in a rather unique and advantageous position within our industry. So, while higher oil and natural gas costs did reduce our profitability in 2005, it did so to a much smaller extent than for virtually all of our competitors.
PCAÕs net income for 2005 was $53 million, or $0.49 per share, compared to $69 million, or $0.64 per share, in 2004. Net income for 2005 included income of $7 million, or $0.06 per share, from a dividend paid to PCA by Southern Timber Venture (STV), a timberland joint venture in which PCA holds a 311Ú3% ownership interest, and also included an after-tax charge of
$1.6 million for the shutdown of a corrugated products plant and other severance charges. Net income for 2004 included income of $17 million, or $0.16 per share, from a dividend paid by STV.
Excluding these special items, adjusted net income for 2005 was $47 million, or $0.44 per share, compared to $52 million, or $0.48 per share, in 2004. Full year sales were $2.0 billion, compared to $1.9 billion in 2004. Higher transportation cost was the biggest single factor that contributed to reduced earnings. Year over year, transportation costs were up $21 million pre-tax, or about $0.12 per share. As a comparison, energy costs, for the reasons noted earlier, were up only $9 million pre-tax,
or $0.05 per share.
Cash generated during 2005 totaled $266 million, which included $243 million from operations and $23 million from other sources, primarily STV dividends. Cash uses were $125 million for capital expenditures, $97 million for common stock dividends and $49 million for acquisi- tions. These uses totaled $271 million. An additional
 
                                         $93 million of cash was used in December 2005 for common stock repurchases, and PCA ended the year with $113 million cash-on-hand and $695 million of long-term debt.
PCA continued to make considerable progress in building a strong and growing customer base, even in the face of less than robust industry demand for most of the year. Our corrugated products volume was up 4.6% in 2005 (3.4% excluding acquisitions) compared to industry volume which was up only 0.6% per workday. This
marks the eighth consecutive year that PCAÕs volume has outperformed the industry and reinforces our belief that we are easy to do business with, while at the same time providing the best value. In fact, since 1997, PCAÕs corrugated products volume is up 32% (29% excluding acquisitions), compared to essentially flat growth for the industry.
shares and acquire and retire 4.5 million shares at what we consider an attractive price. And weÕre pleased that Madison Dearborn has still retained a sizeable investment in PCA and representation on our Board
of Directors, as we hold them in high regard both as investors and advisors.
On January 19, 2005, PCA increased its quarterly dividend to an annual rate of $1.00 per share. At PCAÕs end-of-year closing price of $22.95 per share, this dividend represented a yield of 4.36% which is the largest in the industry, and reflects our belief that dividends are an effective and important vehicle to return value to our shareholders.
As we enter 2006, business fundamentals for the containerboard and corrugated products industry appear quite encouraging. Demand picked up, especially in the fourth quarter of 2005, and at year-end, containerboard inventories were at their lowest levels in 11 years. Pricing has also begun to improve. Trade publications reported price increases for containerboard of $30 per ton in October 2005 and $40 per ton in January 2006 along with related price increases for corrugated products.
In addition, these publications reported that most major producers have announced a $50 per ton increase for containerboard effective in March/April 2006.
Our biggest challenge entering 2006 will be to maintain adequate containerboard inventories in our box plants in order to support corrugated products growth. Transportation related cost pressures and difficulties will most likely continue and will be further exacerbated as we operate at low inventory levels. We will, however, continue to work to find ways to minimize the impact of these costs and difficulties.
Our strategy will continue to revolve around the concept of operational excellence. We are specialists in container- board and corrugated products with 97% of our sales
in that segment, compared to much lower percentages for our major competitors. Our success depends on continuing to improve our capabilities and expertise
in every operational aspect of our business. To that extent, we feel that we have the people, the operating philosophy and the resources to capitalize on improved business conditions as well as utilize our strategic and financial flexibility to create and return value to our shareholders.

PCA also made significant progress on several key strategic objectives. First, we completed important projects on our paper machines at the Counce and Valdosta mills that now give us the capability to run lightweight linerboard grades on every machine in our system. This capability is especially important and timely considering the tight containerboard market conditions that prevail today.
Second, we continued to expand our corrugated products business and increase the integration level between
our mills and our box plants with the acquisition of Midland Container in April 2005. This acquisition filled
a geographical void in our system by adding two plants in Mississippi and a plant in Missouri. It also improved our integration level by over 1% while providing us with additional value-added graphics capabilities.
Finally, in December we successfully completed a secondary offering of 17.8 million shares of PCA common stock that was owned by PCA Holdings LLC, an entity controlled by Madison Dearborn Partners. At the same time, we repurchased directly from Madison Dearborn 4.5 million shares of PCA stock at the net secondary offering price of $20.69 per share. These actions allowed us to increase our public market float by 17.8 million
