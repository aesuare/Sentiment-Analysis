Dear Fellow Shareholders: I am pleased to report that LifePoint Hospitals has met its goals, which again exceeded the expectations of the investment community. Our strong financial performance is highlighted elsewhere in this annual report, so this year's shareholder letter will be a bit different. I want to use this once-a-year opportunity to talk directly to our shareholders about the fundamental strengths and values of our business, which drive our strong operating and financial performance. Healthy Communities, Healthy Hospitals The hospital, like a school, is a focal point in communities all across America. It is a point of hometown pride -- a place where people feel a sense of ownership even if the community no longer owns the facility. They recognize it as one of the community's most important resources, not merely as a business. They support it, as a provider for their mutual needs and as a symbol of their community's viability. The local hospital is a connecting point, a place of shared experiences. For many, it is where their children, and perhaps their children's children, were born. It is where people come together as volunteers. Those who provide care and those who seek it may know each other well. Often, their children attend school or play on sports teams together. A community's hospital is the point where lives begin and are sustained. It is Kenneth C. Donahey Chairman & a point of strength that helps nurture both the physical and economic health of the Chief Executive Officer area. Often, it is one of the community's largest employers. And it is a point of entry, through which new physicians, other healthcare professionals and their families enrich the community with their diverse energies and experiences. Finding Opportunities Where Some See Only Challenges Hospitals in non-urban environments have faced some difficult challenges in recent years -- challenges that, in many communities, have threatened their very futures. Medicine, for example, increasingly has come to rely on advanced technologies, particularly in the realm of diagnostics. This equipment, in turn, is rapidly superseded by new generations of even more sophisticated technology. Many smaller hospitals find themselves struggling financially to keep up with their larger urban counterparts when it comes to offering the latest, most advanced medical equipment. Similarly, many non-urban hospitals have found it difficult to expand their facilities, upgrade or replace aging physical plants, open new outpatient centers and provide new services. They often lack the resources that would help them recruit new physicians to practice in communities that may be many miles from a major metropolitan area. Meanwhile, many have faced pressure from managed care organizations not only to contain costs but to deliver more care for less. In such an environment where it has become more difficult to compete, it is not surprising that many non-urban hospitals have witnessed an outmigration of patients to large, tertiary-care facilities. And even when community hospitals have been able to expand their patient services and invest in state-of-the-art technologies, they often struggle to overcome a perception among area residents that larger urban hospitals necessarily deliver superior care. In 27 communities from Wyoming to Florida, LifePoint Hospitals has become a point of difference -- not simply by quantitative measures but in the quality of life. In all but one of these towns, ours is the only hospital: a singular point of pride, point of contact and point of caring. We pursue excellence in ways that both fulfill the needs of our neighbors and serve the interests of our shareholders. We take the same hometown pride in strengthening the hospital that our neighbors there have always felt. We bring the same commitment that caring for neighbors is not simply a business opportunity, but a strengthening of a civic bond. After all, these are our hometowns, too.

Every hometown and hospital, of course, is different. One strategy does not fit all. At the heart of our efforts in each locale, however, is one common set of values. Above all, we seek to deliver high-quality, cost-effective care for patients and their families. We seek to ensure that our hospitals will remain a strong resource that delivers value for the whole community. We seek to provide equally powerful resources for physicians, whose knowledge and skill form the hospital's core strength. For our employees, we seek to foster excellent working environments that encourage their personal and professional growth. And, at all times, we will ensure fiscal responsibility to all those who have a stake in our hospitals: our patients, our physicians, our employees, our communities, and our shareholders. Experience has taught us that cost control and quality care need not be adversaries. In rural markets, where some see significant challenges, we have found compelling opportunities. In adhering to our core values, we have helped build healthier hospitals, healthier communities and a reputation for excellence. A Good Place to Be While our hospitals are a vital part of the communities they serve, there is one notable difference between LifePoint and many of our neighbors in those communities. They grew up there. We are present by choice. It is a strategic decision, we believe, that has been validated with each succeeding year of our company's existence. As a leader in the non-urban marketplace, we have only just begun to achieve our true potential. Non-urban hospitals today offer particular opportunities for providers positioned to make the most of them. While many of these hospitals have struggled on their own to compete, they also offer an attractive environment for a company, such as LifePoint, with the resources and experience to build upon their solid foundations. For one thing, non-urban markets provide even more favorable demographics for healthcare than the nation as a whole. The populations in the markets where we operate are growing at a rate that is higher than the national average. While inpatient admissions across the country are projected to increase significantly, analysts say they will grow fastest in the South and West, where we own a number of hospitals. The competitive environment is even more favorable. The non-urban setting and relatively small populations of the communities we serve translate into less competition. In all but one of our 27 marketplaces, we operate the community's sole hospital. At the same time, we benefit from a strong degree of community loyalty. Local residents are more likely to "stay at home" for their care if possible; provided their hometown facility offers services, technologies and quality of care comparable to larger facilities miles away. In addition, managed care penetration is generally lower for non-urban markets than for hospitals in larger cities, where pressures on reimbursement have been most severe. Finally, this sector offers excellent potential for growth. More than 40% of all hospitals in the United States are situated in rural markets. Of these, investor-owned companies such as LifePoint own less than 10%; government entities and not-for-profit organizations own approximately 92% of America's community hospitals. With the continuing pressures to offer new services, attract new physicians, deal with increasingly complex regulations and halt patient outflows from their communities -- all while facing shortages of capital -- more and more of these facilities are looking to outside ownership for the resources that will enable them to continue carrying out their mission of service. Those resources -- reinforced by a commitment from LifePoint that mirrors their own -- are precisely what we offer. For 28 hospitals (and counting), we provide a critical point of difference. A Point of Access If it is true, as the old adage holds, that all politics is local, it is even more true of healthcare -- and most true of all for healthcare in smaller towns, where patients and providers know each other and where the local hospital is not simply a dispenser of services but a community institution. For that reason, we do not seek to strengthen hospitals simply by linking them to a network in which they may serve as interchangeable parts. We

develop strategies around the needs -- and strengths -- of each community and each hospital. While the mix of specific strategies will differ with each locality, they share many general elements in common since many hospitals face similar challenges. In each community, we have worked to expand key services that enable area residents to enjoy more convenient access to outstanding care. In some hospitals, that may mean building a new, state-of-the-art emergency room or a women's health unit with patient-friendly birthing suites. In others, it may mean expanding surgical capacity or developing a new ambulatory surgical center. It may mean investing in highly sophisticated new diagnostic imaging equipment; or renovating areas within the facility; or adding new services, such as rehabilitation or cardiology, that had not been offered before locally; or some combination of all of the above. Since 1998, we have invested more than $222 million to expand services and facilities. That investment has been worthwhile. Improving access to specialty services allows our neighbors to receive excellent care without leaving their hometowns. It strengthens cash flows for the hospital. In the process, it also helps strengthen the overall community. A Point of Entry Physicians are a hospital's lifeblood. Recruiting new medical staff not only is key to the facility's quality of care, but enriches the community's quality of life through new families and their energies. While practicing away from large cities and large hospitals is not appealing to everyone, there are many highly qualified physicians who are attracted to the lifestyle that smaller communities offer. Finding and recruiting these practitioners -- particularly in certain specialties -- requires skills that many smaller hospitals simply do not possess and sophisticated medical equipment they often cannot afford. LifePoint fills these critical gaps. Since 1998, we have recruited more than 330 physicians to our hospitals. These doctors, in turn, have enabled the hospitals to expand the availability of their services, compete more effectively, and keep more patients and revenues within the community. Points of Accountability Improving the cost-effectiveness of care is a goal of every hospital. Each LifePoint hospital benefits from our continuing focus on cost control and margin improvement -- and our team's managerial expertise in reaching goals in these areas. Through such efforts, we have achieved higher productivity, lower supply costs, reduced labor expenses, increases in collected revenue and fewer write-offs to bad debt. Meanwhile, we have been able, through facility-specific contract agreements, to obtain more favorable terms from managed care payors that have resulted in increased revenues to our hospitals. As our company continues to grow, both from within and through selective acquisitions, we expect to increase our negotiating leverage even further. A Point to Build Upon In addition to fostering growth within the markets we serve, we have also pursued a strategy of selectively acquiring other non-urban hospitals that meet our criteria. We seek facilities that are sole or significant providers within their areas and enjoy strong community support. Then, we look for a solid base of physicians on which to build: a favorable payor mix and good potential to increase revenues and improve margins. For example, in 2000 we acquired 141-bed acute care Putnam Community Medical Center in Palatka, Florida, for approximately $49 million; prior to our acquisition, the hospital had annual revenues of $49 million. In 2001, we purchased 118-bed Athens Regional for $20 million; prior to our acquisition, the hospital had annual revenues of $24 million. In late 2001, we acquired 116-bed acute care Ville Platte Medical Center in Louisiana for a purchase price of approximately $14 million; prior to our acquisition, the hospital had annual revenues of $22 million.

Following these criteria, LifePoint added five hospitals to its growing family in 2002. In October, we completed the acquisition of Russellville Hospital, a 100-bed acute-care facility in Russellville, Alabama. Also in October of 2002, we purchased the remaining ownership, resulting in our being the sole owner, of the entity that owns Western Plains Regional Hospital, a 110-bed facility in Dodge City, Kansas. In addition, in December 2002, we purchased four additional hospitals: 132-bed Logan General Hospital (now known as Logan Regional Medical Center) and its affiliated entity, Guyan Valley Hospital, a critical access hospital, both located in Logan, West Virginia; 99-bed Burdick-West Medical Center in Haleyville, Alabama; and 71-bed Northwest Medical Center in Winfield, Alabama. A Point of Strength Through a wide array of quantitative measures, our approach has strengthened the hospitals in the communities we serve. Recruiting new physicians and investing in new services, technologies and facilities have helped produce significant increases in patient volumes. On a same hospital basis, total surgeries rose from 76,274 to 81,463 in 2002 -- an increase of 6.8%. Outpatient surgeries grew by 7.2%, while visits to our emergency rooms, continuing a strong upward trend, grew by 2.3%. As a result, same hospital revenues rose by 10.5% in 2002. Meanwhile, improved expense management has helped our hospitals realize a decrease in labor costs and bad debt as a percentage of revenues, while our purchasing programs have held supply costs stable. Quantitative measures, of course, are not the only indicators of success. By strengthening hospitals, we also are strengthening entire communities. We are building up institutions that anchor people to their hometowns and keep them vital. In a very real way, we are helping both to preserve a small-town way of life, while improving the quality of those lives. Meanwhile, LifePoint's experience has shown that serving the needs of communities and serving the interests of shareholders can represent an alignment of incentives. This merger of interests has enabled our company to grow increasingly stronger. In the future, we intend to build on these strengths. Through disciplined growth, continuous improvements and prudent investment, we believe we are better positioned than ever to continue adding value, not just for our shareholders, but for the people we call neighbors and the places we call home.

Sincerely,

Kenneth C. Donahey Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
