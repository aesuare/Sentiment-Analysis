 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
2005 was another great year for NVR. We recorded the most profitable year in the Company’s history, the fourteenth consecutive year of improved operating income, and the largest ever volume of new orders and settlements.
Consolidated revenues for 2005 were $5.3 billion, up 22% over 2004 revenues of $4.3 billion. Net income increased 33% from 2004 to $698 million in 2005, another NVR record. Earnings per diluted share increased 35% to $89.61, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of 43% over the past five years.
New orders for 2005 totaled 14,653 units, an 11% increase over the 13,231 units reported for 2004. Relative to 2004, the number of homes in backlog at the end of 2005 rose 13% to 8,310 units, while the dollar value of the backlog increased 26% to $3.7 billion, its highest level ever.
We believe it is crucial to our continued success to be a dominant builder in each of the markets in which we operate. Therefore, our growth strategy involves increasing market share in our current markets and expanding into contiguous markets where
we can leverage our existing relationships. This has proven to be a successful strategy for us, and we intend to follow it while remaining opportunistic as it relates to new market expansion.
NVR’s consistently strong financial performance is the result of remaining faithful to a business strategy that emphasizes liquidity. Our business model is designed to efficiently use our capital resources while minimizing risk. We are not in the land development business. As an alternative, we purchase finished lots from reliable local developers in areas where we believe high levels of absorption can be achieved. We sell homes that target core consumer segments rather than niche markets and we
rarely engage in speculative building. As a result, NVR enjoys industry-leading results in inventory turnover, return on equity, and return on capital. The liquidity afforded by this business model is deployed to grow earnings per share through expanding existing operations, funding acquisitions should a unique opportunity arise, and repurchasing shares of our common stock. This business model has been a cornerstone of our success.
For the eighth consecutive year, NVR was selected as one of Forbes Magazine’s “Platinum 400” companies, which ranks companies that possess, in their words, “high rankings for corporate practices as well as long- and short-term sales and earnings growth and stock market performance.” NVR was one of only 44 companies to be recognized on the Platinum Honor Roll for being named to the Forbes Platinum List for each year since its inception. In April 2005, Fortune Magazine also recognized NVR

 for its outstanding performance by ranking it first as the best investment over the past five and ten year periods compared to all Fortune 500 companies. We are extremely proud of this recognition and know that it would be impossible without the excellent performance of our dedicated employees, subcontractors, developers, and suppliers, and we thank them for their continued service.
The homebuilding sector experienced another record-breaking year in 2005 even as the market slowed late in the year. While we expect these more challenging market conditions to continue in 2006, we believe that our conservative approach and financial strength will position us to compete favorably and maintain our industry leading performance.
Sincerely,
