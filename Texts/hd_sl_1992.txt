MESSAGE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS

 

" Blee d ing Orange!"
That's an expression heard around our Com­ pany every day, from our store breakrooms to our corporate boardroom. Our customers
praise us for our low prices, excellent product assortment and dedicated customer service.
Management experts laud our leading-edge information systems and financial acumen. But the primary key to our success is our 39,000 em ployees who wear those orange aprons you see in our stores.
Few great achievements - in business or in any aspect of life - are reached and sus­
tained without the support and involvement of large numbers of people committed to shared values and goals they deem worthy.
Indeed, one need look
no further than the business section of the morning newspaper to read of how yet another "blue chip"
 
American business,entrenched in and isolated by its own bureaucraq; has lost the support of its employees and customers.
This is tragic because, at heart, Americans are a hard-working, ambitious and generous people. They want more than  a steady  job and paycheck. They want their work to be meaningful and challenging. They want their efforts to contribute to a goal that is not just worthwhile to themselves and their families, but to  their co-workers  and the communities in which they live.
This is the essence of The Home Depot's philosophy of doing busi­ ness and primarily accounts for our seven consecutive years of record earnings and sales. Accordingly,
our annual report this year honors our 39,000 men and women - young and old, of all races
and colors - all of whom bleed orange.
