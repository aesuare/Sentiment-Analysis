Letter to Shareholders
 2002 was a successful year for $269 million after capital expenditures lead our industry into its next technical
Autoliv for many reasons.
• We achieved record-breaking sales of $4.4 billion, an increase of 11%. Excluding acquisitions and currency effects, organic growth was 6%. Global vehicle production increased by approximately 2% and the supply value of safety systems per vehicle at approximately the same rate. Hence, Autoliv achieved its target to outgrow the global market.
• Costs were contained and, in relation to sales, reduced. This was partly a result of the restructuring program announced in October 2001 and the continuing move of production to low-labor-cost countries. In 2002, we created 1,900 jobs there (see graph). Currently, Autoliv has 30% of its employees in these countries, compared to less than 10% four years ago. Conse- quently, Autoliv is on track to reach the 35% target we have set for the Company.
• Return on equity has improved on a year-over-year basis for each quarter during 2002. The average return on equity for the year exceeded 9%.
• The five-year trend of increasing levels of working capital was broken. This reduction was achieved despite the higher sales and the move to low-labor- cost countries. In relation to annual sales, working capital was reduced from 11.0% at the beginning of the year to 8.7% at the end. This was in compliance with our target that working capital should not exceed 10% of sales.
• Cash flow hit record highs of $509 million before investing activities, and
and acquisitions. The net cash flow corresponds to 14% of Autoliv’s mar- ket capitalization at the end of 2002. Although this cash flow yield may not be sustainable long-term, it certainly contributes to Autoliv’s target of being an attractive investment for the stock market.
generation: active safety. We will also focus on traffic accidents and car occupant groups that have not yet been properly addressed, such as pe- destrians and the growing population of the elderly.
We see so many opportunities within automotive safety that we have no need to expand in other areas outside our core business. Funds and re- sources that Autoliv does not need for its core business are better returned to shareholders, allowing us to focus on what we do best.
Autoliv will remain the vehicle manu- facturers’ first-choice supplier partner mainly by offering:
- Technical leadership
- Complete system capabilities - Cost efficiency
- Quality excellence
- Global presence
- Dedicated and motivated employees
Implementation
During 2002, we implemented this strategy in several ways.
Technical leadership was evidenced by the introductions of the world’s first anti-sliding bag (see page 9) and smart seat belt system with adaptive load lim- iters. In addition, we increased the num- ber of patent applications by 50% (see page 10). We also drove the Night Vision and Pedestrian Protection projects (see pages 12 and 13) closer to completion.
The system capabilities of Autoliv were strengthened by the acquisition of Visteon Restraint Electronics. Autoliv now offers the same capability in North America to deliver complete airbag
  • Net debt was
amounted to 29% in relation to total capitalization, creating a comfortable distance to the 40% cap in Autoliv’s gearing policy (see page 27).
• Due to Autoliv’s strong cash flow and strong balance sheet, the Board has decided not only to raise the dividend by 18%, but also to reactivate Autoliv’s share repurchase program. The first time the higher quarterly dividend will be paid is in March. The share buy- backs started during the fourth quarter 2002, when 1.6% of the shares out- standing were repurchased for nearly $30 million.
• Order intake during 2002 was also a record high. The real difference com- pared to previous years was the strong order intake from Asian car manufac- turers. Their orders reached the level of the contracts received from Autoliv’s traditional customers in Europe.
Vision
We intend to remain the industry leader, but with an even stronger leadership position. We plan to expand in markets where there is still plenty of room for market share gains such as in Asia. Along with staying in the technical fore- front of passive restraints we plan to

Furthermore, Autoliv’s system capabilities were ev- idenced in the EuroNCAP tests, Europe’s leading crash test program, where two car models for which Autoliv has had the safety-system responsibil- ity were among the few vehicles that received the 5-star top rating.
Cost efficiency remains top priority for Autoliv. In November, we announced a program expected to save $5 million in 2003 and then $20 million annually. In 2002, we also sold Autoliv’s non-core steel stamping company in France, in accord- ance with our outsourcing strategy. We also opened a new seat belt plant in Poland, which will enable us to move more production to low-labor-cost countries.
Quality excellence was evidenced by receiving such prestigious awards as “The Excellent Award for Quality Performance” from Toyota and “The Top Supplier Award” from Mitsubishi North America.
Global presence is one of Autoliv’s com- petitive edges. During 2002, we strength- ened that advantage by opening a large plant in Korea and by being first to open an airbag plant in China. Sales in Japan, Korea and China rose by close to 25% in 2002 and the order intake from these cus- tomers skyrocketed. We estimate that within two years, Autoliv will have more than one billion dollars in consolidated sales in Asia, twice as much as in 2002.
Our dedicated and motivated employees have achieved these re- sults. They have done a fine job over many years, for which I am very grate- ful. We are committed to continually developing their skills, knowledge and potential even more.
Outlook for 2003
For the full year 2003, light vehicle pro- duction is expected to show a modest decrease of 2-4%. Strong vehicle reg- istration in the fourth quarter of 2002, due to various incentives, may indicate that some of this year’s sales were pulled into 2002. This could lead to a somewhat slow start in 2003. However, full-year production volumes could still come in as expected.

     The acquisition of the remaining
shares in NSK’s Asian seat belt opera-
tions on April 1 will add just over $100 4,000 million to the 2003 revenues. This con-
solidation will, however, have a negli-
gible effect on Autoliv’s results.
         Assuming that the mid-February exchange rates prevail, currency ef- fects could add approximately 5% to Autoliv’s 2003 sales. Consolidated sales should also be favorably impact- ed by additional market share gains, although the gains are not expected to be as significant as in the fourth quar- ter 2002.
Consequently, we expect 2003 to be another successful year for our company.

 In low-labor-cost countries, Autoliv increased its number of employees by 1,900 in 2002 to over 9,400 or to 31% of the total number of employees. In 1998, Autoliv had 1,300 employees in these countries, corresponding to 6% of the total number.

Within two years, Autoliv expects to have one billion dollars in consolidated sales in Asia compared to less than half a billion in 2002.
Approximately half of the expected increase will be organic. The other half will come from joint ventures that will become consolidated subsidiaries.
