 2006
annual report
In 2006, we reported record earnings per share as we continued to make dramatic improvements at Dillard’s. The sweeping changes in the fashion retail sector, which began in 2005 with the consolidation of our largest two peers and the divestiture of another, continued to alter the retail landscape. We embraced the revolution as an opportunity to reach out to consumers who were reevaluating their shopping choices as their hometown retail nameplates changed. At the same time, our efforts remained focused on updating the tone of our stores to reflect our enthusiasm for fashion.
Our financial results during 2006 support our belief that we are taking the appropriate bold steps to dramatically improve our merchandise mix and, thus, our operating results. We achieved gross margin improvement in all four quarters, excluding the effect of a one-time hurricane gain in the comparable fourth quarter of 2005. We maintained our disciplined approach to merchandising and inventory control evidenced by lower levels of markdowns and declines in inventory position in all four quarters. Additionally, we executed a tight rein on our expenses so that financial accomplishments we achieved from better merchandising were not diminished by excess expenses.
In 2006, we made notable changes to our merchandise mix to appeal to customers seeking exciting statements in upscale and contemporary style. We enthusiastically supported this effort by launching a comprehensive new branding campaign, “Dillard’s – The Style of Your Life.” We believe “The Style of Your Life” goes far beyond simply serving us for a time as a tag line. To us, it is more of a mission — appropriately and concisely summarizing our approach to the marketplace and our complete desire
to make customers feel good about themselves as they experience life.
Our customers’ fashion attitudes range from a preference for straight-from-the-runway style to a more moderate and understated expression. Whatever the perspective, we recognize that ‘every style has a life, every life has
a style’. At Dillard’s, we are well-positioned to provide compelling choices to empower our customers to achieve their desired results.
Accordingly, we believe these steps are crucial to further strengthening our relationships with our customers and our competitive position in 2007:
• Presenting upscale, contemporary and trend-right fashion excitement from recognized national sources that are successfully connecting with our targeted customer.
• Seeking exciting, new vendors who offer differentiated or trend-setting products and being the first to present such merchandise to the marketplace.
• Brand-building and editing of Dillard’s exclusive merchandise which provides differentiated choices to a wide array of customers.
• Continuing to practice a more disciplined approach to purchasing and inventory management, seeking to better match purchases to projected consumer demand in both quantity and mix.
• Monitoring customer response to trends and positioning ourselves to quickly replenish merchandise to which customers have reacted in a tremendously positive way.
• Effectively using information technology to edit merchandise assortments by store to meet specific preference, taste and size requirements of each local operating area.
• Continuing our focus on reliable service, dependable quality and measurable value — setting Dillard’s apart from others in the marketplace and building lasting customer relationships.
In 2007, we will open nine new Dillard’s stores in
some of America’s most vibrant communities. Seven
of these locations will be in exciting open-air centers where customers are presented with multiple choices in shopping, dining and entertainment in the regions’ premier new mixed-use destinations. The other two locations, in Evansville, Indiana and Frisco, Texas, arise from our acquisition of stores in established, successful malls where the industry consolidation presented us with opportunities to enter promising new markets.
The Dillard’s nameplate, and the 68-year legacy it represents, remained constant in 2006 as the retailing landscape in America’s communities continued along its path of change. However, in all our 328 stores and in the supportive network that serves them, changes were occurring at Dillard’s, as well. In 2007, we will continue to provide “The Style of Your Life” for America’s shoppers with even more commitment to improving our results. We thank our shareholders and associates for their continuing contributions to this effort.
