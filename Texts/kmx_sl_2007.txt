    Letter To Shareholders
 Tom Folliard
President and Chief Executive Officer
Fiscal 2007 was an exceptionally strong year for CarMax.
A number of factors contributed to our continued success last year, including steady improvement in our operational initia- tives and increased traffic in our stores and on carmax.com. As a result, we reported growth in sales and gross margins for both retail and wholesale vehicle sales, and CarMax Auto Finance (CAF).
In fiscal 2007, net income increased 48% on a sales increase of 19%, which included 9% growth in comparable store used vehicle units. We believe our strong sales growth was fueled by the combination of expanded CarMax brand awareness, which drove more customers to our stores and our website, and con- tinued excellent execution by our store teams. Sales were fur- ther supported by a number of marketing enhancements in our Internet, television, and radio advertising, and by a variety of improvements to our website, carmax.com, all of which we will continue to refine in fiscal 2008.
Better overall execution also helped improve our gross mar- gins, which increased for all categories of vehicles — used, whole- sale, and new. Better execution can be best and most simply characterized as better vehicle buying, reconditioning, and selling.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
We learn more and improve our systems each year, as we add to our continually-expanding and industry-leading database of infor- mation on used vehicles. We also continue to improve our whole- sale vehicle auctions by increasing our operational efficiency and expanding the services offered to dealer participants.
CAF income grew by 27% in fiscal 2007. CAF offers competi- tive financing and thus provides qualifying customers with
a dependable financing option that is profitable and risk- controlled for CarMax. For alternative financing, CarMax partners with several strong third-party lenders. Most of these lenders pay us a fixed fee per origination in return for loan portfolios that we estimate are significantly less risky than their other auto loan portfolios due to the straightforward way CarMax manages financing and the meticulous reconditioning of our vehicles. Our lenders benefit from the superior quality of our informa- tion, which allows them to make better financing decisions.
We are very excited by our future growth opportunities. The vast size of our marketplace and our unique consumer offer are just two of the elements that distinguish the CarMax growth story. Although we reported $7.5 billion in revenues in fiscal 2007 and are the largest retailer of used cars in the United States, we still had only 77 used car superstores open at year end, and represented only about 2% of the estimated $290 billion market for 1- to 6- year-old used cars.
We opened 10 stores in fiscal 2007, growing our store base by 15%, consistent with our long-term objective of 15% to 20% annual store growth. We expect to open an additional 13 stores in fiscal 2008, a 17% store growth rate. This rate of growth suggests that we could double our store base in the next five years, and have consistent, sustainable growth over the next decade. We believe this significant growth trajectory distin- guishes CarMax from most U.S. retailers.
We are fortunate to currently have no similar-format, multi- market competitors, but we will never be complacent. Concept innovation, including ongoing analysis and operational initia- tives, is an important focus for CarMax. We constantly look for

 CARMAX 2007
 
    CarMax, Inc. is the nation’s largest retailer of used cars. Our unique consumer offer is structured around four core equities: low, no-haggle prices; a broad selection; high-quality vehicles; and customer-friendly service. During fiscal 2007, we retailed 337,021 used vehicles and sold 208,959 wholesale vehicles at our in-store auctions. As of February 28, 2007, we operated 77 used car superstores in 36 markets.
ways to improve our processes and grow our market share, which we believe is the best way to maintain our competitive advantage. We utilized this kind of innovative analysis in
the development of our small format stores and car buying centers, concepts that we are currently testing.
Most fundamental to our past success, however, and key to our future growth, are our associates. Our associate selection process, ongoing development and training pro- grams, and focus on associate engagement benefit both the company and our associates.
I also want to thank Austin Ligon, who retired as CEO last year, for all his contributions to CarMax. Rick and Austin were instrumental in the original concept and creation of CarMax. At the same time, let me welcome our most recent addition to CarMax’s Board of Directors. Ed Grubb, retired executive vice president and chief financial officer of Transamerica Corporation, adds extensive retail, operational, and financial expertise to our board.
I’d like to also take this opportunity to thank all of our 13,700 associates for their hard work and dedication. I am continually impressed by the consistent commitment to team- work and customer service evidenced in every CarMax store, from our very first in Richmond, Virginia, to our most recent store, opened in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. And finally, I would like to thank our other stakeholders — vendors, suppliers, partners, and shareholders — for their role in supporting CarMax and our ongoing quest for excellence.
Sincerely,
Tom Folliard

Engaged associates find personal fulfillment while also provid- ing the innovation that supports the company’s goals. For the third year in a row, Fortune named CarMax to their “100 Best Companies to Work For” list, a tribute in which we all take great pride. Of the many aspects of CarMax that are unique and that make us successful, our culture is perhaps the most difficult for others to duplicate.
 Before closing, let me express our appreciation and best wishes to Rick Sharp, our chairman, who will retire in June.
