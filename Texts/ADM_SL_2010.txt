Serving Vital Needs TM

Dear Shareholders: In my letter to you last year, I noted that the global economic outlook was uncertain, that markets were skittish, and that consumers were wary in response. We anticipated a tough year, and it was. Net earnings, operating profit and return on invested capital declined as negative margin structures in some businesses and reduced global crop supply presented significant challenges. As a company that aspires to consistent excellence, we are not satisfied with our financial results for the year. We are, however, confident that we are taking the right actions to build ADM's earnings power and improve shareholder returns. These actions include: · Improving portfolio management and capital allocation to achieve better returns. In 2012, we shuttered several underperforming assets that did not meet our objectives for profits or returns. Our investments--both acquisitions and capital expenditures--are made in regions where demand for crops and protein is growing. We are expanding our crop sourcing, processing and export capacity in key supply regions--including South America, Eastern Europe and the United States--as we build our destination business in Asia and the Middle East. In the largely mature North American and Western European markets, we are optimizing existing assets and balancing output to meet market needs. These actions reflect enhanced discipline in capitalallocation to improve overall returns on capital. Reducing overhead costs. We are completing a workforce reduction, lowering energy costs, reducing contractor expense and streamlining work processes. These efforts will drive more than $150 million in annual run-rate savings by March 2013. Strengthening our balance sheet. With elevated working capital requirements due to high crop prices, we have bolstered our liquidity position and worked to free up cash to maintain the flexibility needed to capitalize on emerging growth opportunities. Returning nearly $1 billion to shareholders. In 2012, share repurchases totaled $527 million. In November, we increased our quarterly dividend from 16 to 17.5 cents per share, and during the fourth quarter, we issued our 323rd consecutive quarterly payment--a record of 80 years of uninterrupted dividends.

As we continue to improve our earnings power, we are encouraged by the strengths of our business model. Consider: · Just outside the farm gate, where our value chain begins, we can purchase grain from a farmer in the U.S., Paraguay or Poland and either store it at one of our more than 400 worldwide sourcing facilities for sale at a later date; transport it to one of more than 260 processing plants; or quickly resell it to a commercial buyer in Mexico, Egypt or China. This provides us significant flexibility in an often-volatile marketplace. Through our unparalleled transportation and logistics network, we match the lowest-cost fulfillment route with the highest-value destination opportunity: For a buyer in China, we can transport grain from the U.S. Midwest to St. Louis by railcar, ship it downriver to New Orleans by barge, then load it onto one of our Panamax vessels. Or, we can access grain from interior regions of Brazil, truck it to Santos port, and ship it to the same destination. Because of our global sourcing and transportation network, we have the ability to obtain crops from any growing region in the world, helping our customers resolve local supply-demand imbalances that challenge their global supply chains. At our processing plants, we manufacture hundreds of products--food ingredients, animal feeds and renewable fuels and chemicals--and we maintain flexibility to adjust our output based on seasonal demand, margins and market needs. In addition, our research and development teams continue to work with customers and devise ways to create higher-value, higher-margin products from several crop inputs: corn, oilseeds, wheat and cocoa.

Looking ahead, as this letter was headed to press, a historic U.S. summer drought was expected to result in low crop carryouts, with the impact felt in several of our businesses and by our customers. We have an exceptional and experienced business team, solid financial resources and an outstanding work force to manage through this environment and assist our customers, as we continue serving the vital needs of a growing global population. A final note: This report reaches you about halfway through an abbreviated, six-month fiscal year. Our next Form 10-K and proxy statement will cover July 1 to Dec. 31, 2012. On Jan. 1, 2013, ADM will move to calendar-year reporting, aligning our fiscal year with the calendar year. This shift was prompted both by our interest in making our global financial reporting more efficient, and by a desire to better serve investors by simplifying year-over-year comparative analysis. I look forward to sharing details of our half-year's performance with you next March, and to working each and every day to create value for you.
