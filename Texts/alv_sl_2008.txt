 President’s Letter
Dear Shareholder,
First of all, I would like to extend a sincere “thank-you” to our employees for their continued support in ensuring quality, safety, and timely deliveries, as well as in executing our action program – all during a very challenging year.
In 2008, vehicle production dropped significantly, especially towards the end of the year. Credit mar- kets dried up. Raw material prices skyrocketed. Some customers were on the verge of ceasing payments and one customer – Ssangyong in Ko- rea – placed itself in court receivership immedi- ately after the turn of the year.
In response to this unprecedented turmoil we:
• introduced an action program already in July. We saw early signs of a slowdown at the begin- ning of the summer. This led us to take asser-
tive actions before many other companies.
• managed to raise $250 million in new medium- term credits after the bankruptcy of the Lehman
Brothers and the ensuing credit crisis.
• conserved cash by reducing and then suspending
dividends and the share repurchase program.
As a result, Autoliv has been able to preserve its strong financial position, which we believe is critical during the current challenging econom- ic times.
Our actions also helped offset some of the neg- ative effects from sharply declining light vehicle pro- duction and higher raw material inflation costs.
Rapid Response
In 2008, light vehicle production (LVP) dropped by 12% in North America and Western Europe combined where Autoliv generates more than

70% of sales. As a result, sales declined by 4%. Income was also negatively affected by higher raw materials and higher severance and restruc- turing costs than in 2007. All these events had a combined negative effect of more than $210 mil- lion. The peaking raw material prices also caused us to miss our target for direct material cost re- ductions (see graph page 9).
Due to these headwinds, we were forced to take several severe actions including headcount reductions of 14% or nearly 5,900 during the 2nd half of 2008 (see graph below). This swift adjust- ment was possible thanks to the flexibility cre- ated during many years of production moves to low-cost countries and by our strategy to have a relatively high portion of temporary workers and other non-fixed employees, especially in high-cost countries. These actions mitigated the decline in operating income by $196 million and enabled Autoliv to still report an operating prof- it of $306 million and an operating margin of 4.7%, including restructuring costs. Earnings per share was $2.28.
These results are not satisfactory to our stand- ards, but better than most comparable companies and show that we are prepared and able to act fast and decisively when it is required.
Even after the substantial headcount reduc- tions in 2008, 9% of our workforce or 3,300 peo- ple are temporary or other non-fixed employees. This will provide further flexibility during 2009.
Strong Cash Position
Another important strategy, especially in the midst of the credit crisis, has been cash generation and cash preservation. Operations generated $614 million in cash, the second best cash flow ever and well in line with our target (see page 9).
This strong cash flow was partially due to the fact that we reduced capital expenditures in re- sponse to lower light vehicle production. As a re- sult, for 2008, capital expenditures were $68 mil- lion less than depreciation and amortization. We expect this difference to continue in 2009. The strong cash flow was also due to a reduction of working capital from 9.1% of sales at the end of 2007 to 8.0%, well below the cap of 10% in our policy. We also continued, with ample headroom, to be in compliance with our other two internal fi- nancial policies, leverage ratio and interest cov- erage (see page 9).
At the end of 2008, we had almost half a billion dollars in cash on hand compared to upcoming capital market debt maturities during 2009 of ap- proximately $400 million (see graph on page 3). Therefore, we believe that our Company should be able to repay our debt even in the event that one of our major refinancing sources, i.e. the commer- cial paper market, may not be available.
In addition, we have a $600 million unutilized revolving credit facility that is available until No- vember 2012 and more than $60 million in other facilities with shorter maturities, besides all over-

Therefore, I think it is safe to say that Autoliv’s cur- rent financial position is sound.
However, light vehicle production is expected to remain on a low level throughout 2009 and mar- ket interest rates could remain high, even if dis- count rates from central banks have been reduced and are likely to be reduced even more. Further- more, most of the remaining cash outlays for the action program which we have provided for in 2008 will be realized during 2009. In addition, we entered 2009 with unusually low receivables due to the sharp sales decline in December 2008. Last- ly, restructuring costs could turn out to reach the same level as in 2008, and the risk for customer and supplier defaults is not over yet. Hence, we believe it is prudent to preserve a strong cash po- sition and have decided to suspend the quarterly dividend in addition to the suspension of share re- purchases and the other cash-improving meas- ures already implemented.
“Small Car Project”
The trend in auto sales goes clearly towards smaller and more fuel-efficient vehicles. Howev- er, small cars have at least twice the fatality rates of larger vehicles, according to field data from both the U.S. and Western Europe.
To offset this disadvantage that small cars have – “by law of physics” – they need more safety sys- tems than bigger vehicles. However, today it is the

other way around: the safety content in small car (the A and B segments of the market) is often half of the value in the middle and higher segments (C to F), and, for instance, in India, the average safe- ty value per vehicle is only one tenth of the safest vehicles in Western Europe.
This will have negative implications not only on traffic fatalities and injuries, which is the most se- rious drawback, but it also makes it difficult for Au- toliv to grow organic sales faster than global light vehicle production. In 2008, this was the main rea- son why we did not reach our target to outperform

the global occupant restraint market which de- clined by 7%, while our organic sales declined by 10% (see graph on page 9).
For these reasons and to save natural resourc- es and make vehicles more environmentally friend- ly, we have decided to step up our research and development budget for “small car projects” by 30%. I think it is a sign of strength that our Com- pany is able to do this in the midst of the worst challenges facing the automotive industry since the 1930’s.
We have already several products that could be especially efficient in small cars, for instance, knee airbags, active seatbelts (see page 16) and even radar thanks to our recent acquisition of Tyco’s automotive radar business (see page 16). Radar, stereoscopic camera systems, night vi- sion and other pre-crash sensing systems can provide “virtual crash zones” that compensate for the shorter physical crash zones of small ve- hicles. We now need to promote these products
and supplement them with new products from our research and development as described on page 17.
Outlook
This year is likely to become even tougher than last year, because LVP during the first nine months of 2009 is predicted to be much lower than during the same periods of 2008 when the credit crunch had not yet really hit the market. LVP in Western Europe and North America, where Autoliv gener- ates more than 70% of sales, is currently expect- ed to drop by 23% and 27%, respectively, as av- erages for the year, but our customers keep adjusting their production schedules.
The negative implications this will have on margins should, to some degree, be offset by fall- ing raw material prices and our own purchasing actions. However, virtually none of this benefit is expected to materialize before summer. During 2009, Autoliv should also benefit from our cost- saving actions taken already in 2008. There could also be substantial restructuring actions and costs during 2009, possibly in the same magni- tude as in 2008.
In conclusion, we expect 2009 to start on a very weak note when cash flow will be negative given the reasons above, also (see page 40).
Consequently, Autoliv’s financial position and especially our Company’s cash position will be an important asset awaiting the recovery of the automotive industry, which always has and al- ways will be very cyclical.
Yours sincerely,
Jan Carlson
