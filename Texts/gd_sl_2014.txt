Dear Fellow Shareholder: 2014 was a very good year for General Dynamics. Our continued focus on expanding margins, generating cash and increasing return on invested capital resulted in record-setting financial performance. Our operating earnings, margins, free cash flow, earnings from continuing operations and earnings per share in 2014 were the highest in the company's history. The market rewarded that performance with a 44 percent increase in our stock price, driving our market capitalization to $45.7 billion at year-end. We also expanded our foundation for future success by increasing total backlog 58 percent from $45.9 billion at year-end 2013 to $72.4 billion at the end of 2014. This large and durable backlog positions us for growth in 2016 and beyond. In 2014, operating earnings were $3.9 billion on sales of $30.9 billion, an operating margin of 12.6 percent. We earned a return on sales of 8.7 percent, a return on invested capital of 15.1 percent, a return on assets of 7.6 percent and a return on equity of 20.2 percent. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.7 billion, an increase of 20 percent over 2013. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, was $3.2 billion, which represents 120 percent of earnings from continuing operations. Your management team used that cash to pay $822 million in dividends and repurchase more than 29 million shares. Prudent deployment of capital remains a focus going forward. On March 4, 2015, the Board increased the quarterly dividend by 11.3 percent from 62 cents per share to 69 cents per share, the 18th consecutive annual increase. This consistent, repeatable dividend policy provides the foundation for additional return of capital to our shareholders. As you can see from the attached financial statements, each of our four business groups contributed to our successful and record-setting year. The Aerospace group achieved strong operating leverage with margins of 18.6 percent, 120 basis points better than the prior year on sales growth of 6.5 percent. Over the course of the year, we announced three new large-cabin business-jets, the G500, the G600 and the G650 extended-range (ER). The G500 and G600 are newdesign aircraft that optimize speed, wide-cabin comfort, efficiency and advanced safety technology. These two aircraft enter into service in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The G650ER entered into service ahead of schedule in 2014 and flies farther at faster speeds than any other

business jet on the market. Orders for the new aircraft and continued demand for existing models and completions projects resulted in an increase in total potential contract value for the group over the prior year and positions us well for the future. In 2014, Combat Systems had $5.7 billion in sales with 15 percent margins. Strong cost control allowed the group to successfully compete for and win contracts, bringing the group's backlog to an all-time high of $19.8 billion. With each of our businesses' strong operating leverage and historic-high backlog, Combat Systems is poised for growth. Marine Systems revenues grew by 8.9 percent to $7.3 billion, and margins were a solid 9.6 percent. Navy construction work at each shipyard increased as we executed on the Virginia-class submarine, Mobile Landing Platform and destroyer programs. Commercial ship construction also increased over the course of the year on the 10 commercial ships now under contract. Marine Systems also had significant growth in backlog with the addition of the Virginia-class submarine Block IV contract for 10 submarines, ending the year with $30.8 billion in backlog. The Marine group will continue to grow as we execute on this backlog. Our Information Systems and Technology businesses improved their margins to 8.6 percent, with earnings down only 1.3 percent in the face of a 10.8 percent revenue decline. In January 2015, we integrated two business units, Advanced Information Systems and C4 Systems, into the new Mission Systems business. This consolidation will improve cost competitiveness, leverage the businesses' complementary capabilities and increase responsiveness to our customers. Order activity was strong, and the actions we are taking to restructure the group will further position it for growth in 2016 and beyond. In closing, we began 2014 with a commitment to hold steadfast to our focus on improving margins, generating cash and increasing return on invested capital. Our performance in 2014 demonstrates the success of this approach. This course of action will continue through 2015 and beyond as we drive increased growth and higher earnings across your company.
