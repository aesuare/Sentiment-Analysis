“In 2011, we created value for our customers, transformed our business, and invested to grow– and the results were rewarding.”
D. Scott Davis,
UPS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

                UPS delivered another year of
stellar performance in 2011.
In more than 220 countries and territories around the world, our employees provided logistics solutions and served customers with reliability that is unmatched in our industry.
UPS achieved record earnings per share (ePS) in 2011, well surpassing our previous peak in 2007. our operating margin and free cash flow are the envy of our industry.
the financial results of our business segments demonstrated our adaptability.
• Our U.S. Domestic segment produced strong revenue growth, the highest operating profit since 2007, and significant margin expansion in a slow growth environment.
• UPS International operations achieved record revenues on strong volume growth that continued to outpace the market. this performance was quite impressive given tumultuous economic conditions around the world in 2011.
• In the Supply Chain and Freight segment, we upgraded our capabilities, and continued to achieve new highs in operating profit with balanced contributions from all business units.
At our Investor Conference in 2011, we showed that UPS is the market leader in cutting-edge technologies
and unique customer solutions. We also announced aggressive long-term targets. Some of these targets are: EPS growth of 10 to 15 percent, ROIC in excess of
25 percent, and Free Cash Flow conversion greater than 100 percent of net income. our performance and our focus on shareholder returns makes UPS a blue-chip stock that belongs in any investment portfolio.
UPS Strategy
as I mentioned in my letter last year, the UPS strategy has three key tenets: create value for our customers, transform our business, and invest for growth. In 2011, we executed this strategy and the results were rewarding.
Creating Value
During the past year, UPS introduced a variety of innovative solutions.
to support the needs of the fast growing Business- to-Consumer (B-to-C) market, we launched
UPS My ChoiceSM in the United States. this ground- breaking offering allows the receivers of UPS shipments to control aspects of the delivery. We are pleased with how this product has been received. after unveiling UPS My Choice in October 2011, the number of new subscribers approached 750,000 by the end of the year.
to assist our customers with reverse logistics, we introduced UPS Returns® Exchange and UPS Returns® Pack and Collect. these two unique solutions provide retailers in north america and europe with new and cost-efficient ways to process returns.

Investing to Grow
We believe in the power of global trade to drive economic growth and improve living standards, and were heartened in 2011 that the United States passed three free trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. UPS continues to invest in its global portfolio of customer solutions to support the rapid growth of trade and cross-border commerce.
Latin America is experiencing robust economic growth, and in 2011 we announced a strategic partnership with Deprisa in Colombia. In Brazil, we expanded our healthcare facilities. We also opened UPS Capital® financial services offices in Peru and Colombia.
UPS also is expanding capacity in the important pan-European market, announcing a $200 million expansion of the Cologne Air Hub that will result in a 70 percent increase in package sorting capabilities.
The UPS International Air network added new direct flights from Hong Kong to Cologne. This upgrade allows UPS to make overnight small package deliveries to Europe. UPS offers the widest guaranteed next-day delivery coverage for both packages and heavy freight in the Europe to Asia trade lane. We also added new flights to Chengdu, China; South Korea; and Guam.
Helping the Community
While we were busy executing our strategy during 2011, UPS was also actively involved in communities around

the globe. After the terrible tsunami and earthquake in Japan, UPS emergency logistics response teams rushed into action and provided local authorities with our logistics expertise. The same was done in response to severe weather events in the United States. Along with financial support, we helped provide emergency supplies and necessary equipment.
Our involvement in the communities we serve and
the dedication of UPS people worldwide have earned widespread recognition. FORTUNE magazine again rec- ognized UPS as the world’s most admired transportation company, and The Reputation Institute ranked us
No. 1 in the industry. We’re also quite proud of the University of Michigan’s American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) ranking of UPS as No. 1 in the express delivery industry.
Looking Ahead
While 2011 was a great year for UPS, we are looking forward to 2012. UPS will celebrate 105 years of excellence and achievement in August this year.
UPS will be responsible for virtually all the distribution and logistics services for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We’ve put together an integrated supply chain solution that includes venue logistics services, warehousing services and a distribution network that will collect and deliver everything from documents to heavy freight. UPS also will be responsible for all customs clearance, freight forwarding and courier services before, during, and after the London Games.

Our brand is respected around the world and our investments have positioned us to benefit from economic growth.

  As we begin 2012, growth in the Euro zone and
Asia is slowing, while the United States economy is improving at a modest rate. Our expectation is for mixed economic growth around the world in 2012. Overall we expect global economic expansion to be slightly weaker than 2011.
In spite of the macro outlook, UPS expects another record performance, with earnings per share in a range of $4.75 to $5.00. That’s an increase of 9 to 15 percent over 2011 adjusted* earnings of $4.35.
New Opportunities
I remain confident that our competitive differentiators are sustainable for the long term. Our brand is respected around the world, and our global investments have positioned us to benefit from economic growth and expanding global commerce. Our superior worldwide capabilities are unique in our industry. In our long history, our heritage and legacy of intellectual property is difficult to match. Our track record of strong cash generation will continue to provide us with opportunities to reinvest and reward shareowners. Finally, our strong culture of reinventing our business model will ensure we meet the ever-changing needs of supply chains around the world.
We have put another great year in the books and now look with excitement at new opportunities in 2012. UPSers are ready to deploy our assets and know-how to provide competitive advantages for our customers. At the same time, our investors should enjoy another year of record earnings per share. UPS is uniquely positioned to capitalize on economic expansion, demographic changes, and market development around the world.
