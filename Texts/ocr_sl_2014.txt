                 DEAR STOCKHOLDERS, CUSTOMERS & EMPLOYEES
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, we have been focused on executing a strategy to transform our company’s operations to better leverage Omnicare’s unique position within the healthcare sector. We entered 2014 with a sense of urgency to continue this journey, and we are proud of our results. In 2014, we generated record performances in revenues of $6.42 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $718 million and adjusted cash earnings per share
of $3.72, enabling us to return $316 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are encouraged about this past year’s progress from a financial and operational perspective, and we believe we are now better positioned for the opportunities in 2015 and beyond.
POSITIVE INDUSTRY DYNAMICS
As you know, the demographics of our country are rapidly changing. Within the next five years, the senior population is expected to increase by 17%, resulting in greater demand for patient services. At Omnicare, we play a critical role in meeting the clinical needs
of this segment. We are the nation’s largest dedicated senior care pharmacy provider, and our expertise in geriatric care is vital to ensuring a high quality of life for this important patient population. The patients we serve within our institutional pharmacy business reside in a variety of settings, ranging from skilled nursing facilities
to independent living communities, each with different growth attributes. While certain elements of our offering are customized
to meet the specific needs in these various care settings, our underlying value proposition remains consistent: providing a comprehensive pharmacy management solution that is unavailable through traditional pharmacy channels. In an era of healthcare that is increasingly focused on value-based reimbursement, our comprehensive clinical offering positions us well to be the provider of choice for this growing and critical segment of the population.

is to ensure patients can access innovative therapies that often face access challenges due to their high costs, supply limitations or administration challenges. Similar to our institutional pharmacy business, our Specialty Care Group connects patients with their needed therapy and provides supporting clinical services. As drug development
trends are increasingly composed of these specialty products, we have accelerated

our path to become a diversified healthcare services company through the continued growth of our Specialty Care Group. In 2014, our specialty business generated revenue growth of 21% and exited the year representing 27% of our total company revenues compared
to less than 10% in the first quarter of 2010. With a pipeline of drugs
in development that target oncology, neurology and other complex disease states that are expected to grow 10.5% annually through 2020, we expect our Specialty Care Group will continue to be a growth driver for our investors in the future.
OPERATING EFFICIENCY
As we continue to prepare for the expected increase in demand for healthcare services, we are cognizant of the cost dilemma this could create for our country. Therefore, we have instituted broad-based plans to lower our cost structure and better leverage our scale position across our business. In 2014, we implemented several initiatives
to enhance operating efficiencies across our network through infrastructure optimization, process standardization and organizational streamlining. These initiatives contributed to our $31.5 million
decline in SG&A expense. This past year we also made a significant change to our drug sourcing strategy that we believe will lower our procurement costs. In response to a rapidly evolving pharmaceutical supply chain, we conducted an extensive review of our various sourcing alternatives to determine the best path forward. We concluded that aggregating our generic procurement volumes with our primary distributor would be more efficient than buying products directly from a manufacturer as we had done previously. We look forward to the benefits of this new sourcing strategy and our other ongoing operating efficiencies, which we expect to be key growth drivers while enabling us to make a bigger impact on the cost of patient care.
CASH GENERATION CAPABILITIES
We have structured our company to become more efficient, which we believe has supported our cash generation abilities. In 2014, we generated operating cash flows of $492 million. Discounting a $120 million settlement pertaining to a legacy legal item, cash

                              flows were $612 million, which is the highest cash flow level in our company’s history. We also diligently deployed these cash flows, returning 64% of our operating cash flows to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With respect to dividends, we increased our cash dividend rate by 10% in 2014, marking the fifth consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend. We also took steps to better position our shareholders to participate in our growth, through a series of transactions to replace a portion of our outstanding convertible debt obligations with long-term fixed interest rate bonds. We believe we are better positioned financially, and we intend to continue utilizing strategies to deploy our cash flows for the benefit of our investors.
STRUCTURED FOR CONTINUED GROWTH
We accomplished our financial goals in 2014 and implemented a number of initiatives that are instrumental to our ongoing transformation into a stronger operating entity. We have shifted to a more centralized organizational structure, better positioning our company to capitalize on the multitude of clinical and related pharmacy services that
we provide to manufacturers, prescribers, caregivers and patients. We also structurally enhanced our operational position through a new sourcing strategy, a wide range of operating efficiencies, better collaboration with our payers, and more targeted sales and marketing
programs across our business. We accomplished this while achieving 9% growth in adjusted cash EPS.
Our success in 2014 is a reflection of the dedication and support of our 12,000 employees, who are all committed to delivering high-quality care to the more than 1.1 million patients we serve. Our employees contribute to the value we provide to our customers
and shareholders. As we look ahead, we are excited about our prospects. We believe our company is strategically aligned with the future of healthcare delivery and operationally positioned to maximize returns for our investors.
