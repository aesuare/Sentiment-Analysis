 Gene Lee Jeffrey C. Smith President and Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer
DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
We experienced meaningful change in leadership in fiscal 2015 beginning with the election of a new Board of Directors. The new Board appointed a new Chairman of the Board and then selected a new Chief Executive Officer. This level of change in leadership is virtually unprecedented and provided our team with the clear mandate from shareholders to improve the Company, think differently and challenge past methods in favor of potential improved actions.
We are in the hospitality business. Success is only achieved through great people and great relationships. Our Board and our senior leadership team have quickly developed a terrific relationship of trust and partnership allowing us to align on the key priorities to drive improved business performance. We are proud of our teamwork at the top of the organization and fully recognize that it is the great work and teamwork that happens throughout the organization and in the restaurants which will allow us to continue to succeed.

  As the Board continues its transition following the 2014 Annual Meeting, Directors Betsy Atkins and Peter Feld, upon their own recommendations as members of the Nominating and Governance Committee, are not being nominated to stand for re-election. As the Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee, Betsy Atkins was the main architect of the Company’s substantial governance improvements which were designed to ensure that the Company’s policies are aligned with shareholder interests and corporate governance best practices. Peter Feld served on each of the Nominating and Governance, Compen- sation, and Finance and Real Estate Committees, and was an important voice in the establishment of the current Board as well as the decisions and operational changes made at the Company subsequent to the Board’s election in October 2014. The entire Board of Directors appreciates all that Betsy and Peter have done for Darden and wishes them well in their future endeavors.
EXECUTING A PLAN TO WIN
We will succeed by operating fantastic restaurants. In order to improve the guest experience to drive frequency and

same-restaurant sales, we have implemented a “Back to Basics” approach which is rooted in strong operating fundamentals:
• Improving culinary innovation and execution inside each of our brands;
• Delivering attentive service to each and every one of our guests; and
• Creating an inviting and engaging atmosphere inside our restaurants.
We support these priorities with smart and relevant integrated marketing programs that resonate with our guests. By delivering on these operational and brand-building imperatives, we expect to increase our market share through same restaurant sales growth and deliver best-in-class profitability.
We also recognize the unique differences of the seven full-service restaurant brands we own. We decentralized areas where it would aid the entrepreneurial decision making of each brand while further defining how the Darden support structure can enable them to achieve their ultimate potential. This includes:
1. Leveraging our scale to drive advantages in supply chain and efficient General and Administrative (G&A) support;
2. Applying insights collected from our significant guest and transactional databases to enhance guest relationships and identify new opportunities to drive sales growth; and
3. Relentlessly driving operating efficiencies and continuous improvement while ensuring a sense of urgency, account- ability and a performance-driven culture.
INCREASING SHAREHOLDER VALUE
While driving strong operational performance is our top priority, we also have the responsibility to efficiently allocate our capital and utilize our valuable assets to drive shareholder value. To that end, we recently announced a strategic real estate plan to pursue a separation of a portion of the Company’s real estate assets. The separation would be achieved through a combination of selected sale leaseback transactions and the transfer of a portion
   2

    of our remaining real estate assets to a new real estate investment trust (REIT) that would be separated by a spin-off, split-off or similar transaction, resulting in the REIT becoming an independent, publicly traded company. This decision was reached after conducting an extensive real estate evaluation process. While a significant amount of work remains, we believe this plan will achieve a favorable outcome for all of Darden’s stakeholders by strengthening our balance sheet while positioning two companies to succeed in the future.

• Finally, we continued to return significant capital to shareholders through an annual dividend of $2.20 per share. Also, using proceeds from the sale of Red Lobster completed in fiscal 2015, we retired $1.0 billion of debt and repurchased more than 10.0 million shares of stock as part of our share repurchase program. Since the share repurchase program began in 1995, we have repurchased 182 million shares of our common stock for $4.3 billion.

1. Same-restaurant sales growth;
2. Aggressive cost and capital management; and 3. Value-creating new restaurants.
