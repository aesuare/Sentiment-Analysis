Peter McCausland

In this space last year, I wrote that we were keeping a "weather eye on the U.S. economy." The storm that hit was bigger than anybody could have predicted, which is why I'm prouder than ever of our company's performance. Even after the economy dropped off a cliff in the second half of the year, our value proposition and dedicated associates came to the fore and we posted another year of record earnings and increased sales, with record operating cash flow to boot. This shouldn't surprise anybody familiar with our company. Over the past three decades, Airgas has grown from a $4 million company to a $4 billion leader in the packaged gas industry. It hasn't always been easy, but we have a history of moving forward in boom or bust times, and our long-term view of the business has always served us well. As I write this, in June 2009, we don't yet see the light at the end of the economic tunnel. Business conditions in the U.S. industrial economy are still dreary, demand levels for some of our products remain low and there's no guarantee that it will turn around next month or next year. Still, none of that will deter us from pushing forward and pursuing the best available growth opportunities. That's the Airgas way. A strong year despite the downturn With all that occurred last year ­ from the housing collapse to auto bailouts ­ I could easily be writing about the worst financial year in Airgas history. Instead, I'm writing about the best. Sales increased 8 percent to $4.3 billion and we posted record earnings of $3.12 per diluted share, up 17 percent from $2.66 in the previous year. This strong performance was driven by healthy sales growth in the first half of the year and our ability to quickly curtail costs and capital spending in response to the slowing economy in the second half of the year. We also reached $328 million in free cash flow, a 46 percent increase from the previous year and the highest level in our company history. In a down economy, our free cash flow actually rises because our capital spending reverts to

maintenance levels, working capital shrinks, and variable expenses fall. The increase in cash flow means we can pay down debt and realize interest savings, and gives us the flexibility and resources to pursue our growth strategies. Last year, we completed 14 acquisitions, adding more than $205 million in annual revenues. This coming year, potential sellers will be harder to find, as they step back to assess their business in the wake of economic challenges. We will, however, continue to be aggressive in our search for businesses that bolster our core gas business, strengthen our adjacent offerings and give us entry into new markets. Our solid financial performance even in the face of such a weak sales environment can be attributed in large part to the performance of our strategic products. Ten years ago, we expanded our business to include these higher-growth categories: bulk, medical and specialty gases; safety products, and carbon dioxide and dry ice. Today, they account for about 40 percent of our revenues and continue to outperform the traditional industrial gas and welding supply offerings. In fiscal 2009, we grew organic revenues in medical gases by 7 percent, specialty gases by 8 percent and bulk gases by 10 percent, all enviable increases in today's economy. Safety sales were up by 1 percent and carbon dioxide and dry ice were up by 2 percent, still welcome growth in a year when other gases and hardgoods were down overall. We weren't immune to the economic impact While we racked up another record year, the economic downturn certainly dampened the celebration. In the fourth quarter, we saw year-over-year declines in samestore sales and earnings. These decreases speak to the hard times now facing the industrial markets, our core customer group, but even here there are encouraging signs of life. To survive in this tough economic climate, many of our welding customers are moving forward with automation projects that require our expertise, gases and hardgoods. Larger, national customers are also implementing vendor consolidation

initiatives that play to our strength as a strategic accounts provider, able to offer the broadest product and service offering and the largest geographic scope of any competitor in the market. During times like these, our value proposition becomes more evident to customers. We're experiencing a similar good news-bad news scenario in the construction market, a growing customer segment for Airgas. On one hand, there have been cancellations and delays in highway projects and the building of coal-fired plants. On the other hand, we're selling more products to contractors building bio-fuel plants and expanding airports and refineries. And since we still have a relatively small portion of the total spend of the top U.S. construction contractors, there's definite opportunity for growth even in a slowing economy. And while we did see growth in all our strategic product categories last year, customer caution throttled down the growth rates. The positive news is that all of our strategic products have good long-term growth profiles due to cross-selling opportunities, favorable customer exposure, applications development and regulatory acceleration. Quick actions protect us now and position us for the future While no company can say that they saw the economic freefall coming, we weren't unprepared and that has helped us to minimize the impact. Airgas is a fairly conservative company. When the financial markets began heading south, we took immediate actions. At the leadership level, we made rapid adjustments in variable compensation and discretionary expenses, inventory, receivables and capital expenditures. On the front lines, our managers and associates responded with amazing speed to reign in expenses, reduce local expenditures and reach out to customers. Additionally, we had a number of our major efficiency projects already under way, including ultrasonic cylinder testing, computer-generated delivery routes and improved plant efficiencies. These projects saved millions of dollars in fiscal 2009 and will continue to reduce our expenses going forward. We also realized significant savings from acquisition synergies as a result of our unhurried approach to business integrations.

We've recently reduced annual operating expense by more than $45 million and have contingency plans ready for further cost reductions if necessary. The actions we have taken to date are saving money and making us more efficient, which will help build business over the long-term. New programs and forward progress While these cost-saving measures are necessities in today's tough times, we know we can't cut our way to success. I'm very encouraged with the amount of forward progress Airgas is making in this challenging marketplace. Overall, we increased the amount of associate training significantly, including a twenty-fold increase in on-line training. Right now, our entire organization is participating in comprehensive customer service training programs to ensure that every stage of the Airgas customer experience ­ from price quoting to gas delivery ­ is second to none. Customer service is the driving force behind a number of other business-building advances. Our OUTLOOK® service allows us to manage the supply chain of gases for our customers so they can concentrate on their primary businesses. To speed delivery of gases to new and existing customers, we recently built, acquired, or renovated a number of fill plants. And, for the longer term, we're on the front end of a multi-year phased transition to a common information platform that will make it easier for customers to do business with Airgas. In fiscal 2009, acquisitions and internal process improvements continued to strengthen our strategic product categories. In the healthcare sector, we now offer certification of medical piping systems and have introduced a cylinder rehabilitation and testing service for homecare medical distributors. Our acquisition of Oilind Safety enhanced our construction offering with the addition of air masks and gas detection equipment, and the purchase of A&N Plant expanded our range of rental equipment and gave us a presence in the European market. For specialty gas customers, we developed a returnable lecture bottle so they don't have to deal with hazardous waste disposal issues. We also acquired Refron which gave us the critical mass to form Airgas Refrigerants, a new and promising business focused on the reclamation and sale of refrigerant products used by our diversified customer base.

In the past six months, we have opened two new air separation units. Airgas now has 16 facilities producing oxygen, nitrogen and argon for pipeline and bulk delivery customers ­ and helping us build a more robust infrastructure for our growing bulk gas business. Our core strengths will carry the day I believe Airgas is striking the right balance between reasonable caution and forward progress. I'm not an economic forecaster, but I know that our business model has guided us through down times before and that we provide products and services that are essential to keeping America running. We touch all parts of America's infrastructure and have a diversified customer base ­ from factories and hospitals to construction sites and research laboratories ­ and that's why we're in a much better position than many companies to weather this economic downturn. Our associates are another powerful weapon. Airgas is a company filled from top to bottom with practical, common sense people. We're not Wall Street, we're Main Street. And our associates' ability to see what needs to be done ­ and then do it quickly and in a quality manner ­ will serve our customers and our company well as we navigate upon these uncertain waters. Sadly, this past year, we lost an associate who was with Airgas since the beginning and exemplified all of the traits we value in our employees. Todd Craun, our associate general counsel, passed away in early 2009, and we will miss him greatly. Another invaluable contributor to our company, board member Bill Albertini, also passed away. His on-target insights and informed decisions guided our company to new heights, and I'm confident that our newest board member, Ellen Wolf, will help us keep moving forward and achieving even greater goals. We're okay today and will be better tomorrow I always say that you make your money during hard times, and count it when times are good. Depending on the duration of this soft market, Airgas is probably looking at slight to moderate revenue declines across most of our product portfolio in fiscal 2010, and will continue looking for ways to take costs out of our business. These efforts will multiply the rewards we reap when the economy does rebound.

While it's not exactly business-as-usual in the short term, we remain committed to our long-term growth strategy. Our strong position in free cash flow, which allowed us to reward our shareholders with recent dividend increases, gives me confidence that we can stay on course and weather this storm. We also remain watchful for opportunities from the stimulus spending plan. A focused infrastructure build supports demand for our industrial gases, welding goods and safety supplies, and stimulus money for research and healthcare should drive demand for our specialty and medical gases. While there is still a considerable degree of economic obscurity out there, we have a great deal of clarity about the realization of our strategic vision. Our customers now benefit from a vast network of locations supported by outstanding product and process specialists across the broadest product and service offering in the industry. Every day we draw closer to being the kind of dynamic, world-class distribution organization we want to be. This coming year isn't going to be easy for any business. The best companies will succeed because of sound strategies and hard work. That's been our straightforward operating philosophy since the earliest days and it will continue to guide Airgas to new levels of success no matter what challenges we face.
