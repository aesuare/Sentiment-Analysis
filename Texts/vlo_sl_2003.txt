  letter to the shareholders
Refining — it really is an old world industry in a whole new world! That is one of the primary reasons for Valero’s record year in 2003 and the very bright future we see for 2004 and beyond.
2003 was the year when the bullish fundamentals and positive long-term trends that we have been predicting for the last several years came together in a big way.
As the chart at the bottom of this page dramatically depicts, U.S. Gulf Coast refining margins were only above $5 per barrel about 2% of the time between 1992 and 1999. However, since 2000, that margin has been over $5 per barrel nearly 30% of the time. And, as you can see, the highs have been much higher while the lows have not been as low and have been shorter in duration.
We have truly entered a new era in refining. And, as a result, 2003 was a record year for Valero in every way!
We generated a record $38 billion in revenues and ended 2003 with per share earnings of $5.09 on record net income of $622 million — the most profitable year in the company’s history!
Not surprisingly, we had a total shareholder return of 27% in 2003 alone. But what is even more impressive is the fact that our shareholders have received a 131% total cumulative return over the last five years compared to our peer group’s 31% return and the S&P 500 Index’s 3% loss over that same period!
A Record Year
In 2003, we set records in virtually every area of our business. Our Canadian operations had the best year in their history. With $390 million in operating income — $155 million better than their previous record — these operations accounted for 32% of our operating income for the year and clearly demonstrate the benefit of Valero’s geographic diversity.
Our retail division also had a record year, contributing approximately $115 million in operating income. What’s more, we achieved these record earnings with 280 fewer sites, which is a testament to the success of our strategy of investing in
the sites with potential and divesting the
under-performing stores. 13 11
Our wholesale business had a record year as
well, contributing $125 million to operating income while adding 600 new branded sites
and re-imaging more than 800 locations.
With 2,400 branded wholesale sites today,
we are on track to double our network to 1 5,000 locations by the end of 2007.

In Texas City, we completed construction of a 45,000-BPD delayed coker
and our timing couldn’t have been better! Coker margins have been well over $50
And, of course, we continued to invest in both the internal and external expansion of our refining system, which has grown from a single refinery with 170,000 barrels per day (BPD) of capacity in 1997 to a 15-refinery system with more than 2.4 million BPD of capacity today.
                       $9 per barrel since it went into full service on December 1. Obviously, with margins like these, we expect the coker will have a significant impact on 2004 earnings as well.

In terms of external expansion, I believe the St. Charles refinery in Louisiana may very well turn out to be one of the greatest acquisitions in Valero’s history. When you consider the fact that we purchased the St. Charles refinery for $400 million and the fact that more than $2 billion had been invested in the plant since 1985, we got this highly complex refinery for only 20 cents-on-the-dollar of its replacement cost.
As part of Valero’s larger system, the plant has benefited from reduced overhead costs, enhanced purchasing leverage and synergies with Valero’s other Gulf Coast facilities. The plant also has a highly motivated workforce and a bright, energetic leadership team. As a result, this plant, which we purchased out of bankruptcy, generated approximately $40 million in operating income in the six months it was part of Valero in 2003. We are currently expanding the plant, including the crude and coker units, which will increase the plant’s throughput by 30,000 BPD to 245,000 BPD. We expect this refinery will be a big contributor to operating income in 2004 and will pay for itself in less than three years.
And, while the acquisition of our new 315,000-BPD Aruba refinery actually took place in March of 2004, it was the result of significant effort in 2003 that we expect will boost our company’s earnings in 2004 and beyond. It is a great acquisition for Valero because we acquired the refinery for about 15% of its $2.4 billion replacement cost and we immediately benefited from more than $640 million which has been invested in this refinery over the last five years. The refinery benefits from processing Maya sour crude oil as one of its main feedstocks, which is currently selling at a discount of more than $9 per barrel. The refinery is a great fit for our system because it produces a high yield of intermediate feedstocks, which can be used to back out more costly third party purchases at our other refineries. And, the acquisition also included highly profitable marine, bunkering and marketing operations.
As you can see, 2003 was a record year with record accomplishments. And, I am proud to say that despite the tremendous workload that comes with a year of so many accomplishments, we maintained the unique culture of caring and sharing that is the cornerstone of Valero’s ongoing success.

 Valero and its employees donated a record $7.5 million to United Way and contributed more than 160,000 hours of volunteer time to improve the communities where we live and work. And, we were proud to once again be selected as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work for in America” by Fortune Magazine — moving up from number 70 to number 32 on the most recent ranking.
2004 to Top 2003
But as great as the year was, 2004 is shaping up to be even better! Gasoline demand is up 1.7% year-to-date — fueled by a strong economy and the ever-increasing number of SUV’s on the road. Meanwhile gasoline supplies have tightened due to increasingly stringent fuel specifications, which reduce the amount of gasoline that can be made from a barrel of oil and make it more difficult to import gasoline into
the U.S. It is not surprising then, that gasoline margins are at historic
highs. In fact, if you look at the futures market, refined product
margins are currently expected to be 20% better than 2003. And every
$1 improvement in refining margins improves Valero’s earnings by
almost $4 per share.
But that’s only the beginning, on top of that, sour crude discounts are
also currently forecast to be at least 20% better than 2003 and every
$1 improvement in the sour crude discount improves our per share
earnings by $2.25. The discounts have widened as many refiners have
turned to sweeter crude oils to meet lower sulfur fuel specifications
— making sour crude oils more surplus. Also, strong world-wide crude oil demand, spurred by a strong global economy, has increased sour crude oil production, which continues to widen the discount on the sour crude oils that make up 73% of Valero’s slate.
In addition, our throughput volumes should be 20% higher than last year. We will have a full year of contributions from the St. Charles refinery and almost 10 months of contributions from our new Aruba operations. And, we will have a full year’s benefit from the new coker in Texas City. Given all of these improvements over 2003, we expect 2004 to top 2003 in every way!
The new era for refining is here to stay. And no refiner is better positioned to benefit from it than Valero. We have grown to be one of the top refining companies in the U.S. and have the most geographically diverse and complex refining system in North America, complemented by a highly profitable and growing wholesale and retail network and a major stake in 4,500 miles of crude oil and refined product pipelines as well as product terminals and crude tanks.
We are in the right business with the right assets, the right products and the right strategy at the right time. And, we have the best employees in the industry, who really are our number one asset.
We are fortunate to see our old world industry entering a whole new world — and even more fortunate that Valero is on top of that world. And, that’s why I still say, the best is yet to come!
