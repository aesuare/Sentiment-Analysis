Pipeline Modernization
Our strategy is to grow by investing in our regulated assets to increase their safety and reliability. Through fiscal 2020, we expect to spend between $5.4 billion and $6.4 billion to replace, fortify and expand pipelines and service lines. Work is under way near Canton, Texas, on one of our largest projects. We are adding 62 miles of new pipelines to boost reliability and to meet our customers' growing demand for natural gas.

To Our Shareholders
In fiscal 2015, we made spectacular progress on our quest to become the nation's safest natural gas distributor.

575 miles
We replaced 575 miles of aging natural gas distribution and transmission pipelines to enhance the safety and reliability of our system.

148,000 hours
We provided nearly 148,000 hours of technical and safety training to our service and construction technicians to help them render even safer, more reliable and superior customer service.

Highly Advanced Technology
We began evaluating the latest and most advanced technology designed to detect pipeline leaks, and we launched a multi-year information technology project to manage and document the construction in our pipeline modernization program.

We also did very well financially.

$3.09 EPS
Earnings per diluted share grew for the 13th consecutive year in fiscal 2015, and net income increased by 8.7 percent to $315.1 million, as compared to $289.8 million in fiscal 2014.

$1.56|share
Our fiscal 2015 cash dividend was $1.56 per share. In November 2015, the board of directors continued our consecutive annual dividend increases for the 32nd year by raising the indicated rate for fiscal 2016 by 7.7 percent to $1.68 per share.

25.5 percent
Total shareholder return in fiscal 2015 was 25.5 percent.

$63.77|share
The market price of our stock reached an alltime high on November 4, 2015, of $63.77 a share.

The capital investments we are making to replace, fortify and expand our distribution and transmission assets are driving our financial results.  Since fiscal 2010, our capital spending has risen at a compounded annual growth rate of 12.4 percent to reach $975 million in fiscal 2015. More than 75 percent of our investment during the past five years has been dedicated to safety and reliability projects.  This significant increase in capital investment has occurred because most regulators in our market areas have approved constructive and balanced rate mechanisms. These mechanisms provide for the recovery of more than 90 percent of our capital within six months of the test year.

Kim R. Cocklin
Chief Executive Officer

 The balanced regulatory environments in our markets today are the result of relationships built on trust with our regulators, legislators, community leaders and customers. These relations were fostered by our former CEO and current chairman, Robert W. Best. Bob built upon the foundation laid by our founder, Charles K. Vaughan, that a successful utility is one that is trusted and is focused on providing safe, reliable and competitively priced service.

Large Investments, Yet Low Customer Bills

Regulatory authorities in the states we serve recognize the critical need to accelerate capital outlays to continue to make our safe system even safer. With the resulting rate mechanisms in place today, we plan to continue investing in our pipeline infrastructure program far into the future.  Equally important, even with these large expenditures for improvements, the average monthly bill for our service remains very affordable.  Our average residential bill, adjusted for seasonality, has averaged less than $60 a month since 2007, and we expect our residential bills will remain in that range for at least several more years.  After taking inflation into account, we expect our bills will actually go down. This positive benefit is occurring because natural gas continues to be abundant, affordable, domestically available and clean. Reputable forecasts show prices supporting this outcome for at least the next decade.  The net effect is that we are significantly upgrading our infrastructure--with all the incumbent benefits of public safety and reliability of gas deliveries even on the coldest days--without our customers paying more for these service improvements.  Atmos Energy's annualized monthly gas bills, in fact, may be one of the lowest costs in the household budget of our average residential customer, as shown on page 4.
Financial Results

Contributions to fiscal 2015 net income were $205 million from regulated distribution operations, $94 million from
22

regulated pipeline operations and $16 million from nonregulated operations.  Our financial performance continues to reflect the successful implementation of our long-term strategy of enhancing the safety and reliability of our infrastructure.  Fiscal 2015 benefited from rate outcomes approved in fiscal 2014 and 2015; they increased our regulated gross profit by $118 million.  Additionally, weather, which was 8 percent colder than normal in fiscal 2015, contributed 5 cents per diluted share of earnings for the year.  Recent rate-design changes in Tennessee, Mississippi and Colorado are expected to support increased capital investments in those states in the future.  At September 30, 2015, our balance sheet had a debtto-capitalization ratio of 47.7 percent, compared to 46.2 percent at year-end in fiscal 2014. The company also had nearly $900 million in net liquidity to meet anticipated financial needs.  In late September 2015, we replaced an existing $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement, which was set to expire in August 2019, with a new $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement through September 2020 on substantially the same terms. The new credit agreement retains an "accordion" feature, which allows us the opportunity to increase the facility to $1.5 billion.  Our strong financial position contributed to the recent upgrade of our corporate credit rating to A by Fitch Ratings and to an improvement in our outlook to Positive by Standard & Poor's.

We will continue to execute our strategy of growth by investing in our existing assets.  Our announced guidance for earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2016 ranges between $3.20 and $3.40, excluding unrealized margins. Contributions to net income from regulated operations are forecast to be between $315 million and $355 million, and net income from nonregulated operations is expected to be in the range of $14 million to $19 million.  We operate approximately 76,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipelines and more than 3.1 million service lines connected to customers' premises.  Our primary focus is to replace as soon as possible all the remaining cast iron pipe in our system and to evaluate for replacement all existing bare steel pipelines. In addition, our modernization program will continue to emphasize the replacement or fortification of older coated steel pipelines and early-vintage plastic pipe.  We have replaced nearly 1,000 miles of cast iron, bare steel and early-generation plastic pipe since 2010, and we expect to double our replacement mileage during the next five years.  We project our capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 to be between $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion and our annual capital expenditures from fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2020 to range between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion.  Our total regulated rate base value is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate between 9 percent and 10 percent, from approximately $5.5 billion at yearend of fiscal 2015 to between $8.5 billion and $9.0 billion by fiscal 2020.  Accordingly, we project that earnings per diluted share will increase between 6 percent and 8 percent a year. This growth rate, combined with an attractive dividend, should yield an overall shareholder return between 9 percent and 11 percent each year through fiscal 2020.
Management Changes

As part of our senior-management succession planning, the board of directors announced promotions for two key officers, effective October 1, 2015.  Michael E. Haefner, 55, was promoted from executive vice president to president and chief operating officer of Atmos Energy Corporation. In this role, he has oversight for Atmos Energy's regulated distribution divisions, customer service operations, regulated intrastate pipeline division, nonregulated operations and the gas supply and services group. Mike also was elected to the board of directors, effective November 4, 2015.  One of the most important responsibilities of the board is to establish for the CEO position a succession plan that is seamless and transparent to continue the success of the company. It is equally important that the plan is controlled by the board--that it is not required due to

poor operational performance, failing health or financial distress. This plan reflects the board's deliberate and careful consideration and their confidence that succession will be successful.  Mike had been executive vice president from January 2015 through September 2015 and had previously served as senior vice president of human resources.  Before joining Atmos Energy in 2008, he had worked for 10 years as senior vice president, human resources, at Sabre Holdings Corporation, the parent company of Sabre Airline Solutions, Sabre Travel Network and Travelocity. He also held leadership positions within Sabre from 1991 to 1997 while it was a division of AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines. Earlier, he had worked as an outside management consultant for Xerox Corporation and in computing research at Eastman Kodak Company.  Mike earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from St. John Fisher College and a master's degree in computer science from State University of New York at Buffalo.  Mike has the vision, experience and leadership skills, as well as the understanding of our culture and values, to ensure our continued financial and operational success.  The board of directors also named Marvin L. Sweetin, 52, to the newly created position of senior vice president, safety and enterprise services. Marvin had been senior vice president, utility operations, since 2011.  He also had served as vice president of customer service, director of technical training and director of procurement.  Before joining Atmos Energy in 2000, Marvin worked at Atlantic Richfield for 13 years in various roles, supporting petroleum exploration and production activities around the world.  He earned a bachelor's degree in petroleum engineering technology from Oklahoma State University and a master's degree in business administration from the University of Dallas.  Investing these two officers with increased responsibilities for the company's success helps ensure our progress toward becoming the safest natural gas provider. Both leaders have demonstrated managerial excellence and made valuable contributions to our company.  They are supported by our 4,800 employees, who are committed to serving our customers exceptionally well while ensuring safety for themselves, their fellow employees and the people in the 1,408 communities we serve. On our journey to becoming the safest natural gas company, we have the right employees in the right place, getting the right results the right way.
