 To Our Shareholders
  4
In 2013, we delivered on many of our financial, opera- tional and strategic commitments, while launching an effort to re-envision Sonoco to achieve future acceler- ated growth.
We delivered record sales, gross profits and cash flow from operations in 2013, while free cash flow more than doubled. Despite a recession in Europe, slowing emerging markets and higher pension and operating costs, Sonoco’s base earnings grew nearly 5% to the third highest level in Company history. We signif- icantly strengthened our balance sheet by reducing debt along with pension and post-retirement liabili- ties. Also, during the year, we began to strategically align our diversified operations to facilitate the design and delivery of 360° Customized SolutionsTM to our customers.
We also delivered on our commitment to enhance shareholder value by providing a 45.2% total return in 2013, which was nearly 30% better than the return on the S&P 500 and our best shareholder return per- formance in a quarter of a century.
Re-envisioning Sonoco
Last year, following the successful integration of the largest acquisition in our history, which provided us a strong position in custom-engineered protective packaging, we said our portfolio of packaging busi- nesses was complete and we were focused on both optimizing and enhancing our existing technologies. Yet, in order to continue to grow our businesses, par- ticularly in a period of weak global growth, we knew we must find new ways to innovate and provide value to our customers.
Our goal is to become a solutions company that just happens to offer packaging versus a packaging com- pany that offers multiple solutions. There is a distinct

difference between these two approaches and we believe this difference creates an opportunity for accelerated growth.
This year, we began assembling our unequalled range of packaging products and services, combined with a broad spectrum of technical capabilities and a unique, formalized process for innovation we call the i6 Innovation ProcessTM. This business solutions model is truly unparalleled in the markets that we serve and we believe it should allow us to fulfill our purpose of providing our customers with Innovative Packaging Solutions (IPSTM) that enhance their businesses and brands. This innovative solutions process is shown on the cover of this annual report and you can read more about how Sonoco is Enhancing Customers’ Products with Innovative Packaging SolutionsTM, by turning to pages 8 and 9.
2013 results
Net sales for 2013 increased to a record $4.85 billion,
a $62 million, or 1.3% increase from 2012. Growth in volume added approximately 1.4% to sales as almost all of the Company’s businesses recorded improvement. Higher selling prices of $30 million were achieved as we passed to our customers increased recovered paper costs and, to a lesser extent, higher consumer packa- ging raw material costs. These additions were partially offset by the Company’s decision to exit a recycled fiber operation in Europe and to sell off a small box plant.

Gross profit increased 4% to a record $874 million in 2013, compared with $844 million in 2012. Gross profit as a percent of sales increased to 18.0%, compared with 17.6% in 2012. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $23.5 million, or 5%, and were 10% of sales, compared with 9.7% of sales in 2012.
Cash generated from operations in 2013 was a record $538 million, up 33%, compared with $404 million in 2012. The improvement in cash flow from operations was due to higher GAAP earnings, lower cash taxes, working capital changes and lower pension and post- retirement benefit plan contributions, which were $42 million in 2013, compared with $75 million in 2012. Net capital expenditures and cash dividends were $168 million and $125 million, respectively, dur- ing 2013, compared with $183 million and $120 mil- lion, respectively, in 2012. Free cash flow (cash flow from operations minus net capital expenditures and cash dividends) more than doubled from $101 million last year to $245 million in 2013.
At year end, total debt was approximately $981 mil- lion, a $392 million reduction from our 2012 year- end total of $1.37 billion. In 2013, we repatriated $260 million of accumulated offshore cash, substan- tially all of which was used to repay outstanding debt. In addition, the Company had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of 2013, compared with
$152 million outstanding at December 31, 2012. The Company’s debt-to-total capital ratio was 36.3% at the end of 2013, compared with 47.7% at the end of 2012. Cash and cash equivalents were $217.6 million at year-end 2013, compared with $373.1 million at year- end 2012. The Company has an investment grade debt rating of BBB+ as established by Standard and Poor’s.

Total domestic sales were $3.2 billion, up 2%, while international sales were $1.6 billion, essentially flat with 2012.
Net income attributable to Sonoco was $219.1 million ($2.12 per diluted share) in 2013, compared with $196.0 million ($1.91 per diluted share) in 2012. Net income in 2013 was negatively impacted by after-tax restructuring and other charges of $18.4 million, net of gains from property sales and excess property insurance recoveries.
2013 base earnings were $237.5 million ($2.30
per diluted share), compared with $226.9 million ($2.21 per diluted share) in 2012. This nearly
5% increase was the result of productivity improve- ments, modest volume growth and a positive price/ cost relationship, partially offset by higher labor, pension, maintenance and other costs.

 To Our Shareholders
 Differentiating capabilities driving our success
Our performance in 2013 was driven by our targeted efforts in six key focus areas—employee safety; cus- tomer satisfaction; our efforts to grow and optimize our businesses; reducing our unit cost to produce through operational excellence; maximizing cash flow and optimizing its deployment; and underlying all of these efforts is making sure we have talented, engaged and aligned people.
I’m proud to say we made excellent strides in each of these categories in 2013. For instance:
I Safety:28feweremployeeswereinjured
I Customer Satisfaction: Credits for returned sales were reduced by 12%
I Grow and Optimize: We achieved $68 million in net organic sales growth
I OperationalExcellence:Manufacturing productivity generated $40 million in cost savings
I Cash Flow: Record cash flow from operations was achieved as working capital improved with cash gap days reduced by more than one day
I People:OuremployeesgaveSonocoa78% positive engagement score
However, to ensure we succeed in our focus areas going forward, we must develop some additional “differentiating capabilities.” I use the word “additional” because we have already developed a differentiated capability in safety. Our ability and processes in managing safety are already considered world class, and we continue to improve them.
key focus areas
In order to ensure our ability to perform at world-class levels in each of our focus areas, we are working to develop additional “differentiating capabilities” in the following:
I Ideation and Innovation
I Insights and Market Alignment I Supply Chain Excellence
I Manufacturing Excellence
I Service and Quality Excellence
To enhance our ability to fully develop each differen- tiating capability, a senior executive sponsor has been assigned to each. Their role is to work with various individuals,teamsandcouncilsthatcurrentlyexistin these areas to define what “world class” looks like, to assess where we are today and to design the path for- ward. To be successful, we are absolutely convinced we must develop and embed these five differentiating capabilitiesthroughoutSonoco.
As we enter 2014, a lot of work has already begun
in each of these capabilities, and several initiatives
are underway. For instance, we have added resources toresearchthreepilotmarkets:shaving,petfoodand a food category we call fresh and natural. We expect these pilots to help accelerate organic growth. We are introducing our proprietary customized solutions pro- cess to targeted customers in these markets and, in some cases, developing new packaging technologies to help energize their products and brands.
While we are early into this process, our customers are listening and we are starting to receive requests for help, as opposed to requests for proposals.

Looking ahead to 2014
We are excited about our prospects in 2014. While conditions in certain emerging markets may prove difficult, we have identified significant global growth opportunities. While consumer packaging volume growth has been disappointing over the past few years, we are proactively working to build our tech- nology and new product funnels to drive organic growth. As we pursue our re-envisioning, we intend to continue the cultural, structural and operational changes needed to transform Sonoco from a packag- ing company that just happens to offer multiple solu- tions to the solutions company our customers desire. In addition, we will continue to consider and explore other opportunities to further strengthen and differ- entiate our organization in the marketplace while returning value to shareholders.
After strengthening our balance sheet by paying down nearly $400 million in debt in 2013, we are focused on further diversifying capital deployment. However, our priorities have not changed. We intend to invest the capital necessary to grow our businesses and improve productivity while maintaining our investment grade credit rating. Furthermore, we expect to continue providing our shareholders with dividends, as we have for more than 88 consecutive years dating back to 1925, which should grow com- mensurate with earnings.
Our first priority for free cash flow remains targeted, bolt-on acquisitions. But we also expect to use free cash flow to buy back shares to reduce dilution. In 2014, we expect to repurchase at least 2 million shares through open market purchases. Our goal going for- ward is to repurchase at least enough shares to offset dilution. Your board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to 5 million shares. Repurchasing shares will allow us to accomplish our near-term plan of lowering the overall share count to approximately 100 million shares.
2014 marks Sonoco’s 115th birthday and our commit- ment to shareholders, customers, employees and the communities where we operate has never been stron- ger. This milestone provides the ideal opportunity for us to reflect on our past and reinforce those beliefs and guiding principles that have brought us this far. But as we all know, success in the past is no guarantee of success in the future. We must look ahead and embrace a new spirit of curiosity, collaboration and innovation, as we re-envision Sonoco as a company that brings more to packaging than just the package. And that will allow us to bring more to our customers and all our stakeholders. I join our more than 19,900 associates around the world in thanking you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your investment.
