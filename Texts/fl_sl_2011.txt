 “THE STRATEGIES OUR TEAM IDENTIFIED AND BEGAN IMPLEMENTING TWO yEARS AGO HAVE ELEVATED OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO NEW HEIGHTS.”
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
In 2011, our Company achieved the highest level of profitability in its history as an athletic footwear and apparel business. We started out two years ago with a vision --- to be the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel --- and we have made tremendous progress towards achieving that vision.
PROGRESS TOWARDS FINANCIAL OBjECTIvES
To guide us towards achieving our vision, our leadership team established several long-term financial objectives at the beginning of 2010. At the time, we saw them as “stretch” targets, but just two years later, we are pleased to report that we not only made substantial progress on each of them, we have already met several of the goals, as shown below:
coming as it did on top of last year’s gain of 5.8 percent. Our gross margin rate also improved significantly, to 31.9 percent from 30.0 percent, while our selling, general, and administrative expenses also improved to a rate of 22.1 percent, down from 22.5 percent in 2010.
STEPS TO ENHANCE SHAREHOLDER RETURNS
Over the last two years, we have focused on sales growth and productivity improvements to enable us to invest
in improving our business. Our strong financial position provides us with the flexibility and confidence to take steps
to enhance shareholder returns, now and in the future. First, we substantially increased our capital expenditure program
in 2011, to $159 million including key money, in order to take advantage of the many new, exciting, and, we believe, profitable opportunities in our business. These investment opportunities include new store growth, redesigned store formats, enhanced Internet and mobile platforms, and technology initiatives to drive efficiency and connect better with our customers across our brand banners, geographies, and channels.
Second, in February 2012, we announced a 9 percent increase in our common stock dividend, on top of the previous year’s 10 percent increase. This latest increase takes effect with the dividend payment in our first quarter of 2012. Finally, we also announced a new three-year $400 million share repurchase program, having repurchased $104 million of our common
stock in 2011. These actions demonstrate our confidence in our ability to maintain a strong, consistent performance.
UPDATED STRATEGIES TO ACHIEvE THE NExT LEvEL OF PERFORMANCE
Last year, I suggested that 2010 would be seen as an inflection point for creating sustained increased value for our shareholders. More than an inflection point, I now believe 2010 actually was a springboard towards a higher level of performance in 2011 and beyond. I say that because, as strong as our performance was in 2011, we continue to learn more about how best to serve our customers, and we have identified additional opportunities that we believe will drive substantial improvements in our results in the years ahead.
In light of our progress over the first two years of our long- range plan, our senior leadership team recently completed a comprehensive review of our strategies and financial objectives. Our vision remains consistent, as do the essential elements
of our strategy. We have, however, made some meaningful enhancements. The pages that follow in this year’s annual

It is clear from these results that the strategies our team identified and began implementing two years ago have proven to be the right ones for our business, and solid execution at every level of the Foot Locker organization has made it possible to elevate our financial and operational performance to new heights.
Other key financial accomplishments in 2011 include earning $1.82 per share, a 68 percent increase over 2010, and the highest level the Company has achieved since becoming Foot Locker, Inc. in 2001. This result was driven by a comparable store sales gain of 9.8 percent, an exceptionally strong result

Given the progress we have made so far toward our original
financial objectives, we have established a new set of long-term financial goals for the period from 2012 through 2016. Overall, we aspire to consistently be a top quartile performer, with:
• Sales of $7.5 billion
• Sales per Gross Square Foot of $500
• Earnings Before Interest and Taxes of 11% of Sales
• Net Income of 7% of Sales
• Return on Invested Capital of 14%
• Inventory Turnover of 3+ times
As I noted, two years ago we believed that the objectives we established then represented “stretch” goals, since some of the goals were set at levels beyond what we had achieved in the past. All of these new goals represent targets well beyond what we have ever achieved before as an athletic company --- we believe this will be the next level of performance in the evolution of our Company. Driven by the initiatives you will see described on the coming pages, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve these targets. The success that we anticipate, though, will not come in a straight line. We will remain focused, and navigate diligently through any setbacks, whether these are the result of challenges in the external environment or due to some element of our own execution. We believe that we have the resources --- our strong team, our core values, our finances,
our market position, and the strong partnerships we have formed with our leading vendors --- to become and remain a top performer, not just in the athletic industry, but in all of retail.

I am also indebted to our Board of Directors, who continue
to provide our management team with guidance and support
both operationally and financially. This spring, James Preston will step down as our lead director and Nicholas DiPaolo will take his place. I want to express to Jim my great appreciation for his years of service as lead director, and his leadership and counsel to me. I am pleased that Jim will remain on our Board. I am also pleased that Nick will be assuming the role of lead director.
His extensive business experience and knowledge of our Company will allow him to add great value as our lead director.
Finally, I am extremely grateful to you, our shareholders.
I have met many of you over the last two years, and I truly appreciate your ongoing confidence and encouragement as we execute our strategies to achieve our vision.
I am convinced that all of the associates at Foot Locker, Inc. look forward to putting into practice the updated strategies and initiatives that we have outlined in this annual report, and continuing on our path to being the leading global retailer of athletically inspired shoes and apparel.
