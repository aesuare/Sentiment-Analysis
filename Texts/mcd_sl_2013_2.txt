Dear Fellow Shareholders:
Amid a still challenging global environment, we continued working to deliver an outstanding experience for our customers. Guided by the Plan to Win and our global growth priorities, our entire System of franchisees, suppliers and employees strived to raise the bar on what drives our success — from our menu and service to our convenience and value.
Your Board of Directors remains con dent in the actions McDonald’s is taking to manage the business for the long term while navigating our near-term challenges. We are equally con dent in the Company’s strong leadership — epitomized by CEO Don Thompson and his global leadership team. Don is a skilled leader who understands this brand and the steps we must take to build an even deeper bond with all of our customers around the world.
We recognize that as the marketplace continues to move quickly, so must our System — by always listening to our customers and continuously adapting to meet their needs. With this charge before us, we are committed to greater innovation, stronger execution and enhancing our restaurant experience.
The future holds great promise and potential for our brand, as we work to seize the still sizeable opportunities around us to be more accessible, more relevant, and ultimately more valuable in the daily lives of our customers. Driven by management’s strong leadership, strategies and our committed employees, we are con dent that McDonald’s will continue to become a stronger, more pro table company over the long term.
McDonald’s Board of diverse, experienced business leaders remains committed to overseeing the Company’s direction and enhancing shareholder value. We embrace our role in helping this great brand continue to succeed — through its long-standing formula of commitment to the customer, hard work and strong values.
On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, it is an honor and privilege to serve you, our shareholders.
Very truly yours,
Andy McKenna
Chairman
