At Baxter International, we serve some of the world’s most chronic and critical health-care needs. It is important work. Important to the patients and health-care professionals who use our products in 112 countries. Important to our employees, who know they are in the business of saving lives. And important to our shareholders, who invest in the opportunity to advance the frontiers of medicine worldwide. Baxter today is executing its strategies of global expansion and technological innovation in four businesses: blood therapies, intravenous (IV) therapy, renal therapy and cardiovascular medicine. These strategies enabled us to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders in 1997, and we are committed to doing so in 1998 and beyond.
Key Accomplishments We made significant progress in 1997. We enhanced our technological superiority by introducing new products like our Amicus™ separator, an automated device that collects blood components, and the Colleague™ infusion pump, which is setting new standards for ease of use and accuracy in IV therapy. We expanded all of our businesses geographically, particularly in Asia and Latin America. And, our research-and-development initiatives made substantial progress in clinical testing. Additionally, several key acquisitions improved both our technology base and our global reach. They included:
?
Immuno International AG, a leading global manufacturer of therapeutic proteins. Baxter’s and Immuno’s strengths—both in terms o f product lines and geographic markets—are extremely complementary, and we believe this will lead to greater gains for our customers and shareh olders.
?
Research Medical, Inc. (RMI), a leader in products used for minimally invasive heart and vascular surgery. The combination expa nds our product offerings in one of the fastest-growing segments of cardiovascular care. 
?
Bieffe Medital S.p.A., a leading dialysis, IV therapy and irrigation solutions business. Bieffe’s flexible non-PVC container te chnology and cost-effective manufacturing processes enable our Renal and I.V. Systems businesses to enter emerging markets more quickly.
Global expansion and technological innovation are the keys to our competitive edge. It’s great to be first, best or biggest in any business. In medical specialties and markets where we operate, Baxter is often all three. That leadership drives growth and enables us to consistently meet our financial commitments to you. 
1997 Financial Commitments
?
Increase sales 20 percent, including acquisitions; or approximately 10 percent excluding acquisitions. Sales grew 16 percent, including acquisitions and before the impact of foreign exchange. Sales rose 6 percent, excluding acquisitions.
?
Grow earnings in the low double digits. Income from continuing operations increased 13 percent, excluding a charge for acquired research and development related to the Immuno and RMI acquisitions.
?
Generate $300 million to $400 million in operational cash flow before litigation payments, after investing approximately $1 bil lion for capital improvements and research and development. Baxter generated $432 million in operational cash flow before litigation payments, after spending $392 million in research and development and $496 million in capital expenditures.
Overall, total return to shareholders (including reinvested dividends) for 1997 increased 26 percent. This was greater than the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P Medical Products and Supplies Index. We also increased the dividend for the 41st consecutive year.
Contributing to this performance is our practice of directly aligning management’s financial incentives with your interest as shareholders, through stockpurchase programs, stock options and bonus plans based both on the achievement of our financial commitments and on stock-price appreciation. Your board of directors also is compensated primarily in Baxter stock. 
Our financial goals for 1998 are equally specific and ambitious. We expect to:
?
Increase sales approximately 10 percent, before acquisitions and the impact of foreign exchange.
?
Grow earnings in the mid-teens, before the impact of foreign exchange, and in the low double digits after absorbing the impact of foreign exchange.
?
Generate at least $500 million in operational cash flow. This will be after investing approximately $1 billion in capital impro vements and research and development.
We intend to achieve our goals in 1998 and beyond by building on our strengths and sticking to our strategies.
Strategies and Strengths Our strategy of technological innovation stretches back through a long line of firsts: first flexible, plastic container for IV fluids; first artificial kidney machine; first implantable heart valve; first Factor VIII clotting concentrate to treat hemophilia, and many more. Today, Baxter’s businesses are all based on expertise related to the blood and circulatory system. What’s more, they share basic technologies. Our Blood Therapies, I.V. Systems and Renal businesses all use disposable plastic containers to deliver solutions. All four businesses rely on sophisticated instrumentation to control everything from IV pumps to heart-lung machines.
To make the most of the strengths we share, and to encourage ongoing innovation, Baxter’s Technical Council brings together top scientists from throughout the company. We operate three corporate research centers in the United States, Belgium and Japan. We also maintain vast scientific databases that are available to all our businesses worldwide.
Despite this expertise, we have aggressively built on our internal strengths by accessing technology developed elsewhere. We have expanded our product portfolio in recent years by licensing and buying technology, acquiring companies and entering into joint ventures. This is one way we keep a new stream of ideas flowing into the company to complement our existing base of knowledge.
During 1997, we continued to advance our clinical trials, several of which are testing products that represent breakthroughs in medicine. We became the first company to begin Phase III clinical trials in trauma patients with a hemoglobin therapeutic, or “blood substitute.” Called HemAssist™ (Hemoglobin Crosfumaril), this hemoglobin-derived solution is being tested for its ability to deliver oxygen to patients’ vital organs, potentially reducing complications or saving the lives of patients with significant blood loss. We expect to bring this product to market in late 1999 or early 2000. 
We also are pursuing potential breakthroughs in xenotransplantation, or animal-to-human transplants. Baxter added several sites to its clinical trial that uses transgenic pig livers as an extracorporeal (outside the body) perfusion device as a bridge to transplant for patients suffering from acute liver failure. We hope to complete this trial within the next year. Other trials, such as those for our Novacor® left-ventricular assist device, used to support patients with failing hearts; and for a pulmonary medication-delivery device, which potentially will deliver medication to patients’ lungs more efficiently, are progressing well.

BAXTER INTERNATIONAL 1997 ANNUAL REPORT
Besides being technologically adept, we also are committed to a strategy of global expansion. Our approach is market-by-market, developing and adapting products and services for the specific state of each market’s medical system and economic infrastructure. We listen intently to our customers around the world, then design and deliver products and services that meet their requirements. That’s what it means to be a truly global company.
These twin strategies of technological innovation and global expansion have proven very successful. Today, products that hold No. 1 market positions—many of which we were the first to introduce—account for about 70 percent of sales. Thirty-six percent of our sales are from products introduced within the last five years. At the same time, more than 50 percent of sales, and 75 percent of earnings, come from outside the United States.
Elsewhere in this report, sections on our core capabilities and individual businesses explain how we will pursue these strategies in 1998 and beyond.
?
Our Blood Therapies businesses will build on the Immuno acquisition to expand in Europe and elsewhere. They also will continue clinical trials for our hemoglobin therapeutic in the United States and Europe, and for our pathogen-inactivation technologies.
?
Our I.V. Systems/Medical Products business will aggressively market its new Colleague™ pump worldwide, while using technology a cquired from Bieffe to complement and expand its geographic base.
?
Our Renal business will expand peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis therapies into developed and emerging markets. It also will continue to expand its two service businesses: Renal Therapy Services, which operates dialysis clinics overseas, and Renal Management Strategies Inc., a disease-management organization focused on the U.S. market.
?
Our CardioVascular business will build on its leadership in heart-valve therapy, as well as pursue opportunities in minimally i nvasive surgery and other developing treatments for late-stage cardiovascular disease.
Employees and Community Behind all these plans and strategies stand the people of Baxter. Our employees are exceptionally dedicated. They work here not just to make a living, but also to make a difference. To them, we pledge continued opportunity, support and respect. In 1997, we also reinforced our commitment to communities around the globe where we live and work. Through direct donations, including disaster relief, and through our support of The Baxter Allegiance Foundation, we worked to improve the availability and affordability of health care from Düsseldorf, Germany, to Cali, Colombia. It is a commitment that draws on our business skills as well as the caring and dedication of Baxter people everywhere.
At Baxter, we are driven and inspired by our strategies of technological innovation and global expansion; by the chance to save lives and alleviate suffering worldwide; by the opportunity to provide a challenging and rewarding work environment for our employees; and by the responsibility to generate outstanding returns for our shareholders. During 1998, we have the opportunity, and the obligation, to achieve those goals once again. We will meet the challenge.
On behalf of the entire Baxter team,
Vernon R. Loucks Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer February 13, 1998
