TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS








Caterpillar people are relentless.
Case in point: we entered 2006 celebrating the best year in our company's history. Sales and revenues were up 20 percent. Earnings were up 40 percent. Explosive growth was the norm across almost all our businesses. How did our people respond to the successes  of  2005? By immediately  going back to work to make 2006 and beyond even better-identifying opportunities and staking out aggressive improvement plans to drive success.

200 6 marked a goo d start on our Journey. It was our fourth str aight year of double-digit prof it growth and our third consecutive year of record sales and profitability. We too k advantage of our financial success- including strong cash flow- to fun d growth in capacity, continue aggressive new product development, complete the strategic acquisition of Progress Rail, increase the dividend rate by 20 percent and buy back more than $3  billion in stock. All these actions will deliver long-t erm benefit s for our customers, employees and investors.
We feel good about our performance, not just in 2006 but over the past several years. Since 1990, our sales and revenues have grown from just over $11 billion to $4 1.5 billion in 2006, a com­pound annual growth rate of 8 percent. Profit per share is up significantly as w ell, reaching $ 5.17 in 2006. Over the past five years, Caterpillar' s compound annual profit per share growth is 3 5 percent-  compared to 2 7 percent for the S&P 500.
Lookin g ahead, we're well-positioned to deliver similar results through the end of the decade. Our pro duct line up is the strongest in our history. We've add ed capacity to meet demand and continue
 
to invest in new products, technologies and services. The near-term outlook is strong in many key industries we serve: mining, oil and gas production, large infrastructure proJects, non-residential con­struction, marine engines and distributed pow er. We expect two pockets of market weakness in 200 7 in the Unit ed Stat es. First, the on-highway truck engine business will drop significantly as new emissions regulations take effect. Second, housing -related sectors will be dow n after several years of rapid growth. Given the diversity of our business, however, we're projecting another record  year in 2007. Sales and revenues should be in the $4 1 5 to $43.6 billion range, with prof it per share of $5.20 to $5.70 - an d we have a good line of sight to our 201O sales and revenues goal of $50+ billion.
Our  focus now  is  on execution- relentless execution of  the
strategy we unveiled to all employees in late 200 5 an d to our  worldwide dealers and strategic suppliers in earl y 2006. This strategy clearly articulates our bold goals in the areas of people, product and process performance and profitable growth.  Achieving it w ill require breakthrough changes in several areas of our business.

A NEVER-ENDING FOCUS ON SAFETY AND ENGAGEMENT
In 2000, we examined our enterprise safety performance and were disappointed to discover how far we were from our goal of an inJury­ free workplace One injured employee is one too many-and our performance six years ago was unacceptable. But bringing our poor safety numbers to light has led to significant changes in our physical work environment and our culture. Today, our people know that nothing, not production or profits, is more important than safety. We've made safety excellence the highest priority for our leaders. And we've set the expectation that each of us has a personal responsibility to improve our own health and safety and that of our coworkers.
The results are encouraging. Recordable injuries have dropped by 66 percent since 2000. In 2006, 548 fewer people were inJured on the job than in 2005-despite working 18 million more hours. More than 50 facilities ended the year without a single record­  able injury. And 87 facilities-representing approximately 23,500 employees-have achieved world-class safety performance. Their success is proof that we can reach our ultimate goal of zero injuries as a company. But we still have much work to do. We're upping our investment in training, increasing our focus on ergonomics to address the "strains and sprains" that comprise a significant portion of our injuries and deploying Vision Zero-our uniform, standardized safety process-across the company.
Making safety our top priority is really about putting people first,
and we're making positive strides in this area. Employee engage­ment is how we measure our people's commitment, work  effort and desire to stay at Caterpillar. In 2002, Just three of our divisions had engagement scores higher than 70 percent. Today, 17 divi­ sions-comprising more than 31,000 employees-do,  and  eight have topped  80  percent. To reach  our  201O goal of  90 percent
engagement  company-wide, we'll continue to focus on building
the values-based culture described in Our Values rn Action, the update to our Worldwide Code of Conduct published in 2005.
 

A CONSTANT PUSH FOR HIGHER LEVELS OF QUALITY AND VELOCITY
Delivering the highest quality products when and where customers need them has been the hallmark of Caterpillar's success for more than 80 years But we can't rest on our reputation Exploding demand and supply constraints have caused us to hit a plateau in product quality. And our velocity performance-our ability to serve customers better and faster with less inventory tied up in the supply chain-also needs improvement. Our customers don't want excuses; they want and deserve excellence. We're committed to achieving the high levels of performance they demand.
In late 2006, we established a corporate product quality organization to help drive common processes, metrics and sim­plification across our diverse organization, with 6 Sigma at the foundation. Time and again, our people-using 6 Sigma meth­odology-have found solutions to tough problems, and we're confident that refocusing our 6 Sigma human resources on quality will deliver the results we need. We've also merged three of our largest U.S. facilities-Aurora, Decatur and East Peoria, Illinois-into one organization and restructured three product-focused divisions into two industry-focused divisions. These organizational shifts will enable us to share technology and processes, build consistency among products and create closer connections with customers­ leading to higher quality, improved velocity and lower product development costs.

AN UNRELENTING QUEST TO GET BETTER
Ultimately, we believe the Caterpillar Production System holds the key to breakthrough improvement in safety, quality, velocity and cost. In 2007, our focus is on worldwide deployment. Each of our facilities will implement an operating system that eliminates waste, a cultural system that improves the way we work together and a management system that creates measurements and structure to support continuous improvement. The Caterpillar Production System is the driving force behind our efforts to produce the highest quality
