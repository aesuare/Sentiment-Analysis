2010 marked another year of record growth for Tractor Supply Company as we began the new decade with great momentum. We increased our revenue nearly 14 percent to $3.64 billion and grew net income 40 percent to $168.0 million, or $2.25 per diluted share 1. These results reflect a 7 percent same-store sales increase, store growth of approximately 8 percent, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.

Tractor Supply Company is the largest operator of retail farm and ranch stores in the United States. Much of our success is because we have followed the road map provided by our Retail Engine [pictured above]. Our company works under an overarching commitment to Values, Ethics, Trust, Risk Taking, Collaboration, Hard Work and Passion. This is who we are, what we do and how we do it.

The first of the four flywheels is Team Member Loyalty. We hire hard and we hire great people. We want to teach and develop our team, acknowledge them for the things they do well and retain them over a long period so that everyone learns more. Our manager turnover and hourly team member turnover were at record lows in 2010. Our team's foresight, experience and cross-functional collaboration have enabled us to plan effectively and to execute efficiently.

We believe in developing Loyal Customers because we know that truly loyal customers become more valuable to us over time, and this is the focus of our second flywheel. These customers shop our stores more frequently, they refer their friends and relatives more often and they buy our private label products more consistently because they trust our brands. We are passionate about supporting the rural lifestyle. We have a deep understanding of our customers' needs and we continue to refine our products and stores accordingly. As a result, Tractor Supply Company has become a meaningful part of their everyday lives. The Customer Flywheel is spinning, and our customer loyalty scores are high and growing. Throughout the recession, we leveraged our knowledge and anticipated that our customers would continue to shop on a needs- and value-driven basis. However, we knew that their focus on high-quality merchandise would remain unchanged. We increased our commitment to core consumable, usable and edible (C.U.E.) products, which are the basic items our customers use most frequently. In 2010, C.U.E. merchandise continued to be a key sales driver and traffic generator. In particular, we increased sales of national brand large animal feeds and launched a new private pet food brand, 4health. Our multi-year strategy to grow the animal and pet business continued to produce results in 2010. This category represented 39 percent of our 2010 sales compared to 33 percent in 2007. At the same time, we have continued our highly disciplined approach to our marketing program. We once again improved the efficiency of our print and direct marketing programs. Through enhanced customer relationship management (CRM) and customer segmentation, we continue to develop our capability to market to the right household with the right product and promotion. These marketing enhancements contributed to the increase in our transaction count in 2010 and our increase in gross margin dollars net of advertising spend.

We also believe in Vendor Loyalty. Loyal vendors develop a relationship that is profitable for both the vendor and Tractor Supply Company. Through long-term partnerships, loyal vendors deliver high-quality goods at low costs.

We recognize the importance of anticipating our customers' interests and we work with our vendors to ensure we are offering the right products at the right time in the right location. Our inventory management and execution is simply the best that it has ever been. We reduced the dependency on certain big-ticket, more discretionary products and expanded our focus to the top 300 SKUs within the top 30 categories in 2010. We maintained solid in-stock positions throughout 2010, entered each season very well-stocked, managed our markdown cadence effectively, and exited seasons cleanly. We also achieved record inventory turnover of 3.1 times compared to 2.9 times in 2009--the first time in the Company's history that we exceeded three turns.

We believe that the foundation of our successes is Low Cost and Efficiency. Our commitment to this foundation supports everything we do. The Tractor Value System, which is our continuous improvement program, is now an integral part of our culture and our team members have become relentless about eliminating waste and reducing cost. In 2010, we once again made progress on our goals to operate as a lean, efficient organization as we achieved great outcomes while applying the minimum steps and capital to get the job done. During 2010, we also benefited from technology enhancements as we completed rolling out our point-of-sale system and upgrading our enterprise resource planning system. We have begun to move forward on our price optimization program with a more systemic approach, and we expect to benefit from this implementation in the second half of 2011. We are also adding automation to our distribution network with a warehouse management system and conveyors to help drive further efficiencies.

All of these accomplishments helped us to generate broad-based strength across the business and drive shareholder value. Our final flywheel is Shareholder Loyalty. We want to have shareholders who take a long-term view,

who are patient and allow our strategies to become fully implemented to produce great and sustainable results over time. In turn, we believe this enables us to deliver the best long-term shareholder value. In 2010, we initiated a quarterly cash dividend program and continued our share repurchasing program. These actions in addition to our September 2010 2-for-1 stock split have benefited our shareholders and increased the attractiveness of our stock to a broader range of investors.

Our track record of success and relentless dissatisfaction with the status quo has provided us with confidence that we will continue to achieve exceptional results and deliver shareholder value. Throughout the past several years, we have benefited from our Retail Engine and we believe that the consistency of our results reinforce that our performance is sustainable. We have used a balanced approach to grow and improve our business. This strategy has produced compounded annual growth rates of 17% for sales and 26% for earnings over the past 10 years. At the same time, we intend to leverage the strength of our balance sheet to continue investing in the business and returning value to shareholders. Tractor Supply Company would not be the outstanding company that it is today without the loyal support of our team members, customers, vendors and shareholders. We appreciate the relationships we have built with all of our stakeholders and the powerful Retail Engine that we have created together. Our company is running on all cylinders. We have a lot to celebrate and even more to achieve as we look forward to 2011 and the years ahead.
