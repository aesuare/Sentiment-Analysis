 To Our Shareholders
  
 The past year was a time of dramatic change in the energy industry.Your company, Con Edison, was on the move, meeting the challenges of an evolving in- dustry, with a firm foundation of leadership and financial strength, and a focus on enhancing share- holder value.
The fundamentals of our business – the character- istics that have made us one of the largest and most suc- cessful energy companies in the nation – remain strong.
Dividends and Earnings
We increased our annual dividend per share in 2000 from $2.14 to $2.18, and we raised it again in January 2001, to an annualized $2.20. This is the twenty-seventh consecutive year that we’ve increased the dividend – that’s more than a quarter century of steady growth, a record among the best in the utility industry.The common stock price for the year rose 11.6 percent, and total return to shareholders (which includes dividends) was 19.1 percent.
In 2000, our earnings per share from ongoing operations were $3.24, a rise of 10 cents over last year. Reported earnings were $2.75 a share, reflecting non- recurring charges of approximately $0.40 a share for the possible disallowance of replacement power costs for our nuclear plant, which returned to service in January 2001, and $0.09 a share for merger-related expenses.
Powering Economic Expansion
We’ve been on the move in recent years, helping to power our service area’s strong economic growth. Job expansion continues at a strong pace. In 2000, New York City’s employment base grew by 2.9 percent, the second year in a row that local job growth exceeded that of the country as a whole. More jobs mean greater demand for our electric, gas and steam services.
Furthermore, the information revolution has not only expanded but has also reshaped our service area’s
economy. Computer-based technologies have fun- damentally changed how people work and live, and the resulting new demands for energy from these new technologies have also meant improving sales for Con Edison’s energy delivery business. To put this in perspective, in the 1960s, the Empire State Building had power needs of about five to six watts per square foot. A new high-tech office building of the late 90s has power needs ranging from eight to 12 watts per square foot.
Over the past two years, Con Edison’s electric energy sales increased by more than three percent a year, after adjustment to normal weather con- ditions.This is the highest rate of growth we’ve seen in 10 years.
As computer and technology businesses with real value continue to thrive, they rely on Con Edison for the energy they need to grow. In the past decade, we helped the NewYork Stock Exchange modernize its trading floors, allowing for more advanced com- puterized trading. Now we’re helping telecom- munications and high-tech companies address their unprecedented power needs, once again con- tributing to both economic growth and expansion of our company’s business.
Virtually every home and business in our service area today is looking to power electronic and tele- communications equipment and appliances that didn’t even exist just a few years ago.These new tools have now been integrated into the way we do busi- ness and will be part of our business lives in the years to come.
Companies that rely on computers and other sensitive electronic equipment demand the highest possible levels of electric service reliability. Con Edison provides its customers with the most reliable electric service in the country, as our electric distribution system’s performance in 2000 reaffirmed. As the demand for our service increases, we’re expanding and reinforcing our delivery facilities.We’ll

 be investing $2.4 billion in our electric transmission and distribution infrastructures over the next five years – $483 million in 2001 alone.
Measured Transition to a New Industry Structure
We’ve been working with regulators, legislators and other important constituents to continue the deliberate transition to a competitive energy en- vironment in New York. This process has taken place in measured steps over the past five years and will continue to evolve over the next several years.
As a result of events in California, the nation’s attention is now drawn to the dynamics of energy supply. In New York State, the emphasis has been on creating deregulated wholesale and retail market- places. We view the increased national focus on energy issues as an opportunity to expand the important dialogue among all interested parties in this critical period in our industry’s and in your company’s transformation, and we’ve acted accord- ingly to promote the exchange of information, ideas and solutions.
We believe competitive energy markets have the long-term potential to be good for our customers and for our company’s growth, and we have supported their development in New York State. Important challenges remain before these markets can operate with the liquidity and efficiency that are necessary for true competition, and we are helping to address these challenges.
Under our restructuring plan, we sold most of our power plants.We now buy the energy we deliver to our full-service customers. Over the past year, several forces have led to higher and more volatile prices for this energy.These include sharp increases in the cost of the fuels used to produce electricity, energy demand that has grown faster than energy supply, and start-up problems in the new wholesale energy marketplace.
including regulators, legislators, customers, investors, our partners in the community, and the media – we stress the need for new generation sources to ensure an adequate supply and to enable a fair and efficient competitive market to develop. In addition, we have taken a lead role in urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and New York’s In- dependent System Operator to implement substantial reforms in the emerging wholesale market in order to promote efficient pricing.
An important factor in the successful transition to a competitive market in New York is the fact that, unlike the model in some other states, our customers pay the actual cost of the energy they use. This encourages both more competitive offerings from unregulated energy suppliers, and greater energy conservation by customers when prices rise.
As competitive energy markets in New York develop, Con Edison’s core business and financial strength remain secure.
O&R Acquisition Generating
Revenues and Efficiencies
In its first full year as a Con Edison company, Orange and Rockland Utilities (O&R) contributed impor- tantly to the company’s growth. Headquartered in Pearl River, New York, and contiguous to Con Edison’s existing service area, O&R and its

 subsidiaries serve a population of about 700,000 in seven counties in New York, northern New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania. Earnings for 2000 were $39.1 million, contributing $0.18 per share to Con Edison’s overall performance.
The acquisition has also meant improved efficiencies and operational value for Con Edison. We’ve seen positive benefits for both shareholders and customers through the consolidation of major functions like payment processing, information resources, legal services and materials testing. We’ve also strengthened our purchasing power by com- bining large-scale, common requirements like gas transportation contracts and general office supplies.
We’ve integrated our storm response system with O&R’s, which means that more crews, equipment and support are available to respond to emergen- cies and restore service throughout our combined service areas.

Our experience to date makes us confident that we can continue to increase the benefits of this strategic merger in the coming years.
Putting Our Shareholders First
In October 1999, we announced an agreement to acquire Northeast Utilities (NU), a large neighboring utility. Earlier this year, after thorough analysis and deliberation, we concluded that Northeast Utilities had not met several conditions to the merger, and that unless those conditions were satisfied we would not go forward with the merger at the price set forth in the agreement. NU has filed a lawsuit against us for failing to commit to the merger. We believe the lawsuit is without merit and we are vigorously opposing it.
The strategy that initiated this merger and our O&R merger remains sound: We will continue to grow our core business, the transmission and distribution of energy, and our related unregulated ventures.We will also continue to consider geographic expansion of our regulated business. And, we will continue to act with discipline and focus.We have said that we would not pursue a merger that was not good for our shareholders, and we remain steadfast on that point.
Bringing About Positive Change
Throughout Con Edison, 2000 was a year of positive change. Furthering our strategy of focusing on the energy delivery business, we signed a contract for the sale of our Indian Point nuclear facilities to the Entergy Corporation for approximately $602 million.
In another positive development, we’re proceeding with plans to repower the East River Station. Repowering will help us to stabilize steam rates and maintain reliability through the installation of new state-of-the-art equipment. The improvements will produce environmental benefits and increase power

 output, providing an additional 200 megawatts of much-needed electric supply in NewYork City.
In November 2000, we entered into a contract to sell several Con Edison properties along First Avenue in Manhattan, between 35th and 41st Streets. The sale involves a total of approximately nine acres.The purchase price for all the properties is expected to be between $576 and $680 million, depending on zoning.The transaction will benefit shareholders and customers alike by ensuring the recovery of past investments related to our steam system.The sale of the properties is pending approval by the Public Service Commission.
Gas and Steam Business Highlights
Con Edison’s natural gas business grew in 2000, achieving increases over 1999 in firm sales and transportation, and operating income. We ex- perienced our all-time peak demand on January 17, 2000 – almost 1.2 million dekatherms, enough gas to heat 10,000 homes for an entire winter season.The system performed well, and our surveys indicated that customer satisfaction reached its highest level, averaging 92.9 percent for the year.
The company’s steam business unit also fared well in 2000, and its superior performance was recognized with the System of the Year award from the International District Energy Association.The award cited the system’s efficiency, reliability and availability, as well as its environmental benefits.
Competitive Businesses
In the year 2000, our four unregulated companies were also on the move. Con Edison Com- munications entered the New York City fiber-optic transport market when it was awarded a franchise to provide transport services throughout the five boroughs. Con Edison Communications will provide wholesale, carrier-grade fiber-optic services that provide “last-mile” connectivity, enabling telecom-
munications carriers and Internet service providers to span the distance between their own networks and individual buildings, and allowing them to reach new customers.
Our program to install more than 112,000 fiber- strand miles by the end of 2005 is under way. It will involve connecting more than 1,000 buildings and bringing our network within one-and-one-half blocks of most buildings in Manhattan.We’re working hard to ensure that this extensive telecommunications network will be more efficient, reliable and flexible than any other network in our service area.
Con Edison Development, a second competitive business, develops and acquires generation assets. In 2000, the company began building a 525-megawatt natural-gas-fired power plant in Newington, New Hampshire. This plant will use modern combustion turbines and heat recovery steam generators, ensuring much higher efficiency and significantly lower emissions than traditional plants. The plant has been welcomed by the community and local officials, and will help satisfy growing energy needs, bolster the local economy and contribute to a competitive energy environment in New England. Another competitive enterprise, Con Edison Energy, offers energy, capacity and risk-management services to wholesale customers in the Northeast.
Our energy services company, Con Edison Solutions, is a major player in the competitive retail energy sales market in our service area and neighboring states. Solutions also provides related energy products and services and customized solutions to customers’ energy needs.
Each of these businesses builds on our proven expertise and experience, and we look forward to substantial growth in these markets in the years to come.
