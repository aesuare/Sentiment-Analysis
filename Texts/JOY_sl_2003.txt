To Our Shareholders
Fiscal 2003 was a tough but rewarding year. Fiscal 2002 started with a very strong U. S. coal market that quickly fizzled and led to sharp declines in revenue in the second half of the year and early 2003. The management team in fiscal 2003 had to overcome weak markets globally, the orientation of two new company presidents, reorganization of Joy Mining, major rationalization projects in both businesses and significant increases in benefit costs and variable, performance based compensation. Nonetheless we achieved respectable earnings, improved working capital utilization, invested in aftermarket infrastructure, generated strong cash flows, paid down debt, bought out our minority partner in Australia, and prefunded our defined benefit pension plans. Then with two full post emergence years behind us, with our balance sheet in good shape and with solid prospects for continued growth in free cash flow, we initiated a cash dividend. Our achievements did not go unnoticed by investors. Joy Global significantly outperformed all major stock market indices in 2003. We know that this was due, in part, to improving equity markets and a preference by some investors for cyclical stocks. So we can't take all the credit! But we do think we have been doing many of the right things... managing our cyclical business with financial conservatism as an operating company, improving performance ratios, increasing transparency and enhancing our investor communications. Earnings improved dramatically in fiscal 2003 in spite of the modest 6% growth in revenues. In part the improvement resulted from the elimination of last year's $54 million of fresh-start inventory charges. But, excluding these charges, operating metrics improved measurably in fiscal 2003. Best of all, we had a strong fourth quarter driven by aftermarket activity and a 38% increase in revenue from the prior year. Earnings per share of $0.30 for the quarter was a significant increase over the $0.12 per share in the same quarter last year. Our total emerging market's revenues grew at a faster pace in 2003 than our established markets in spite of no growth in China year to year. Yet China remains a very attractive market with greater potential for revenue growth than all the other emerging markets combined. We have consolidated assets in some areas over the past year, but we also invested across a number of fronts. The service center in Baotou, Inner Mongolia is just the most recent example of the continuing upgrading of our infrastructure. A new facility in the oil sands and expansions in Chile and the Powder River Basin add capabilities in regions that are growing. Other efforts also included the upgrade of a number of U. S. underground mining service centers as part of the rationalization program completed during fiscal 2003. Our Strategic Sourcing Initiative, new product development and introduction, cycle time reductions and other cost reduction initiatives are critical to maintaining our high customer service levels worldwide while achieving positive operating results throughout the business cycle. We have continued our focus on cash flow generation, improving the overall capital structure and creating shareholder value with the appropriate use of free cash. Cash balances improved dramatically during the year and totaled almost $150 million at year-end as compared to $70 million at the beginning of the year. This increase was in spite of voluntary contributions to our pension plans of $40 million and $25 million of cash used to acquire the minority interest in an Australian subsidiary and an early repayment of industrial revenue bonds. Our strong cash performance resulted in substantial improvements in net debt, liquidity, and other credit related measures, including an upgrade in outlook from Moody's late in the year. I look forward to 2004. It is far more productive to operate in markets that are strengthening than those that are struggling... even though we have implemented strategies to be profitable in both. Our objectives are to continue to drive our strategies for growth, improve utilization of working capital, increase our flexibility to return cash to shareholders, create a high performance work environment and improve service levels to our global customer base... and always keep our focus on our Life Cycle Management Strategies in both businesses. The significant achievements of fiscal 2003 and anticipated continued accomplishments in fiscal 2004 and beyond would not be possible without the continued support of our employees, suppliers, customers and shareholders. We are committed to continuing to earn this support.
