Dear customers, employees anD shareholDers,
While 2008 was a challenging year for Nordstrom, we made a number of positive strides and believe the company is well positioned in the marketplace with stores in the best locations across the country. Despite the tough climate, we continued to execute our long-term strategy by staying focused on the quality of our customers’ shopping experience, both in our stores and online. Our optimism for growing the company and our multi-channel capabilities remains strong as we continue to strive to gain market share with customers. Throughout the year ahead, we remain committed to a superior customer experience and merchandise offering while continuing our focus on operating an efficient and profitable business.
Eighteen months ago, in fall 2007, we experienced a softening in our top-line sales, causing inventories to outpace our sales. As a management team, we took steps to get our inventories and expenses aligned with our projected sales. We developed alternative plans based on various scenarios to ensure we could react quickly to changing conditions. These steps put the company on solid footing in 2008 and positioned us to respond quickly to the precipitous drop in the economy last October. As market circumstances changed, we responded by realigning inventories and reducing both expenses and capital expenditures once again, which enabled us to manage the business effectively.
Let’s review 2008 results, which contained a few bright spots:
• Sales — Our original plan was flat to negative low single digit same-store sales, which was realistic at the beginning of the year. Market conditions changed and we ended the year with a total sales decrease of 6.3% to $8.3 billion, and a same-store sales decrease of 9.0%.
• SG&A — We cut selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $130 million, excluding incremental expenses related to bad debt and new stores. We will continue to rigorously manage expenses while maintaining our focus on the customer’s experience at point of sale.
• Earnings — Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were $779 million, a 37% decrease compared to last year’s EBIT of $1.2 billion.
• Full-line Stores — We opened eight stores in 2008. Our full-line stores experienced a 12.4% same-store sales decrease. While sales were down, our year-end inventory per square foot was aligned with sales, down 12% compared with last year.
• Nordstrom Rack — We opened six Nordstrom Racks in 2008. Our Rack division once again had an outstanding year, achieving a 3.1% same-store sales increase and providing a secondary sales outlet to keep our Nordstrom store inventories fresh.
• Nordstrom Direct — Net sales increased 8.4% in Nordstrom Direct, our online and catalog business. This indicates that many of our customers want to be served through multiple channels and our ability to do this well is contributing to sales growth for the company.
While we certainly weren’t satisfied with the overall results, we positioned ourselves well from a financial standpoint to begin the new year and lay groundwork for the future. As we move into 2009, business is and will continue to be challenging. While we don’t know how long the current economic downturn will last, we do have a solid strategy in place to navigate these difficult times. We’ve made great strides to ensure that every dollar spent is meaningful to the customer experience — and we continue to challenge activities that are not. Our strategy addresses four key efforts:
• Strive to improve our customers’ service experience.
• Continue to evolve our merchandise offering to meet the changing needs of our customers.
• Deepen the personal relationships with our customers through our multi-channel shopping experience and Nordstrom Fashion Rewards® program.
• Manage the business effectively through an unpredictable environment and emerge stronger.

The cornerstone of our strategy is customer service. Deepening customer relationships is a simple notion that can be hard to master and there is literally no finish line — we can always work to improve. For us to be effective we need to continue doing all we can to serve each customer properly. The relationship our salespeople have with each customer is the heart and soul of our customer service. Our goal is to give our salespeople the tools and freedom they need to develop those relationships. One such vehicle is Personal Book, a dynamic tool at the register that allows salespeople to build and strengthen customer relationships. Among its many features, Personal Book enables salespeople to focus on customer preferences, so they can be more proactive in serving each customer and driving their business.
Second, our merchants continue to adjust inventory levels with a keen eye to brands and price points our customers want. We know customers still desire quality and newness in fashion, yet they are more deliberate with their purchases and place a higher priority on value. Our long-standing tradition of ensuring we have integrity in our pricing, every day of the year, is especially relevant today. We are proud of our buyers’ heightened efforts to seek out the best values in the marketplace and to continue to pursue new trends and hot items. We have also done a better job of utilizing Direct-to-Customer shipping, or DTCs, which enables salespeople to meet customer demand in our stores by accessing inventory company-wide.
A third focus of our strategy is to deepen customer relationships through our multi-channel shopping experience and our Nordstrom Fashion Rewards® program. We made substantial strides toward a seamless multi-channel shopping experience in 2008 by adding a new convenience called ‘Buy Online, Pick Up In Store.’ This service enables customers to buy items online, then pick them up at one of our stores, usually within one hour. Our customers responded well to this convenience and many customers utilized it during the holidays. In addition, we continued to evolve Nordstrom Fashion Rewards, our customer loyalty program. Customers who utilize this program continue to outspend customers not taking advantage of Nordstrom Rewards.
The fourth point of our strategy involves managing our business effectively during this challenging economy. We have made tough decisions in the past year to scale back expenditures where necessary without compromising our approach to customer service. We cut selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $130 million, excluding incremental expenses related to bad debt and new stores. We also plan to reduce major store remodels from six per year to two and have postponed several new store openings. We have not cut maintenance capital because it’s important that we maintain the look, feel and experience of shopping in our stores. We expect our actions in 2009 related to inventory, expenses, working capital and capital expenditures will allow us to generate positive free cash flow this year and position the company well when the economy recovers.
Our operating margins and low debt ratio put us in the top tier of our industry. We also see benefit in our investment-grade credit ratings which rank higher than the majority of our peers. In addition, we have $950 million in short-term borrowing facilities, which provides flexibility in managing our business.
We are particularly proud of the over 50,000 Nordstrom employees who are working hard to make business happen. Even in a down economy, we have numerous examples of salespeople exceeding their goals, and going above and beyond to better serve the customer. It’s especially important for our people to know that the company values their efforts, welcomes their input and trusts in their ability to make a difference with our customers. If we work collectively as a team, our entrepreneurial spirit and culture of service will help us realize the goals before us. When our salespeople think of Nordstrom as their own business, it’s amazing what they can accomplish.
Finally, we are encouraged by the feedback we receive from our customers. We know there are many places where people can shop, so we are especially grateful that they continue to choose Nordstrom.
For us to be effective, we need to continue doing all we can to serve each customer well and find ways to drive top-line sales. We have many bright spots in our business that reaffirm for all of us that we have the right foundation and principles.
On behalf of everyone at Nordstrom, thank you for your continued support. Sincerely,
Blake W. Nordstrom President, Nordstrom, Inc.
