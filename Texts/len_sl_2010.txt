                Letter to our Shareholders
Stuart A. Miller
President and Chief Executive Officer Lennar Corporation
 Dear Shareholders:
Fiscal 2010 was a year of improved performance for Lennar against a backdrop of a very difficult homebuilding and economic environment. It was a year that started with signs of stabilization and high hopes that the tax credit together with historically low interest rates would help form a foundation on which the housing market might form a comeback. Unfortunately, as the tax credit expired, it became clear that it had only helped pull existing demand forward and that low interest rates alone would not be enough to sustain higher demand levels and overcome high unemployment, low consumer confidence and the customer’s general inability to secure funds for a down payment.
Despite the difficult environment, we have remained focused on our balance sheet and are very pleased that our fiscal 2010 results represent a return to profitability. The following are some fiscal 2010 operating results for our Company:
• Revenues of $3.1 billion – down 1%
• Net earnings of $95.3 million, or $0.51 per diluted
share, compared to a net loss of $417.1 million, or
$2.45 per diluted share in 2009
• Homebuilding operating earnings of $100.1 million
• Deliveries of 10,955 homes – down 5%
• New orders of 10,928 homes – down 5%
• $1.2 billion of homebuilding cash and a
homebuilding debt to total capital position, net of
homebuilding cash, of 42.4%
• Financial services operating earnings of $31.3
million
• Rialto Investments operating earnings of $57.3
million (which included $33.2 million of net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests)
We are pleased with the progress we’ve been able to make in fiscal 2010 and are excited that we remain positioned to sustain our profitability despite today’s economic environment. In addition, we are driven to materially improve profitability as the market stabilizes and ultimately recovers.
Our homebuilding operations have been engaged in a year of blocking and tackling, as we focused on maximizing operational efficiency in order to achieve profitability even in today’s market conditions. We have made continued progress by:
• Value engineering and maximizing efficiency with new product offerings targeted to today’s buyers
• Reducing our cycle times
• Reducing the number of floor plans offered for sale • Renegotiating costs and reducing our direct costs by
an average of 25% since the peak
• Improving our pre-impairment homebuilding gross
margin to 21.4% versus 15.6% in the prior year
• Managing our inventory by matching our starts to sales and using below market financing and
incentives to sell homes and minimize inventory
• Right-sizing our operations with the appropriate level of personnel for today’s market conditions
• Being selective to purchase land only in communities
that will drive our gross margins upward and avoiding competitive bid situations that can result in driving land prices over market
Additionally, during the second half of fiscal 2010, we reignited our Everything’s Included marketing platform in order to ensure that our homes always offer the very best value proposition in our markets. This platform has been successful in offering the best value by targeting the options and upgrades that are most desirable to our customers, and simply including them, while eliminating options and upgrades and the overhead associated with managing them.
Overall, fiscal 2010 has been an excellent year of repositioning our homebuilding operations to capitalize on and drive our bottom line growth when the market conditions stabilize and improve. In addition to our homebuilding accomplishments, during fiscal 2010 our new segment, Rialto Investments, made several strategic investments which were accretive to our earnings. Rialto now employs over 100 Associates who are focused on purchasing distressed real estate loans and other real estate related assets at wholesale prices, working through and resolving the assets one at a time, and then selling them individually at retail prices.

                Some of the highlights for our Rialto Investments segment in fiscal 2010 include:
• Acquiring in partnership with the FDIC distressed residential and commercial real estate loans for approximately $243 million with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of approximately $3 billion and an initial fair value of approximately $1.2 billion
• Acquiring bank portfolios for $310 million with a total aggregate unpaid principal balance of over $500 million and REO properties with an original appraised value of approximately $200 million in separate transactions, from three financial institutions in September 2010
• Investing $63.8 million in the AllianceBernstein Public-Private Investment Program Fund which was created to purchase real estate related securities from banks and other financial institutions
• Completing its first closing in November of a real estate investment fund with initial equity commitments of approximately $300 million (including $75 million committed by our Company)
• Acting as the point of entry to access sellers and find and negotiate land that is not yet on the market for our homebuilding segment
Our homebuilding operations are on track to achieving sustainable profitability and our financial services and Rialto Investments segment will continue to enhance our earnings as the housing market stabilizes and ultimately recovers. With our balance sheet fortified with ample liquidity, we are once again positioned to continue to make strategic investments that will create long-term shareholder value.
Our Associates continue to be a bright spot at Lennar and their dedication and focus in all parts of the Company are a true source of pride. From the execution in the field to the cooperative spirit that exists between our homebuilding, financial services and Rialto operations, our Associates at Lennar are really making a difference.
Although high unemployment, tight lending standards and low consumer confidence continue to present challenges for the housing industry, we are confident that fiscal 2011 will be another profitable year for Lennar. We remain cautious about the immediate future and believe that we have properly positioned our Company to succeed in the current environment with the ability to further excel when the market recovers.
Sincerely,
Stuart A. Miller
President and Chief Executive Officer Lennar Corporation
