PURSUING INNOVATION AND PRODUCT AND SERVICES EXPANSION
Marketplace change demands innovation. Customers in all of our business segments face complex environments of ongoing change and uncertainty. Helping them succeed in the face of these challenges drives our innovation and product and service expansion strategies. OPTIMIZING ONLINE VISIBILITY. One of the critical needs for small businesses is getting found by potential customers on internet search engines. Succeeding at this is di cult for most small business owners as it requires a level of technical skill and expertise in paid and organic search. The acquisition of search engine optimization pioneer, OrangeSoda, greatly elevated our ability to help small businesses drive more tra c to their websites, develop e ective keyword strategies and improve their search engine rankings. REMOVING THE OBSTACLES TO CUSTOMER ACQUISITION. Customer acquisition is essential to the growth of nancial institutions, but switching banks can be arduous for consumers, particularly with the prevalence of online bill pay and ACH payments. In 2012, Deluxe was recognized at the Fall Finovate conference for our innovative SwitchAgent product that makes account transfers easier and faster. Using a combination of call center concierge service and proprietary software, SwitchAgent enables a bank's customer to quickly and easily transfer automated deposits and payments and online banking from their old bank account to their new bank account.

STANDING UP TO CHECK FRAUD. The continuing problem of check fraud has created strong demand for our check-related fraud solutions which utilize as many as 22 types of fraud protection and remediation techniques, including a distinctive holographic image. These checks provide increased comfort and protection for check users seeking to avoid the perils of fraud.

"Deluxe employees should feel proud to work for a company that recognizes the value of innovation, collaboration and the extraordinary impact that a group of people focused on a common goal can have in reshaping their industry." Lisa Brubaker WSFS Bank Wilmington, DE

"The main thing that in uenced my decision to go with Deluxe was the fact that they not only design and build the site, but they also stick with you throughout the entire process, managing the site, updating the site and marketing the site." Bryan Hiner, Tennis Fit

PURSUING MORE GROWTH AND MORE CUSTOMERS
Marketing Solutions and Other Services is a key area of growth for Deluxe. We see signi cant opportunity across all of our customer segments. PUTTING OUR EXPERTISE AT THE COMMAND OF SMALL BUSINESS. Many of our small business customers choose an entrepreneurial path in order to pursue a personal passion. However, most do not realize the time commitment required to manage the elements of their business that are outside that personal passion, such as marketing. Our goal is to put Deluxe product and service expertise at their command so they can focus on doing what they love. We further strengthened our ability to provide marketing service capabilities with the acquisition of OrangeSoda. The integration of OrangeSoda, PSPrint® and Hostopia® enable us to o er our customers everything they need to attract and retain customers, from websites to printing to search engine marketing. EXTENDING OUR REACH THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS. Throughout 2012, Deluxe sales and marketing teams successfully expanded the wholesale pipeline through partnerships with leading national and international telecommunication brands. At year's end, Deluxe emerged as one of this channel's largest providers of white-label website hosting services with approximately 550,000 small business websites. And the number continues to rise. By the end of 2013, we expect to be hosting as many as 750,000 small business websites. Outside of telecommunications, we added 20 new major accounts. Among these customers, sales of marketing services represents a growing share of our product mix. Our Safeguard® Distributor channel continues to grow. Safeguard distributors ll a unique niche in the market, employing a consultative selling strategy and working face-to-face with customers. Our long-standing and valued relationships with nancial institutions continue to strengthen and we are gaining market share with new customers such as Citizens Financial Group® . We continue to invest in check-related systems and capabilities, while leveraging our advisory expertise to help our customers optimize their check programs. Financial institutions rely on Deluxe for state-of-the-art check programs, but they increasingly need management tools to help them stay competitive, as well as pro table. Our solutions, including SwitchAgent and Cornerstone , enable our customers to better acquire and anchor new customers through a combination of marketing analytics and work ow automation. In addition, we are helping nancial institutions better manage their own nancial performance with our Banker's Dashboard® scorecard product.

PURSUING DEEPER CONNECTIONS WITH THOSE WE SERVE
Effectively serving our customers, recruiting the right talent and being a good citizen of our communities all reflect the value of connections. BUILDING BRAND AWARENESS. No two small business owners are alike. Each is in pursuit of a unique personal passion. Showing small business owners that we understand their desire to stay focused on doing what they love forms the core of our new messaging strategy. Getting this message out to small business owners requires an integrated media strategy that includes national print, online and television advertising. A cornerstone of this effort is the new deluxe.com, which was redesigned to meet the broad range of needs and varied levels of marketing sophistication inherent in the small business segment. For customers who prefer more hands-on support, we have focused on delivering a superior service experience in our call centers with a personal touch that few of our competitors can match. We will continually analyze, build, and improve on these strategies throughout the coming year. DEVELOPING THE PEOPLE AND THE CAPABILITIES TO CONTINUE OUR GROWTH. Our growth in Marketing Solutions and Other Services requires new capabilities in technology so we continue to recruit talent with cutting edge digital expertise. Deluxe has achieved exciting results through the innovative use of our Jobs2Web® talent community and online social networks, including LinkedIn.® We continue to win the admiration of the recruiting industry, and for the second consecutive year received the 2012 Candidate Experience Award for meeting standards of excellence in recruiting. SUPPORTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP THROUGH THE DELUXE FOUNDATION. The Deluxe Corporation Foundation focuses on long-term solutions that help people, businesses, and communities thrive and grow. During 2012, major grants in support of entrepreneurism were made to the following non-profit organizations: · SCORE ­ dedicated to helping small businesses get off the ground, grow and achieve their goals through education and mentorship. · Women's Business Development Center ­ the nation's oldest, largest and most successful small business assistance center for women · Metropolitan Economic Development Association (MEDA) ­ helping entrepreneurs of color succeed by providing business consulting, training and leadership development services. In 2012, Deluxe was honored by MEDA as its Corporation of the Year.

FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS, Deluxe grew revenue in 2012 for the third consecutive year for the rst time in 16 years. We also had our highest annual revenue growth rate since 1994 excluding the NEBS acquisition. We stabilized our core check and product businesses while adding innovative high security features and improved our mix of faster growing marketing solutions and other services revenues to 19 percent of total revenue. We acquired OrangeSoda to expand opportunities in higher growth marketing solutions and other services. We also took steps to accelerate our brand transformation with our new "Work Happy" campaign. We want small business owners to see Deluxe as a genuine, passionate partner who gives them everything they need, so they can focus on their pursuit of doing what they love and "Work Happy." In addition to our strong print leadership, we continued to invest in our employment brand, in digital technology, in extending our sales channel reach, and in our communities. Our e orts earned us awards and recognition, including The Candidate Experience Award, Best in Show at Finovate, the corporation of the year from the Metropolitan Economic Development Association, and the Je erson Award for community service.

Our intense focus on cost reductions has now delivered enterprise-wide savings of $435 million since mid2006. In 2012, we continued to improve e ciencies across the organization through process centralization, simpli cation, platform and tool consolidation and leveraging e-commerce capabilities. We also advanced our lean and spoilage reduction initiatives and improved our strategic supplier arrangements, among many other successful initiatives. We nished the year with more robust and innovative products and services, solidi ed processes, a better infrastructure, a new brand campaign, and improved nancial results. Our operating cash ow grew for the fourth straight year, allowing us to maintain our dividend and pay down debt, while further advancing our transformation by paying cash for the OrangeSoda acquisition and other strategic investments. In addition, we strengthened our capital structure in November with a debt re- nancing at a lower rate and extended term. We recognize that there is still a tremendous amount of work to do, but we made great strides in 2012 and, in spite of what we expect will be a continued challenging economy, the entire Deluxe team is committed to building on our progress.

WE FINISHED THE YEAR WITH MORE ROBUST AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SOLIDIFIED PROCESSES, A BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE, A NEW BRAND CAMPAIGN, AND IMPROVED FINANCIAL RESULTS.

PURSUING PROFITABLE REVENUE GROWTH As we enter 2013, our primary focus continues to be pro table revenue growth and increasing the mix of marketing solutions and other services revenues. We have created more di erentiated, technology-led check o ers through investments in high security, automated at packaging, digital printing, and online portals and dashboards. We also have signi cant growth opportunities in marketing solutions and other services. For small businesses this includes logo design, web services, social media, web-to-print, search engine marketing and optimization, payroll, and fraud and security services; and for nancial institutions we are pursuing growth through customer acquisition, risk management, and other value-add services o ers. We will continue to assess potential small- to medium-size acquisitions that complement our large customer bases with a focus on marketing solutions and other services. We have strengthened our channels in small business to include nancial institutions, online, retail, wholesale, distributors, dealers, and major accounts. Deluxe is now more capable of helping small businesses pursue their passion by being a trusted provider of everything a small business needs to market and operate their business, and helping small- to mid-size nancial institutions with customer acquisition, risk management, and other value-add services o ers.
SMALL BUSINESS SERVICES

Revenue grew nearly 14% in 2012 and represented the strongest growth rate since the 2004 NEBS acquisition. Double-digit growth in marketing solutions and other services revenues more than o set declines in our core small business products. We enhanced our internet presence, increased average order value and conversion rates, won many signi cant new wholesale and major account customers, and ended the year with approximately 550,000 web hosting customers. Our 2013 focus is on accelerating our brand transformation and signi cantly improving overall market awareness while institutionalizing our brand promise for our customers, pro tably integrating and extending our marketing solutions and other services portfolio, e ectively acquiring and retaining customers across multiple channels, building a more e ective retail services sales model, scaling major accounts and strategic channel partner relationships, and improving our customer experience.
FINANCIAL SERVICES

Revenue was basically flat in 2012 from 2011. The continued shift to electronic payments, banking industry regulatory uncertainty, and the economy all negatively impacted check orders and marketing solutions and other services in spite of our continued strong retention and new customer acquisition rates. We onboarded Citizens Financial Group in January 2012. We made progress in advancing marketing solutions and other services with our Cornerstone customer acquisition o erings, with Banker's Dashboard® , with SwitchAgent , and with fraud, security, and other risk management o ers. Our 2013 focus is on gaining share in core check revenue, simplifying our business model, and growing, including extending our marketing solutions and other services o ers for nancial institutions. This includes providing customer acquisition, risk management, and other value-added services o ers that di erentiate us from competitors and make us a more relevant business partner to our nancial institution clients.

DIRECT CHECKS

Revenue declined 7% in 2012 due to lower consumer check purchases in a continued sluggish economy. We continue to be the nation's leading direct-to-consumer check supplier. We made progress in creating an integrated best-in-class, direct-to-consumer check experience by consolidating both call center and ful llment operations while scaling revenue through our call center scripting and up-sell capabilities. For 2013, we expect to continue work to create a best-in-class, direct-to-the-consumer check experience. Our focus is on maximizing operating cash ow and the lifetime value of our customers by selling checks and additional features and accessories. We expect to reduce our manufacturing costs and lower selling, general and administrative expenses and drive strong operating margins while generating strong cash ow. OUR QUEST FOR SUSTAINABLE REVENUE GROWTH In Small Business Services, we spent 2012 examining our marketing strategies, holding focus groups, looking at large research studies, and shadowing small business owners while they work. Through this process, we uncovered insights that will help us connect with our customers on a more emotional level. We learned that the primary motivator for today's small business owner has shifted from business growth to personal satisfaction. This insight forms the basis of our new brand campaign and redesign of deluxe.com, and it will be at the core of our small business marketing e orts, and products and services o ers, going forward. In Financial Services, we are growing beyond checks into a broad set of solutions that help nancial institutions acquire customers and protect themselves and consumers. Our technologies and channels are stronger, our digital technology services o ers more mature, our infrastructure better, and our management talent deeper and aligned to grow revenue. We have developed a strong platform for long-term growth with the objective of transforming Deluxe into more of a growth services provider from primarily a check printer. We believe these product mix changes will help continue to position Deluxe to pro tably grow, which will attract additional investors and result in a higher stock multiple and price. We believe we are well positioned entering 2013 for our fourth consecutive year of revenue growth. Despite the sluggish economy, our nancial discipline has enabled us to invest in people, technology, products, services, and our brand in order to position ourselves for sustainable revenue growth, while continuing to improve pro tability and operating cash ow. We know it is critical for us to be able to grow revenue again in 2013 and improve the mix of our marketing solutions and other services revenue, and we are well positioned to make this happen. In closing, my continued sincere thanks again to all Deluxers for your unwavering enthusiasm and dedication, to our customers for your loyalty and trust, to our partners for your engagement and commitment, and to our shareholders for your support and con dence. We know through the continued hard work, determination, and engagement of our employees, partners, and customers, we will create continued value for our shareholders.

WE KNOW IT IS CRITICAL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO GROW REVENUE AGAIN IN 2013 AND IMPROVE THE MIX OF OUR MARKETING SOLUTIONS AND OTHER SERVICES REVENUE, AND WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
