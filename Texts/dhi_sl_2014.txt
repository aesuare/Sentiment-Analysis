Dear Fellow Shareholders:
Fiscal 2014 was a great year for D.R. Horton, Inc. We closed 46% more homes than any other homebuilder in the United States and achieved the largest national market share in the Company’s history, strengthening our 13-year leading position in the homebuilding industry. Our broad geographic base and product diversity, financial strength and supply of land, lots and homes are allowing us to leverage our competitive position to achieve strong growth in both revenues and profits. At the same time, our management team is also focused on continuing to improve our operational efficiency and our returns on invested capital.
Our financial achievements during fiscal 2014 included the following:
• 27% increase in the value of net sales orders;
• 28% increase in total revenues;
• $2.9 billion sales order backlog, up 29% from a year ago;
• $814.2 million of consolidated pre-tax income, up from $657.8 million in fiscal 2013; and
• $5.1 billion of total equity, up from $4.1 billion a year ago.
The key to our success is our ongoing focus on the fundamentals of our business in each of our communities across the 79 markets in which we operate. Our experienced operational teams in each market are responsible for building quality homes, ensuring our product offerings and pricing align with customer demand in each community and serving our customers with excellence. Our local teams strive to manage our business in each market in a manner that will achieve the optimal balance of sales pace, pricing, profit margins and inventory levels in each community and maximize the returns on our inventory investments.
During fiscal 2014 we introduced a new brand, Express Homes, to offer affordable homes for entry-level homebuyers, and we continued to roll out our Emerald Homes brand of higher-end move-up and luxury communities. Both the Express and Emerald brands have received positive consumer reception, and we plan to introduce many more of these communities across our markets in fiscal 2015. These brands are expanding our product diversity across our already broad geographic footprint, which is positioning our operations for further growth.
As our fiscal year came to a close, our CEO, Don Tomnitz, announced his retirement after more than 30 years with the Company and 15 years as President and CEO, during which time we became the largest homebuilder in the United States. We thank Don for his outstanding leadership and invaluable contributions to our company, including the development of our current management team, led by David Auld, that will guide the Company in the future.
We are well-positioned to achieve another strong year of growth in revenues and profitability in fiscal 2015. Our employees are the best in the industry, and their dedication and daily efforts to improve our operations are driving our success. We thank all of our suppliers, subcontractors, real estate agents and lenders for their valuable relationships. Finally, we appreciate our shareholders for your consistent support, as we strive to validate your trust by delivering sustainable value, addressing future challenges directly and remaining the leader in the homebuilding industry.
Donald R. Horton
Chairman of the Board
