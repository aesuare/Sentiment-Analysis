 Dear Stakeholders:
I will first discuss our 2015 results and then provide a few thoughts on the future.

Clinical Outcomes and Care Initiatives:
DaVita HealthCare Partners and our affiliated physicians collaborated to achieve outstanding clinical outcomes in 2015.
For the 15th consecutive year we continue to drive improvements in our industry-leading clinical outcomes. By the end of the year:
• 73% of our dialysis patients had an arteriovenous fistula placed for dialysis, • 92% of our dialysis patients had been vaccinated for pneumonia,
• 92% of our dialysis patients had been vaccinated for influenza, and
• 97% of our dialysis patients had achieved a Kt/V of 1.2 or better.
All these results compare quite favorably to those reported publicly for other dialysis providers, especially when adjusted for acuity and other socioeconomic factors.
DaVita dialysis centers led the industry in the new Five-Star Quality Rating System used by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), with 46% of our facilities receiving a star rating of four or five stars, compared to just 22% of facilities for the rest of the industry. DaVita dialysis centers also led in CMS’ End Stage Renal Disease Quality Incentive Program for the second year in a row with the most dialysis centers ranking in the top clinical performance tier.
Our HCP physicians have a strong focus on clinical quality outcomes and patient satisfaction with more than 80% of our Medicare Advantage patients in plans rated four stars or above in the Medicare Advantage Star Rating program.
SCAN Health Plan recognized HCP for the quality of care and service delivered by its medical professionals and staff. Selection is based on HCP’s performance score of four stars or higher – on a five-star scale – in areas such as preventive screenings, treatment of chronic conditions and appropriate documentation.
Our quality clinical care not only results in healthier patients, but also drives reductions in total healthcare cost, and therefore significant savings to the U.S. health care system.

Financial:
Growth:
Adjusted net income in 2015 was $828 million(1), or $3.83(1) per share, GAAP net income was $270 million, or $1.25 per share.
Cash flow from operations in 2015 was $1.557 billion and free cash flow was $1.056 billion(1). These strong cash flows allowed us to spend $477 million on center developments and acquisitions and $550 million on repurchases of our common stock in 2015.
We provided nearly 26.0 million dialysis treatments in 2015, a 4.0% increase from 2014. Our 2015 normalized non-acquired growth was 3.9% year-over- year.
DaVita Rx, the world’s largest full-service pharmacy dedicated to serving the unique needs of kidney patients, now provides services for approximately 165,000 patients.
We continued our international expansion. By year-end 2015 we operated 118 clinics in ten countries outside the United States.
Being a leader in American healthcare means being a responsible corporate community. The Trilogy of Care—Caring for our patients, each other, and the world—is DaVita HealthCare Partners’ vision for social responsibility and is our philosophy for balancing our business responsibilities with our social, economic and environmental ones. For more than a decade, we have had a vision for creating a true community—one that cares for our teammates as well as our patients. This investment in creating a community has inspired our teammates to realize their full potential and to deliver ever-improving quality care to our patients.
• For the fifth anniversary of the DaVita Way of Giving program, teammates at nearly 1,900 DaVita Kidney Care centers and HCP sites directed $2 million of company donations to locally based charities across the United States. The program has donated more than $6 million since it began.
• In 2015, Bridge of Life, the primary program of DaVita Village Trust, an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, completed more than 30 international medical missions and over 50 domestic missions and chronic kidney disease screening events. More than 300 DaVita volunteers supported these missions, impacting nearly 17,000 men, women and children in 15 countries.
• More than 550 riders participated in Tour DaVita, DaVita’s annual 250- mile charity bike ride, which raised $1.2 million to support Bridge of Life. Bridge of Life serves thousands of men, women and children around the world through kidney care, primary care, education and prevention and medically supported camps for kids.
• Because of the efforts of DaVita Village Green and DaVita’s clinical enterprise and biomedical teams, DaVita dialysis centers are on average using nearly 30 percent fewer gallons of water per dialysis treatment in 2015 than they did in 2010, and we are working towards our goal to reduce energy consumption by 15 percent across our footprint.
We invite you to review our work and be inspired to help change your community. Our 2015 Community Care social responsibility report is available at DaVita.com/communitycare/.
Corporate Citizenship:

Outlook:
Over the next few years we will face numerous challenges, including government reimbursement pressures, risks associated with government investigations and private lawsuits, uncertainty around health care reimbursement, and the risks arising from driving change and growth at HCP.
We believe our combined enterprise offers exciting levels of clinical quality, service, and consumer/taxpayer savings. Both DaVita Kidney Care and HCP continue to execute on our integrated care mission by partnering with thousands of physicians across the country to lead the transformation of health care delivery.
I offer heartfelt thanks to our 64,000 teammates around the world. Your resilience and tenacity in simultaneously meeting the needs of so many diverse constituencies is remarkable.

Kent J. Thiry
Chairman and CEO, and CEO HealthCare Partners
