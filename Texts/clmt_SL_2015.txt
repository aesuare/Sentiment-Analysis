                   Letter from Executive Vice Chairman, F. William Grube
FELLOW INVESTORS
I am pleased to report that the Partnership generated strong full- year Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow in 2015, excluding special items, due mainly to balanced contributions from our specialty products and fuel products segments. This performance positioned the Partnership to return more than $220 million in cash distributions to unitholders last year, which included the declaration of our 40th consecutive cash distribution in early 2016. Since our initial public offering in 2006, we have returned more than $1 billion in total capital to our unitholders, and we remain committed to positioning the Partnership to produce returns that are consistent with a stable-to-growing cash distribution, over the long term.
 The Year in Review
The global commodities markets were volatile during 2015, as the price of crude oil plummeted from more than $100 per barrel in mid-2014 to less than $40 per barrel by year-end 2015. Lower-cost producers of crude oil, such as the member countries that comprise the OPEC syndicate, continued
to supply significant volumes of crude oil to the global energy markets last year, thereby forcing higher-cost producers, such as those in emerging regional shale plays here in the United States, to reduce or even shut down crude oil production. The impact on the domestic energy complex was devastating, as companies involved in the production, extraction and transportation of crude oil all suffered from sharply reduced activity.
Yet, while most of the domestic energy complex was entrenched in a quagmire of daunting proportion, one energy sub-sector – petroleum refining – had an outstanding year. The decline in crude oil prices, which
represents the single most significant cost for any refiner, often outpaced the decline in refined product prices, resulting in elevated refined product margins throughout most
of 2015.
Our specialty products segment had
an excellent year, as our cost of feedstocks declined well below the blended average
sales price of the more than 4,500 petroleum- based formulations we produce. Our specialty products gross profit per barrel, excluding special items, averaged $45.39 in 2015, while segment-level Adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, increased by more than 9% from the prior-year period to $250.5 million.
Our fuel products segment benefited from a combination of factors last year. Our
20,000 barrels per day of heavy fuel oils production, which is generally a “residual” product during the fuels refining process, was profitable in 2015. This result was primarily due to the prices for paving asphalt and roofing flux staying range-bound. Furthermore, lower

                 crude oil prices translated into lower fuels prices at the pump, resulting in strong demand for gasoline during the year, a trend that we expect to continue into 2016.
Overall, the benchmark 2/1/1 Gulf Coast crack spread, which represents a theoretical gross profit margin on each barrel of fuel products sold, increased to $18 per barrel in 2015, versus $17 per barrel in the prior
10 years. Although product margins for most U.S. refiners remain healthy by historical standards, the fuels refining margin outlook remains fluid; from our vantage point, and
at such time those margins revert back to normalized levels (as they have occasion to
do), we continue to believe that the winners in fuels refining will be operators with niche, inland market refineries with access to cost-advantaged crude oil and those operators that can sustain the lowest cost structure.
Today, we estimate that approximately
20 to 25 percent of the crude oil processed
at our refineries is heavy Canadian crude oil. Given that Canadian production of crude oil is forecasted to continue to increase significantly for the foreseeable future, inventories of Western Canadian Select (WCS) are expected to remain abundant – and cheap. In fact, last year, WCS was, on average, approximately $12 per barrel cheaper than WTI; for Calumet’s inland, niche fuels refineries that process WCS, such as our Superior, WI and Great Falls, MT facilities, this crude oil discount is a considerable competitive
advantage that stands to help drive continued growth in Adjusted EBITDA within our fuel products segment over time.
Harvesting Returns on Invested Capital
Beginning in 2013, we initiated three organic growth projects that, in the years that followed, would require investment of more than $600 million. In early 2016, these projects came to completion, positioning us to reap incremental cash flow from our investments. These three projects are:
» A significant expansion of production capacity at our Great Falls, Montana refinery from 10,000 to 25,000 bpd;
» A project at our San Antonio refinery designed to convert a portion of our diesel production to higher-margin specialty solvents; and
» A doubling of production capacity at our Louisiana, Missouri esters plant
Although market dynamics have shifted since we first began these projects three years ago, we currently anticipate that these projects should generate significant incremental Adjusted EBITDA on a combined, annualized basis over time.
Importantly, with this organic growth campaign having reached conclusion in early 2016, we anticipate a significant decline in capital spending in 2016. Currently, we expect total capital spending, which includes growth, maintenance, turnaround and environmental spending, should be approximately $125-150 million in 2016, down from approximately $425 million in 2015.

                 Focused on the Future
In 2015, I announced that I would be stepping down from day-to-day operations as CEO. Following a rigorous search process, the Board of Directors unanimously selected Tim Go
as the next CEO of Calumet. With more than 25 years of independent refining experience, including 20 years at ExxonMobil and seven years at Koch Industries, Tim’s combination
of exceptional leadership skills and deep operational expertise positions him as the ideal new leader for Calumet.
While Calumet is an organization with a rich legacy, I am confident its best years are ahead. Our ability to focus on what we do best – specialty products refining – will continue
to define us in the years that follow, guided by a dedicated, talented team of people, in addition to a General Partner that remains highly supportive of Calumet’s long-term, profitable growth.
I want to thank all of our unitholders, employees, customers, communities and other stakeholders for your support in 2015 and beyond.

            Driving Organic Growth in Our Business
In early 2016, Calumet completed three organic growth projects, positioning us to reap incremental cash flow from our investments. These three projects are:
» Expansion of our Great Falls, Montana refinery from a throughput capacity of 10,000 bpd to 25,000 bpd. The investment provides for a new crude unit, 20,000-bpd mild hydrocracker, hydrogen plant, sulfur scrubbing units, and tankage and loading facilities. The refinery approached full production rates in early 2016.
» Doubling production capacity at our Missouri esters plant to 75 million pounds per year. The project reached mechanical completion in fourth quarter 2015 and Calumet began selling products to customers in first quarter 2016.
» Conversion of the ultra-low-sulfur diesel production at our San Antonio refinery to 3,000 bpd of higher-value solvents. The refinery began the sale of low aromatic solvents to both domestic and international markets during first quarter 2016.
