FROM THE CHAIRMAN
Dear shareholders, neighbors and friends,
The Vulcan story is one of fundamental, lasting value. As a business, we offer notable strengths — strategic focus, substantial reserves, operational excellence, a nationwide footprint concentrated in America’s primary growth markets, and consistently strong results. As an investment, our many long-term shareholders know that we have grown significantly through major acquisitions over the years and have consistently outperformed the market over time. As a neighbor, within the many communities we call home, we manage our lands for the long-term benefit of all concerned.
In 2007, we posted another record year. Vulcan reached record levels of full year sales, net cash provided by operating activities, operating earnings and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). Consolidated net sales were $3.1 billion in 2007, an increase of 2 percent from the prior year’s record level. Net cash provided by operating activities of $708 million increased 22 percent from the 2006 level of $579 million. Operating earnings for 2007 were $714 million, up 3 percent from the 2006 level of $695 million. EBITDA in 2007 was $981 million, up 3 percent from the $950 million reported in 2006.*

We generated these improved results despite weaker demand for our products. While Vulcan is not as exposed as some others in our industry to the cycles of the homebuilding marketplace, the sharp downturn in residential construction activity was only partially offset by increased levels of highway construction and nonresi- dential construction.
A market environment that recognizes the high cost of replacing reserves has been instrumental for price improvement despite lower volumes. The average selling price for aggregates increased 13 percent in 2007, even with an approximate 9 percent decline in aggregates shipments. We expect the pricing momentum we achieved in 2005 and 2006, which continued in 2007, to also continue through 2008.
While market conditions remain uncertain, we expect another year of record sales and net cash provided by operating activities. The broad use of aggregates in construction and the multi-year nature of highway and infrastructure projects should help offset continued weakness in residential construction and some softening in certain categories of private nonresidential construction. Leading indicators such as contract awards for highways and nonresidential construction in Vulcan-served markets continue to grow and lead other U.S. markets. We expect the demand for aggregates in our markets for public infrastructure projects and for nonresidential construction to increase in 2008.
The Florida Rock acquisition significantly bolstered our aggregates reserves in attractive markets, consistent with our long-term strategy. When the window of opportunity opened, we acted, because the addition of Florida Rock’s operations and reserves makes us better over the long term, just as our acquisitions of CalMat, Tarmac, White’s Mines and so many others have done before. It is worth pointing out that each of these moves initially presented challenges, yet now those assets are an integral and strong part of our core business. The long- term view of value creation that has always guided our business, and that always will, has served Vulcan’s shareholders very well.
As with every major acquisition in our history, this one will change and improve Vulcan’s capacity to serve our chosen growth markets. At Vulcan, we will keep doing what we do best:
• Focusing on aggregates • Serving growth markets • Delivering results
• Growing
• Managing for the long term

Vulcan is the leader in an essential industry and we take a long-term view. We remain steadfastly community-oriented and grounded in the common good. Managing for the long term includes responsible and effective land management. We know the value of being a good neighbor, and act accordingly. Vulcan strives to be the industry leader in safety, health and environmental stewardship as well as in quarry beautification.
We also know that responsible land management is an essential and productive business strategy. Mining is an interim use of land, albeit an immensely important one. Our land management plans benefit from the input of citizens and local governments with an eye on how sites will best serve the interests of the local economy and the community when mining ends. When the time is right and operations cease at a given location, we look for ways to reclaim the site for profitable development. It’s the kind of thing that a good neighbor, and a good business, does.
As we look to the future, we welcome the challenges ahead and are excited about what the addition of Florida Rock means to our business going forward, as it significantly increases our capacity to serve the near and long-term needs of our country. Perhaps nowhere are these needs more apparent than in the declining state of public infrastructure in the United States.
Forecasts and recommendations from the recent National Surface Transportation Policy and Revenue Study Commission Report, commissioned by Congress, underline the pressing need for infra- structure investments both public and private in the immediate future and beyond. That speaks directly to our strengths. Among other things, the Report calls for massive improvements in most if not all of Vulcan’s key cities and regions — the growth markets we call home. We are seeing increasing signs that elected officials at all levels of government as well as private citizens are ready to do something about infrastructure needs in America.
The collapse of Minnesota’s Interstate 35W bridge on August 1, 2007, put the fragile nature of the nation’s infrastructure in stark relief. As the Report states, in no uncertain terms, “...the transportation challenges facing the Nation have reached crisis proportions — the deferred maintenance of its basic infrastructure; the burgeoning international trade and its impact on our road and rail networks; the traffic congestion that is crippling metropolitan America... The future of our Nation’s well-being, vitality, and global economic leadership is at stake. We need to invest at least $225 billion annually from all sources for the next 50 years to upgrade our existing system to a state of good repair and create a more advanced surface transportation system to sustain and ensure strong economic growth for our families. We are spending less than 40 percent of this amount today.”

We agree with the Commission’s findings and will work to help enact laws that further these efforts. We are ideally suited to play a part. Vulcan was founded over fifty years ago as a public company intending to serve and grow with the Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. That program helped spur not only our growth, but more importantly, the growth and strength of our nation’s economy and the concurrent rise of the United States as a global superpower. We have seen firsthand how policy can create wealth for our nation. Investments in infrastructure — from the railroads 150 years ago to the Eisenhower program to the Report’s recommended reinvestment in the transportation backbone of our economy — create national prosperity and a sustained environment of ceaseless, productive activity.
Vulcan today, with Florida Rock and the other acquisitions we’ve made over the years, is extremely well situated to fulfill America’s needs to rebuild and grow its infrastructure. Our coast-to-coast footprint aligns with and overlays the areas of greatest need and opportunity, and we intend to play an increasingly crucial role in infrastructure maintenance and development nationwide.
