 To the Shareholders and Employees of The Boeing Company:
2011 was a watershed for Boeing—a pivotal year in which we delivered strong operating results and made substantial progress on the business and product strategies that are critical to our future and our customers’ success. The unrelenting focus of Boeing employees on program performance, productivity improvement, and teamwork resulted in near-record financial performance and
a slate of accomplishments rivaling that of any year in recent memory. Boeing is a stronger, more competitive company in 2012—with a clearer view of our future and an unprecedented opportunity for growth in the years ahead.
2011 Review
Our core production programs and services businesses in Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space & Security performed exceptionally well in 2011, leading to operating margins near 10 percent in each of these businesses.
We finished the year with record revenues of $68.7 bil- lion. Net earnings nearly equaled an all-time high at more than $4 billion. And our strong operating cash flow of
$4 billion maintained healthy liquidity of $11.3 billion.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes delivered 477 airplanes in 2011 and recorded 805 new orders (net of cancella- tions), including a 150-plane launch order for our new 737 MAX. We also extended our market-share lead in the twin-aisle segment with a record 200 orders for the 777 and a key sale of 27 new 767 freighters. Commercial Aviation Services continued its double-digit growth trajectory, increasing revenues 11 percent.
Perhaps most important, during the year we ushered in a new era in aviation and retired key technical and business risks with the certification and first deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 Freighter. Getting to this point on these technically challenging programs was not easy.
But thanks to the passion and ingenuity of our people, we have created two incredible new airplanes that will deliver significant value to our customers and to Boeing for decades to come. The airplanes are performing well in service, earning praise from passengers and operators.
Likewise, customer response to our launch of the 737 MAX was swift and positive. In only four months, we received more than 1,000 orders and commitments for this new- engine variant of the single-aisle 737, which will be 10 to 12 percent more fuel efficient than today’s 737 and cost significantly less to operate than its competitors. With development costs and risks far below an all-new airplane, the 737 MAX will provide customers the capabilities they want, at a price they are willing to pay, on a shorter, more certain timeline. This approach is an all-around winner
for Boeing, too. We maintain our qualitative advantage over competitors in the segment, we free up resources to invest in other growth projects, and we reduce our busi- ness risk substantially for the next decade.

We also continued to incrementally increase our pro- duction rates in 2011 to meet growing market demand and speed the flow of airplanes to customers. We increased the 737 rate from 31.5 per month to 35 per month and raised the 777 rate from five per month
to seven per month—both historic highs. We plan to raise the 737 rate to 38 per month in the second quarter of 2013 and to 42 per month in the first half of 2014. Production of the 777 will increase to more than eight per month in the first quarter of 2013.
Although we fell short of our 2011 target for 787 deliv- eries, we successfully increased production to 2.5 planes per month in our Everett, Washington, facility. With improving performance throughout the supply chain, we raised the rate to 3.5 per month in the first quarter of 2012, and plan to increase the rate to 5 per month by year-end.
Our new 787 final assembly facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, which opened midyear, has made steady progress with its first 787s; the inaugural delivery from that site is scheduled for mid-2012.
The combined production rate across both 787 facili- ties is slated to reach 10 per month in late 2013.
Overall, we ended 2011 with a backlog of 3,771 firm commercial airplane orders valued at a company record $296 billion—setting the stage for unprece- dented and lasting growth.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security also achieved strong operational success in 2011. We delivered 115 military jets, 131 new and remanufactured helicopters, four satellites and more than 10,500 weapons sys- tems. Key milestones included the final space shuttle mission; introduction of the Block III Apache helicop- ter; and deliveries of the first Intelsat 702 MP satellite, the 500th on-cost, on-schedule F/A-18 Super Hornet, and the final KC-767 tankers to the Italian Air Force.
Despite U.S. budget constraints, revenues held steady at $32 billion on customer demand for our core offerings and increased international sales, which grew to 24 percent of revenues. We also strengthened our market position and growth
prospects with an impressive string of strategic wins and new contract awards:
— In winning the U.S. Air Force KC-46 tanker program, we will design, develop and build 179 next-generation 767-based tankers, maintain our 50-year franchise in the business, and open a sizeable international market.
— A U.S. government agreement with Saudi Arabia for 84 new F-15s and upgrades to 70 existing ones will extend F-15 production for several years and position it well for more international sales.
— Our U.S. Navy contract for 13 P-8A Poseidons begins a production run of this 737 derivative that we expect will exceed 100 airplanes.
— Winning the Ground-based Midcourse Defense development and sustainment contract preserves our role as prime contractor and keeps us at the forefront of critical missile defense technology.
— And, contracts for the core rocket stages and the avionics system for NASA’s new Space Launch System ensures Boeing a leading role in the future of U.S. space exploration.
We also expanded our reach into important growth markets by opening a Cyber Engagement Center, acquiring information solutions provider Solutions Made Simple, and reaching test milestones on our Phantom Eye and Phantom Ray unmanned aerial vehicles.
Defense, Space & Security’s year-end backlog of $60 billion—still nearly twice 2011 revenues—ranks among the industry’s highest and reflects the on- going strength of our product-and-services portfolio.
The Path Forward
Last year we defined our priorities for achieving sustained growth—and continued global leadership in aerospace—as we approach our 100th anniversary in 2016. We made considerable progress on each of our priorities in 2011, but more work remains to be done to unleash our full potential.

With strong core operating performance as our bed- rock, and substantial growth already booked in our backlog, our goal is to convert these foundational strengths into sustained business performance—the year-in, year-out excellence that defines the world’s top-performing companies. By focusing on disciplined execution, productivity improvements to continuously fund innovation, and improved management of our risks, I am convinced our team can consistently deliver the high levels of performance and value that our stakeholders expect.
At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, our top priority now is to deliver on the growth in our record backlog, while ensuring continuity for our business as we scale it up dramatically to meet market demands.
Over the next three years alone, planned production- rate increases will boost our commercial airplane output by more than 40 percent. Last December, we retired significant risk to this growth plan by reach- ing an early, four-year contract extension with our machinists’ union in Puget Sound. The agreement helps secure delivery stability for our customers and economics that will make us more competitive. Other recent steps taken to ensure business continuity include rebalancing the 787 work done in-house and by our global partners, and expanding and diversify- ing our manufacturing and engineering base in
South Carolina and other locations.
Our priorities, then, for Commercial Airplanes are: First, steadily and profitably increase production rates to deliver our 3,771-airplane backlog; second, execute 787-9 and 737 MAX development efforts on plan; third, continue to grow our services business; and fourth, extend our lead in the twin-aisle segment with potential advances in our 777 and 787 families.
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, while flat to declining defense budgets will continue to character- ize U.S. and European markets, we foresee significant growth potential in other regions, including the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, that will provide opportunities to mitigate the impact of domestic reductions.
Government customers also continue to push for reduced costs and greater efficiencies in defense spending, and more of their limited dollars are going toward new capabilities in unmanned systems; intel- ligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; logistics; and cyber and infrastructure security.
Anticipating this environment, we have been making the necessary changes to compete effectively. In addition to pursuing and capturing a larger share
of international sales, we have made 11 strategic acquisitions—and invested internally—to build the new capabilities sought by our customers. We have also taken significant steps to reduce infrastructure and other costs, and further increase productivity to enable continued investments in innovation.
Fortunately, our markets are large and global, and
we compete across a broad range of product-and- services segments, from military aircraft, to commercial and military satellites, to network systems and space exploration, to integrated logistics, and training systems and services. With customers demanding greater value for every dollar spent, our portfolio of reliable, proven and affordable products and services is a competitive advantage.
As such, our Defense, Space & Security priorities are: First, extend and grow our core business by bringing capability and affordability to our customers; second, capture additional international business; and third, continue to strengthen our capabilities in the afore- mentioned higher-growth spending areas—through both internal investments and targeted acquisitions.
One-Company Advances
For several years now, we have worked to foster a more open and inclusive culture that values com- mon goals, personal accountability, integrity and trust as a means to achieve better business results. We also have purposefully redesigned much of the organization to sharpen the focus in our businesses, strengthen our functions, and enable growth by bringing the best of Boeing to every effort.

Our successes in 2011 provide compelling evidence that this strategy is working. Our people are embrac- ing teamwork more than ever and are using the size and scope of our company—with its vast knowledge and capabilities—to solve problems more quickly and compete more effectively.
There is no greater example of this “One Boeing” advantage than our winning the U.S. Air Force tanker competition—a collaborative effort that leveraged the unique strengths of our two major businesses and several core functions. Enterprisewide, our Boeing Test & Evaluation team conducted more than 8,400 test flights in 181 locations in 32 countries, leading the way to certification of the 787 and 747-8, and spurring advances on the P-8A and other programs. Collabora- tion across our Boeing International, Government Operations, Boeing Capital and other functional teams was instrumental in a range of achievements, from winning key commercial airplane sales campaigns to gaining approval of the Saudi F-15 purchase.
Sustaining and furthering this culture is the job of leadership. Between now and 2014, we may need
to replace up to 30,000 employees who could leave Boeing through either retirement or attrition; that’s on top of more than 16,000 new employees we hired in 2011. While turnover of such magnitude is its own challenge, it also presents us a major opportunity to rapidly instill this company’s purpose and values into the employees who will drive our performance for the next 30 to 40 years.
The Environment and Our Communities
Reducing the environmental footprint of our products and operations is a long-standing company commit- ment. Last year, a broad industry effort led by Boeing won approval for the use of cleaner, sustainable biofu- els in commercial and military aviation worldwide. We also began powering our South Carolina production facility with 100 percent renewable energy generated, in part, by solar panels on the new 787 final assembly building. This facility also achieved Zero Waste to Landfill status, meaning that all of its waste materials and by-products are recycled, reused or repurposed— thereby reducing its environmental footprint.
6
We continue to work toward our five-year goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, hazardous-waste generation, and water intake by 25 percent on a revenue-adjusted basis and by
1 percent on an absolute basis. While our unprece- dented increases in airplane production have made these goals more challenging, we remain on track
to achieve the targeted absolute reduction on most measures and expect our revenue-adjusted improve- ments will still reach the mid to high teens.
In 2011, Boeing, our employees, our retirees and our charitable trust invested more than $147 million in communities around the world. Our employees also contributed thousands of hours in volunteer service, in many cases sharing unique professional skills or expertise honed inside the company to help commu- nity partners achieve their goals in service to others. We also hired more than 1,800 military veterans, whose skills and experience matched our needs.
Our Moment
These are exciting times for the people of Boeing. With strong product-and-services strategies, a record backlog of orders, and a commitment to inno- vation and continuous improvement, we are poised for significant and sustained growth that will carry us into our second century of aerospace leadership.
And by continuing to do the right things—the right way—we will preserve our place among the most respected and capable companies in all of business.
In many ways, this is the moment we have been waiting for—and working toward—for many years. I am proud to lead this team, and I look forward to delivering on the promise.
