letter to shareholders

Dear shareholder: In 2010, the elevated focus on the U.S. health care system--both its greatness and its shortcomings--was striking.

There is a growing national will to address core issues in the health care system to make it work better for everyone. Recognition of the need for fundamental change makes this a time of significant challenge and opportunity for the modernization of health care. We see new markets opening, new opportunities to serve and new growth for our enterprise.
For three decades, we have worked to develop innovative, practical and financially responsible ways to make higher quality health care more accessible and affordable for more people. We focus on making it easier for people to get the care they need, personalizing and simplifying their health care experience, strengthening the bonds between patients and physicians, modernizing technology to improve

consistency and connectivity among all the participants in health care and finding new ways to improve quality while controlling the rising costs of health care. In 2010, this approach to serving people in health care enabled us to exceed our growth goals. Our revenue grew by 8 percent, or $7 billion, reaching $94 billion in 2010. We met our financial commitments for 2010 and introduced a meaningful dividend to our shareholders. Our Health Benefits businesses are growing. In 2010, our benefits businesses were privileged to serve a million more people than in 2009. They also transitioned smoothly and successfully to a single, unifying brand name, UnitedHealthcare. Our benefits platform has strong growth capacity, across geographies, products and benefit sponsors. Millions more people will be entering the market for health benefits over the next several years and the UnitedHealthcare brand and its capabilities will make it simple and easy for all our customers to understand the value we offer through every stage in life.

measures of service and responsiveness were high and continued to trend upward. Our care provider relationships and clinical programs have never been more consistent, more integrated or offered greater economic value. Our cost and capital management disciplines, strong integration and modernization efforts, and our growth, distribution and market

Our Health Services businesses, under the new Optum brand name, are growing. OptumInsight, OptumHealth and OptumRx delivered combined revenue growth of 15 percent year-over-year. Expanding benefit coverage, increasing government oversight and new legislation are creating needs we can meet for connectivity, expanded care capacity, clinical accountability and transparency, and more consumer affordability. Greater cost pressures are impacting the entire health care system. In 2010, we aligned our Health Services businesses more closely to better serve this huge emerging market among governments, care providers, payers and other participants in the care system. Health Services will not focus on the domestic market alone. Our broad services capabilities are also the leading edge of our company's continuing international expansion.

engagement programs have never been more mature. The time is right to begin to tell our story. We launched Health in Numbers, an image and reputation campaign for UnitedHealth Group, and the initial response has been strongly positive. Our growing role in making the health care system work aligns with our growing and deeper involvement in people's health and health care. That relationship, in such a socially and personally sensitive part of their lives, must be built on trust. We are committed to putting ourselves in the shoes of the people we serve, delivering not only high performance, but compassion and dependability properly matched to the enabling role we will play in the future of this nation's health care. Within each of our businesses, we are redoubling our efforts to develop and promote innovative thinking, along with the processes to efficiently translate new

ideas into scalable reality. The results are new product designs and network and payment approaches, new ways to engage people in their health and health care and drive better consumer choices, and the application of new technology to simplify the health care experience end-to-end for both consumers and care providers. We are building new relationships to help us reach and serve people from different perspectives, like our collaborations with Sesame Street, the YMCA, LPL Financial, the National Restaurant Association, National Football League's New England Patriots franchise, Walgreens and Cisco. This report highlights a number of the innovations we introduced in 2010. Our forward momentum is strong and we are optimistic as we enter 2011 and begin to prepare for continued growth in 2012 and beyond. The next wave of growth opportunities will come to those who fundamentally help make the health care system work better, in a more sustainable way. We believe UnitedHealth Group is well positioned to meet that challenge.

We serve people --we support the health care needs of more than 75 million people in the United States and around the globe and help enable the 14 million people who work in the U.S. health system to do their jobs more effectively, every day. As we address the needs of the people we serve--better and more consistently than other market alternatives--we diversify and grow. UnitedHealth Group has never been better prepared, more engaged or more committed to help people live healthier lives and to advance a positive health care agenda in the United States and worldwide. I would like to thank the people of UnitedHealth Group for their outstanding performance this year in serving our customers. We offer our thanks to you, our shareholders, for your continuing support. Sincerely,

Stephen J. Hemsley President and Chief Executive Officer
