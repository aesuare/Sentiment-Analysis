To the Shareholders and Employees of ADM,

By almost any measure, 2007 was an excellent year for ADM. We delivered our third consecutive year of record earnings and achieved our seventh consecutive year of double digit improvements in safety. We extended our record of uninterrupted dividends to 75 years, and exceeded our targets for costs and returns--two important measures of shareholder value. As good as our numbers are--and in a year marked by unprecedented volatility in commodity markets, they are quite good--the numbers alone do not tell the full story of our accomplishments. For, as we were achieving record results, we were also strengthening our organizational capacity for change and building out the long-term value of our company. Delivering Results In 2007, we demonstrated our ability to deliver growth and returns. Net earnings for the year increased 65% over last year's record performance, to a record $2.2 billion dollars, Patricia A. Woertz, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President or $3.30 per share. Special items were significant in the year-over-year increase, reflecting actions to strategically align our portfolio. Sales revenues surpassed $44 billion, rising 20% primarily on the strength of commodity pricing and on additional sales volumes. Archer Daniels Midland Company We finished the year with a Return on Net Assets of 15.7%, solidly over our 13% objective, and we held costs to below our Cost per Metric Ton of Production objective of less than $110, achieving a rate of $108.89 for the year. In a first for ADM, we issued $1.15 billion of convertible debt. This issuance provided cost-effective funds for a significant buy-back of 15.4 million shares of ADM stock. And we increased our cash dividend payouts, in absolute dollars and in cents per share. With thanks, we offer full credit for this excellent performance to the people of ADM. While continuing to respect and--indeed--relish the traditional strengths of the company, they embraced a new focus, new people and a new set of expectations and disciplines, all the while maintaining an unwavering commitment to delivering quality and value for ADM's customers and shareholders. Their tireless efforts, across the globe, are reflected in the record results they achieved in all of the major segments of our business. Growing Opportunity Last year, as we examined the global landscape to identify future possibilities for our company, we recognized two major world trends that suggested unprecedented, sustained opportunity: the growing demand for food to feed a growing and more prosperous world population, and the quest for alternative fuel sources to supply expanding energy needs. We embraced that opportunity, identifying a longer-term, strategic destination for our company: to be the global leader in BioEnergy while expanding our premiere position in the agricultural processing chain. With this destination firmly in mind, we identified key

areas of focus and investment: diversifying feedstocks, expanding our geographic footprint, advancing BioEnergy projects, and expanding our technology platform as a critical catalyst for all our efforts. We pursued this strategy, with vigor and discipline. We advanced our BioEnergy projects in the U.S. and Brazil, two of the largest markets for biofuels. Our Nebraska ethanol plant, and the cogeneration plant that will provide it a cost-effective energy source, are moving toward completion in 2008, and the Iowa ethanol plant is scheduled to be on line by August 2009. When complete, these plants will increase our U.S. ethanol capacity to 1.65 billion gallons annually, maintaining our position as the largest producer of ethanol in the country. These dry-mill plants, located adjacent to existing wet-mill corn processing plants, exemplify the unique and sustainable advantages ADM holds in BioEnergy. The largest ethanol units in the industry, these plants will be fed by our vast, established origination network, will access existing infrastructure, including the largest ethanol transportation system in the industry and our extensive ethanol terminal network, and will link to our global market for animal feed co-products. We opened two new biodiesel plants in the U.S. and one in Brazil. To support growing demand for vegetable oil for fuel and food needs, we are expanding oilseed crushing capacity at five North American plants. As we position our company for BioEnergy leadership, we understand that the future of our company--and the future of sustainable, renewable fuels--goes beyond here-and-now products, such as today's ethanol and biodiesel. We are evaluating the myriad possible combinations of potential feedstock platforms, conversion technologies and finished products to define the well-focused list of combinations--or roadmap--to which we will commit research and development funding. To advance these efforts, we hired a new chief technology officer, and entered some innovative research alliances, including one with Purdue University to further the commercialization of cellulosic ethanol and one with ConocoPhillips to identify and commercialize second-generation biofuels. ADM's competitive strength, our unique position, derives from our history, expertise and capabilities in serving global needs for both fuel and food, and our strategic direction clearly affirms our intention to do both. In 2007, we announced plans to build a research and development center in Hamburg, Germany, to explore new food and oleochemical technologies, as well as drive improvement and process efficiencies for existing technologies. With this new R&D facility supplementing our current capabilities, we will be better positioned to serve our European food and BioEnergy customers. We modified our Netherlands' soybean crushing facility to process both rapeseed and soybeans, and we built a palm oil refinery at our facility in Hamburg, Germany, which is Europe's largest refinery capable of simultaneously refining rapeseed, soy and palm oils. Our cocoa processing facility in Pennsylvania is progressing on schedule, with a first phase scheduled to be operational in first quarter 2008 and the entire project on line in January 2009. We continue to see opportunity in this segment, and last year acquired Classic Couverture, a U.K.-based chocolate manufacturer. The acquisition provides us an expanded platform for industrial chocolate manufacturing. To supply our growing, global customer needs, we announced plans to build a cocoa processing facility in Kumasi, Ghana. This state-of-the-art facility will diversify and expand our global cocoa origination and processing operations into a strategically important location.

In Clinton, Iowa, construction is underway on ADM's new commercial-scale PHA plant. When operational, the plant will produce 110 million pounds of biobased plastic a year using dextrose from ADM's adjacent wet mill. A new cogeneration plant will provide steam and power for both operations. Using a blend of fuels, including high- and low-sulfur coals, tire-derived fuel and biomass, cogeneration offers ADM a significant cost advantage in ethanol production. We continued to take actions to realign our portfolio with our strategic opportunities. We sold our Arkady bakery ingredient business, as well as our interests in Agricore United, Overseas Shipholding Group and Tyson Foods. We also made progress on our Asia strategy, exchanging our Chinese joint venture interests for shares of Wilmar International Limited, the largest agribusiness company in Asia. The Third Trend While we began 2007 identifying two growing, promising trends, over the course of the year we witnessed a third global trend gain momentum: the demand for environmental improvement. This "green" trend offers further support for our BioEnergy opportunity, which includes biobased products beyond fuel. While the desire for environmental improvement isn't new, as we track policy developments and meet and talk with business and research partners, we recognize a new sense of both urgency and possibility. We believe the sense of urgency is driven, in part, by conclusions in the report issued this year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The panel found that actions we take to control greenhouse gas emissions in the next 10 years are critical to offset the most severe impacts of global warming. Against this sense of urgency is a new sense of possibility, arising from the many biobased alternatives to petroleum-derived products that are moving from the test tube to the factory. In 2007, we broke ground on our own commercial-scale facility to produce biobased plastic. Through our joint venture, TellesTM, we expect to produce 110 million pounds a year of biodegradable, renewable plastic using dextrose. We also advanced plans to build a propylene glycol facility, which will create a renewable alternative to a petroleum-based industrial chemical. And we see further opportunity to produce other Earth-friendly alternatives, such as biobased lubricants and chemicals made from renewable sources. As with biofuel technologies, we are creating a roadmap to evaluate technologies surrounding "green" chemicals and have added additional research expertise to assist in this effort.

For ADM, these possibilities tie to our commitment to be the global leader in BioEnergy. The environmental trend doesn't suggest a new offshoot from our unique position; rather it is a third strong current of change we can chart toward greater success. Building Value As we chart this course, we have worked to get--as we call it--"fit for the journey." We identified our Corporate Priorities--areas where organizational and cultural change offer the ability to achieve significant improvements. Championed by the members of our Strategic Planning Committee, these Priorities renewed and revitalized our commitment to safety; expanded candid, purposeful communication; formalized and enhanced cost management; and defined and tracked key metrics. We hired a new head of Human Resources during the year, bringing strong leadership to our continuing efforts to attract and develop world-class talent. Our shared objective is to create a company where colleagues are inspired to do the best work of their lives. We enter fiscal 2008 with confidence and momentum. We have demonstrated our ability, quarter after quarter, to manage through volatility, challenge and change. And we have confirmed we have the focus and the will to grow opportunity and build value. There are tremendous prospects ahead. Agriculture is responding to the unprecedented opportunities to provide both food and fuel. We see an ample supply of soybeans in the world market. The cocoa market continues to grow. Mexico will likely open the border to high fructose corn syrup. And U.S. farmers responded to market signals by planting a record corn crop. The people of ADM will respond, with characteristic passion, commitment and pride in our business which is so central to the life and wellbeing of so many. I would like to thank our colleagues, directors and shareholders for their support and for the enthusiasm with which they are embracing and creating our future. It is my privilege to build value for you and with you.
