             To our shareholders
2009 was a year of significant achievement for Valspar. We delivered double- digit earnings growth* despite an unprecedented decline in revenues resulting from the global recession.
We strengthened our global operations and maintained our investments in building our brands and developing leading-edge technologies. By remaining focused on our customers, we were able to win new business and grow our share in key markets. We generated strong cash flow and strengthened our balance sheet. The dividend to shareholders was increased for the 32nd consecutive year.
2009 results
Overall, the year unfolded very much along the lines communicated in last year’s Letter to Shareholders. Our global architectural, packaging, automotive refinish and specialty polymer product lines all per- formed well. Our product lines that serve industrial markets faced substantial pressure as a result of
the global recession. We took aggressive actions to reduce the overall cost structure of these operations and all remained profitable – an outstanding result. Our operating discipline and focus on execution enabled us to keep a tight control on expenses and deliver significant productivity improvements in our administrative and manufacturing operations.
The strength of our long-term strategy – building our brands, developing leading-edge technologies and expanding our global presence – was evident in 2009. Higher awareness of the Valspar brand in the United States resulted in increased share and we significantly outperformed the overall market for consumer paint.

                     Technology advancements in many of our product lines resulted in new business and helped to offset the overall decline in sales. And our global infrastructure and technical service capability allowed us to reach additional market segments and customers around the world.
Consistent with our values, we continued our activities to support our employees and communities. We maintained a world-class safety record, performing at a level more than four times better than the aver- age for our industry. We continued to improve the environmental profile of our product portfolio and facilities. We were named National Paint Partner by Habitat for Humanity International. We make our highest quality paint available to all Habitat affiliates in the United States and work with them in Brazil, China, South Africa, Thailand and Vietnam.
Net sales for the year fell 17.3 percent to $2.879 billion, reflecting the impact of the global recession. Sales in our Paints segment declined 4.9 percent. Our North America architectural product line posted increased sales for the year, while the overall paint market declined more than 10 percent. Coatings
segment sales were down 22.9 percent. The perfor- mance of our global packaging product line helped to mitigate the impact of lower revenues in our industrial product lines.
Net income in 2009 totaled $160.2 million, up $9.4 million from $150.8 million in 2008. Adjusted earnings per share excluding certain items increased to $1.77 in 2009, up 12.7 percent from $1.57 in 2008.* Results benefitted from an improved cost- price ratio, higher efficiency in our operations from restructuring and productivity actions, and good control of expenses.
During the year, we reduced our total debt by $42 million and generated $220 million in free cash flow (net operating cash flow less capital spending and dividends), an improvement of $54 million from 2008. The Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend for fiscal 2010 by 7 percent to $0.16 a share. Our reserve liquidity at year end was $608 million, with $420 million available through committed bank credit facilities and $188 million in cash, up from $430 million of reserve liquidity at the end of 2008.

     Director changes
Ian R. Friendly, chief operating officer, U.S. Retail and executive vice president, General Mills, Inc., and Gary E. Hendrickson, president and chief operating officer, The Valspar Corporation, were elected to the Board of Directors. Their valuable experience and business insights will be tremendous assets as we continue to build our brands, develop our technologies and expand our presence in global paint and coatings markets.
We would like to thank Susan Boren and Dick White who will be retiring from the Board in February. Susan has been a Board member for 19 years and served as Lead Director for the past two years. Dick joined the Board in 2000. These two outstanding Directors have represented the interests of Valspar shareholders well, and their perspective and judgment have been greatly appreciated.
Outlook
We enter 2010 expecting modest revenue growth for the year. We assume little improvement in global business conditions and upward pressure on our raw material costs. Our restructuring actions and opera- tional discipline have given us a high degree of operating leverage as global markets stabilize and recover. As we demonstrated in 2009, we are con- fident in our ability to win new business and deliver improved results under challenging conditions.
The investments we have made over the past five years have strengthened our brands, significantly enhanced our portfolio of leading-edge technologies
and expanded our presence in fast-growing markets in Latin America and Asia. Over the next five years, we expect to generate approximately $1 billion in
free cash flow, which we will deploy in a disciplined manner to enhance shareholder value. Looking ahead, our differentiated brands and technologies, together with our healthy generation of cash, provide the foun- dation for strong, consistent returns to shareholders.
Finally, we want to thank Valspar employees around the world for their dedication and commitment to building a successful future for the company.
