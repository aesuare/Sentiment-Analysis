2013 Annual Report

Dear Shareholder,
In 2013, ADI delivered solid profitability and shareholder returns despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment that transpired. While fiscal year 2013 revenue of $2.6 billion was 2% below the prior year, net income increased by 3% and sales in the second half were 6% higher than the first half, which we believe are positive signs for the year ahead. Net income for fiscal year 2013 totaled $673 million. Diluted earnings per share were $2.14, rising slightly from 2012. Cash flow from operations was $912 million, or 35% of revenue; and over $460 million was returned to shareholders, primarily through cash dividends. ADI shareholders earned $1.32 per share in dividends, a 15% increase over the prior year, and the total shareholder return was 28%.

As always, we were guided in 2013 by our long-term strategy to drive superior results through superior innovation. During the year, we sharpened our focus on developing the signal processing systems most critical to our customers, with the highest potential to sustain the returns we expect of our investments. As such, we increased investments in industrial, communications infrastructure, and automotive applications, which together accounted for 85% of our revenue in fiscal year 2013. We also increased investments in the advanced technologies that we believe will secure ADI's leadership position far into the future. These increases were primarily achieved by redirecting resources, enabling us to keep expenses under tight control in the uncertain economic climate.

During 2013, ADI was recognized by many of our customers for providing the industry-leading technology, quality and reliability that make high performance, mission critical applications possible. In one notable example, a world leading provider of telecommunications equipment singled out ADI as its "Supplier of the Year," citing ADI's cutting edge technology and consistent and excellent support at every level, and describing ADI as the very definition of what it means to be a collaborative supplier. In 2013, ADI's EngineerZone® technical support community received top honors from Forrester Research, Inc., a global research and advisory firm, for outstanding use of social media to engage customers in technical design support, thereby increasing customer loyalty and value. In the EngineerZone® community, our technical support expertise is accessible to engineers all over the world, all the time, and in an interactive way. And Thomson-Reuters included ADI for the third consecutive year in its prestigious list of the Top 100 Global Innovators. In every aspect of our business, by focusing on driving superior results through superior innovation, we are uncovering new sources of growth and value creation, and proving that the cycle of innovation that has fueled the ADI franchise for decades will continue to fuel our prosperity in the future. The cycle begins by attracting and nurturing the best engineering minds who create superior innovations with high value for customers and high profits for ADI. Strong profitability and financial performance then affords us the flexibility and stability, regardless of the cyclicality of our industry, to continue the cycle by attracting and nurturing top talent and building superior innovations.

Few worked harder than the late Jerry Fishman to nurture the culture of innovation that Ray Stata founded at ADI. Jerry led ADI as CEO from 1996 to 2013, was an employee since 1974, and was my mentor and friend for many years. I know that long into the future I will continue to draw deeply on the learning that he imparted to me as I challenge our people to reach ever increasing levels of performance. This year we made steady progress executing against our long-term plan to grow sales, earn extraordinary profits, and use our cash generation to increase shareholder returns. Tremendous opportunities lie ahead for our great company. ADI provides an essential technology portfolio that enables pervasive sensing, automation, and communication across myriad applications that can improve how businesses operate and people live. Our brand is stronger than ever and our capabilities more complete and more focused, providing us a great platform on which to keep building. I firmly believe that our best is yet to come. Sincerely,
