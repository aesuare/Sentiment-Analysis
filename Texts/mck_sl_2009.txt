To Our Stockholders:
McKesson performed very well in fiscal year 2009, despite the severe economic downturn. We grew revenues 5% to a record $106.6 billion and responded to the economic crisis with foresight and discipline to extend our track record of outstanding financial results.
Our ability to navigate the challenging environment underscores the strength of our Company and the markets we serve. While not immune to the short-term effects of this downturn, most of our businesses executed extremely well, and I continue to be very optimistic about our long-term prospects due to our leadership in an attractive industry. Our Distribution Solutions segment, which includes the largest pharmaceutical wholesale business in North America, is a tremendous generator of cash and a solid performer. In Technology Solutions, we have one of the broadest, most diversified healthcare information technology businesses in the United States.

Extending Our Legacy of Strong Performance In the Annual Report that follows this letter, you will find details of our fiscal year 2009 results by business and customer segment. The following are a few highlights that illustrate the progress we made across the Company last year:
· Executed a balanced capital deployment strategy to
create additional stockholder value. We generated $1.4 billion in operating cash, ending the year with a cash balance of more than $2.1 billion. Though we slowed our capital deployment due to the economic environment, we repurchased $484 million of McKesson stock, committed $358 million to strategic acquisitions, made $392 million in internal capital investments, and paid stockholders $116 million in dividends.

· Took key steps to expand in higher-margin segments.
Our acquisition of regional distributor McQueary Brothers helped us increase our market share in the retail independent pharmacy market. Further, we continued to grow our Health Mart ® franchise, which is now one of the largest pharmacy networks in the United States, numbering more than 2,000 stores.

· Enhanced our competitive position in Canada.
We continued to extend our market leadership in Canada with our banner strategy, which allows independent pharmacies to remain independently owned while achieving the scale and benefits of a larger chain. We also took advantage of McKesson's global purchasing scale to deliver value to customers and improve margins in our Canadian distribution business.

· Renewed key customer accounts and expanded our
solution footprint. We retained all of our national retail pharmacy customers, who increasingly benefit from our broad array of services, from pharmacy systems and centralized fulfillment, to claims processing, automation, and many other solutions designed to meet their specialized needs.

· Used our distribution infrastructure and expertise to
expand into adjacent markets. With the launch of McKesson Plasma and Biologics, we are now providing plasma and related biologic products to our hospital, specialty pharmacy, and physician practice customers, creating new opportunities for our distribution business.

· Built our lead in the generic pharmaceutical market.
In a year in which the generics market grew 6% according to IMS Health, sales in the proprietary McKesson OneStop Generics SM program rose 35%. This performance further supports our leadership in generics, which account for more than 70% of all prescriptions written in the United States.

· Expanded our position in the fast-growing specialty
marketplace. We completed the integration of McKesson Specialty Care Solutions and Oncology Therapeutics Network, positioning McKesson as one of the leading distributors in the rapidly growing specialty-biotech marketplace.

· Strengthened our relationships with suppliers, further
improving the stability and predictability of our earnings. We have excellent relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and compensation under our agreements with our supplier partners showed a solid increase year-over-year.

· Leveraged our solid base of stable and recurring revenues in Technology Solutions to mitigate the effects of the slowing economy. The steady subscription revenues we receive from our payor customers, our RelayHealth® connectivity business, and our revenue cycle outsourcing business helped mitigate the impact of the economic slowdown on this business. Additionally, with our large customer base, we were able to generate stable revenues from maintenance on our installed solutions.

Excluding the impact of the AWP litigation, McKesson recorded diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.07 in fiscal year 2009, an increase of 23% from the prior year, and the first time we have ever reported EPS from continuing operations above $4.00. Reaching this milestone in a challenging economic climate is particularly significant.

Seizing the Long-Term Opportunities
I continue to be extremely optimistic about the future of our business. There are many trends favoring healthcare today, none more significant than the movement toward healthcare reform in the United States. While many decisions are still to come, the current debate is focused on expanding access, while improving the quality and lowering the cost of healthcare. All of these trends create great opportunities for McKesson. For starters, the stimulus bill proposed by President Obama's administration and passed by the U.S. Congress contains $19 billion in incentives for the adoption of healthcare information technology (HIT) solutions. The government and industry leaders have advocated a wider use of HIT for years, and it is exciting to see meaningful funding pledged to this effort. McKesson not only has the technology solutions our customers need to improve the quality and efficiency of care, we also stand ready to help them navigate the process of qualifying to receive stimulus funds. Another tenet of President Obama's healthcare plan aims to provide care to the estimated 47 million uninsured Americans. This is a much tougher problem to solve, but the direction of change clearly points toward a larger healthcare marketplace. As a leading provider of healthcare services and information technology, we are well positioned to benefit from an increased focus on health and wellness in the United States, and across the globe.

· Continued to create new growth opportunities through
innovation. We filed patent applications for 75 inventions in fiscal year 2009. Each of these innovations is designed to advance the success of our customers, while creating new revenue opportunities for McKesson.

Navigating Short-Term Challenges
While we clearly saw many highlights in fiscal year 2009, we began to feel the effects of the worsening economy last fall, as did most companies in healthcare and other industries. These effects included delayed technology purchases by some customers and a general easing of growth rates across the industry as the year progressed. We responded to these developments by managing expenses in disciplined and innovative ways, including cost containment initiatives and our Global Sourcing program, where we coordinate and optimize purchasing across our various businesses and geographic locations. Over the past fiscal year, we also addressed a challenge unrelated to the economic climate. Last November, we agreed to settle all private-party claims relating to First DataBank's published drug reimbursement benchmarks, commonly referred to as Average Wholesale Prices (AWP). While we firmly believe we did nothing wrong in this matter, we felt that given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, entering into the settlement agreement was in the best interests of our stockholders, customers, suppliers, and employees.

Summary and Outlook
On balance, I am very pleased with McKesson's performance in fiscal year 2009. Our ability to achieve our financial goals in the midst of significant economic turmoil is a testament to our unwavering focus on the success of our customers, the quality of our management team, the strength of our products and services, our financial stability, and the hard work and dedication of our employees worldwide. I am disappointed, however, that our strong financial performance in fiscal year 2009 was not reflected in the returns generated for our stockholders. While some short-term headwinds are driving a moderated view of growth prospects for fiscal year 2010, the long-term fundamentals of our business are as strong as ever, and I'm confident that we'll manage through the current economic downturn and continue our industryleading performance. The coming years will bring significant change to healthcare, and we are uniquely qualified to make a difference through our unparalleled capabilities, longstanding customer relationships, and strong competitive position in the markets we serve. We are helping to transform a fragmented industry into a more connected system, where healthcare is higher quality, more efficient, more personalized, and ultimately, more human. Through this pursuit, we will continue to create exceptional value for our customers, our suppliers, and you, our stockholders. On behalf of the board of directors and McKesson's 32,500 employees worldwide, I thank you for your confidence and continued support.
