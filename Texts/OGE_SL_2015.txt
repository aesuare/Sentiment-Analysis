OGE Energy Corp.
OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE: OGE), is headquartered in Oklahoma City and is the parent company of Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company (OG&E), a regulated electric utility serving approximately 825,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. In addition, OGE holds 26.3 percent limited partner interest and 50 percent general partner interest in Enable Midstream Partners, LP.
With about 6,800 megawatts of capacity, OG&E generates electricity using low-sulphur coal, natural gas, wind and solar. OG&E’s transmission and distribution systems span 30,000 square miles.
  I’m proud to share the results
of OGE’s 2015 United Way campaign. Our company and our members contributed nearly $1.2million to hundreds of
partner agencies that improve the health, safety,
  education and economic well- being of families in Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Sean Trauschke
Chairman, President and CEO
We define our purpose in many ways—each rooted in our values and beliefs. Growing share- holder value. Strengthening our communities. Protecting customers’ bills. Maintaining reliability. Inspiring innovative new product offerings.
We are in a noble business—providing electricity to families and communities. It’s our responsibility to do the right things, keeping rates low and service high, while growing the company for the benefit of our communities, shareholders and employees—whom we call members. I’m extremely proud of how our members stayed focused on our goals in 2015. We had a few challenges, but we didn’t let the challenges define who we are and what our purpose is, and as a result we accomplished a great deal in 2015.
Strength in numbers
Your company is in a strong financial position. We achieved 2015 earnings of $1.36 per average diluted share, and according to plan, increased your annual dividend 10 percent, to $1.10 per share. Our forecast is to continue growing the dividend 10 percent annually through 2019, which outpaces the utility group average of 5 percent. At the utility, we’re committed to our forecasted long-term earnings growth of 3 to 5 percent.
OGE’s interest in Enable Midstream Partners continues to provide a source of cash that is helping us fund our dividend growth and capital investments, despite lower commodity prices and reduced drilling activity.
Our key results and strategic objectives are aligned not only with the expectations of shareholders, but also with OG&E’s customers. This balance is critical as we create value for both customers and shareholders. That is why we work so hard to control costs. As a point of reference, our operations and maintenance cost per customer is lower today than it was in 2011.
Perseverance to move forward
Our commitment to do the right thing has helped us persevere through disap- pointing environmental rulings in the Oklahoma regulatory arena. Firm in our belief that fuel diversity is right for our customers, we continue to seek Corporation Commission approval for our plan to install environmental controls—commonly known as scrubbers—to the coal units at our Sooner power plant. The hearing begins in April. We have asked for a ruling by May 2 so we can move forward and meet EPA deadlines with a greater sense of certainty.
Meanwhile, I’m pleased to report the Arkansas Public Service Commission in December approved our request to recover costs associated with the environ- mental mandates. That ruling included costs for the installation of emissions- reducing low NOx burners through April 2015, and we will make additional filings to recover future costs.

Letter To Shareholders continued
 Despite uncertainty, our members remained focused on working safely and pro- viding reliable electricity from our power plants all the way to the customer’s meter. In 2015, our combined cycle fleet achieved top quartile performance. And while our electric distribution system was tested by record-breaking rainfall in May, and again during back-to-back ice storms at year end, our system performed well, and our smart grid technology enabled us to improve the timeliness and efficiency of our response.
Enhancing customer experiences
In 2015, we launched the first phase of a customer outage communications program and made improvements in reliability and responsiveness. Our customers noticed, and we achieved a rare accomplishment: a third consecutive no. 1 ranking in the J.D. Power Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction StudySM.
Since 2012, customers have said “count on me” more than 360,000 times by participating in SmartHours, weatherization, paperless billing and other programs to save energy and money. We call this partnership Positive Energy Together, and it has saved more than 400 million kilowatt-hours of energy and more than 200 megawatts of peak demand reduction.
We serve more than 800,000 customers, each with unique interests, including solar power. Last summer, we became the first in Oklahoma to launch universal solar power with a pilot program that helps us understand the operating charac- teristics of solar and its impact on our system.
Commitment to innovation, reliability and bill protection
For 2016, we are focused on exciting and innovative strategic initiatives including geothermal heat pumps, outage protection and a phased migration to LED street lighting. We’re also increasing awareness and interest in electric vehicles.
We are improving processes and reducing costs in order to protect our customers’ bills, because we believe low rates and high reliability benefit our current customers and help to attract new ones.
Lastly, our company would not be complete without giving back to our communities. This is a hallmark of OGE, and I am so proud of our contributions to United Way and other organizations, as well as the thousands of hours our members spend volunteering to make our communities strong.
I am humbled and honored to have taken the reins of this great company. To continue its success, I have called on all members to stay engaged, and to pursue each objective with a sense of purpose. The skills each of them has individually are strong. I want to harness those skills in a culture of positive values and beliefs so that we rise to a level greater than our individual contributions.
Thank you for your interest in OGE Energy and for being a shareholder.

Chairman, President and CEO
Point of pride
For the third consecutive
year, OG&E ranked highest in customer satisfaction in the
J.D. Power and Associates’
2015 Electrical Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction StudySM among large utilities in the South.
Thank you to former Chairman, Pete Delaney, who led OGE Energy Corp. from September 2007 until his retire- ment in 2015. During his tenure, the company celebrated many successes, including being named the 2011 North American Utility of the Year and in 2013 receiving the Edison Award, the industry’s most prestigious honor.
“We wish Pete the very best and offer him a collective ‘thank you’ for all he did for this company and our communities.”—Sean Trauschke
