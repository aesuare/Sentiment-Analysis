To Our Shareholders
For years to come, we will look back upon 2006 as the year we created a compelling new future for your Company.
We delivered on our strategy, achieved our performance objectives and identified significant opportunities to accelerate our growth and increase the value we deliver to shareholders. We seized those opportunities, entering into three major strategic transactions that will, in total, reshape this Company and reinvigorate our capacity for growth and profitability. Guiding each of these actions was a clear vision of our future potential to help clients succeed in the world's rapidly evolving global markets. In pursuit of that vision, we seek to focus exclusively on securities servicing and asset management. These are businesses where we have the scale, skill and technological advantage to compete successfully, operate efficiently and capitalize on favorable growth trends. Each of these actions brings us closer to realizing that vision. Together, we are confident these actions will create a new, more powerful global financial services growth company that is a leader and catalyst in the evolution of our industry ­ a company that delivers excel lent service and value, supports a talented and engaged workforce and provides superior returns for shareholders. Corporate Trust Expansion ­ Enhancing the Business Mix In the first of three milestones in 2006, we acquired JPMorgan Chase's corporate trust franchise in exchange for our retail and regional middle-market banking business, a transaction we completed in October. Through this transaction we exchanged a lower-growth business for one that is high-growth, generates high margins and is supported by strong secular trends. The long-term shift away from bank-sourced to capital-markets-based financing is accelerating around the world. In addition, new and increasingly sophisticated and innovative debt instruments are gaining acceptance. These trends create strong growth dynamics that we believe are sustainable and will increase demand for the value-added corporate trust services we offer globally. As a result of the swap transaction, we are now the clear leader in global corporate trust and have greatly expanded our presence in international and structured debt, which are the fastest-growing segments of the corporate trust market. BNY ConvergEx Group Next, we formed BNY ConvergEx Group, LLC, an entrepreneurial firm that harnesses the powerful and complementary institutional trading and investment tech nology offerings from our organization and Eze Castle Software to propel growth in a dynamic marketplace. BNY ConvergEx Group also enjoys an efficient and flexible capital structure to support its future growth. BNY ConvergEx Group joined our trade execution, commission management, independent research and transition management businesses with Eze Castle Software's leading order-management capabilities. This combination immediately expanded our product offering and enhanced our positioning in the market, particularly with hedge funds, where Eze Castle Software has been a leading provider. GTCR Golder Rauner, LLC, a private equity firm, is a partner in this venture. The new company was launched in October as an affiliate of The Bank of New York, which retains 35.4% ownership. Merger Agreement with Mellon These two transactions helped set the stage for the year's defining transformational event: our agreement in December to merge with Mellon Financial Corporation to create the largest securities servicing and asset management firm globally. This transaction will combine two powerful franchises with leadership positions in a wide array of complementary businesses and leading client service scores in asset servicing, wealth management, and issuer, clearing and treasury services. Together, once the merger is complete,

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation will have the scale, the technology, the capital and the people we need to compete and win in the rapidly expanding global marketplace. This proposed merger is groundbreaking from both a strategic and a financial perspective. Strategically speaking, we believe the combination will deepen and expand the capabilities of both compa nies and give us a stronger capital base. The Bank of New York and Mellon are an extraordinarily good fit in terms of our cultures, capabilities and commitment to securities servicing and asset management. We will bring to Mellon leadership and capabilities in global corporate trust, depositary receipts, broker-dealer services and correspon dent clearing. Mellon will expand our presence in asset management and wealth management, as it is among the top 10 global asset managers and has a national private wealth management franchise in the United States. These are areas that we have been eager to expand to capitalize on favorable growth characteristics, profit margins and revenue dynamics. In other areas each organization has a successful franchise with unique strengths. These include investor services, foreign exchange, securities lending, global payments and stock transfer. By combining our franchises we expect to achieve greater benefits of scale and provide clients with a richer, more powerful offering. Financially, once the merger is complete it will be quickly and strongly cash-accretive to shareholders of both companies and offer substantial cost and revenue synergies. The combined company is expected to have annual revenues of more than $12 billion, with asset manage ment and asset servicing contributing nearly one-third

each and issuer services, treasury services and clearing services comprising the remainder. More than a quarter of combined revenue will be derived internationally. The Bank of New York Mellon will be poised to capitalize on global growth trends, including the evolution of emerging markets, the growth of hedge funds and alternative asset classes, the increasing need for more complex financial products and services, and the growing demand for retirement planning among consumers worldwide. We anticipate that the proposed merger will result in better service and value for clients, more rewarding opportunities for our staff and superior returns for you, our shareholders. The transaction has been unanimously approved by each company's board of directors and is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2007, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals. Performance Highlights As these transformative actions unfolded, we continued to deliver solid, consistent operating performance highlighted by success in growing the top line and delivering the inherent operating leverage our model offers. For the full year 2006, net income was $3.01 billion and diluted earnings per share were $3.93. This record level includes the gain on the sale of the retail and middle-market businesses. On an adjusted basis, excluding merger and integration costs and the gain on sale, diluted earnings per share were $2.26, an increase of more than 11% over $2.03 in 2005, and net income was $1.73 billion, compared with $1.57 billion last year. All capital ratios remained at or above target levels and the Company delivered outstanding credit quality with historically low credit costs. Our strong, broad-based

financial performance enabled us to again increase our quarterly dividend. Our results demonstrated the power of our business model and our ability to capitalize on the increased globalization of financial markets and asset flows. Let me isolate a few key metrics that illustrate how we benefited from heightened market activity in 2006, starting with cross-border assets under custody, which were up 38% from 2005, compared to total assets under custody, which grew 19%. Cross-border assets now represent over 36% of total assets under custody, a percentage that continues to steadily increase. The depositary receipt marketplace is another helpful barometer. Here, U.S. trading volumes and values were up 34% and 50%, respectively, reflecting the continued growth of crossborder investing activity and contributing to another record year for our depositary receipt business. Each of our business lines is global, positioning us to benefit from this secular trend for years to come. One of America's Most Admired Banks In 2006 The Bank of New York ranked first in our category in Fortune's list of America's Most Admired Companies, an annual report card on corporate reputations. The list reflects the input of executives, directors and analysts in our industry who evaluated us alongside our competitors on eight key attributes: quality of management; quality of products and services; innovation; long-term investment value; financial soundness; ability to attract, develop and keep talented people; social responsibility; and use of corporate assets. This mark of distinction validates that we are upholding our commitment to do right by our clients, employees, shareholders and the community at large.

This top ranking was just one of many awards and recognitions received during the year. A Promising Outlook We entered 2007 with great momentum, a strengthened business profile and a generally favorable environment. Given those factors, along with our pending merger with Mellon and our demonstrated success in executing our strategic and financial goals, we have greater confidence in our ability to achieve strong results this year and beyond. Our strong strategic progress and financial perform ance in 2006 reflect the leadership, guidance and service of our Board of Directors. We offer our gratitude and best wishes to John C. Malone and Brian L. Roberts, who will not stand for re-election to the Board after 21 and 8 years of service, respectively. On behalf of our Board of Directors and senior management, I wish to offer my appreciation to the people of The Bank of New York. They work diligently each and every day so that we can realize the full potential of our vision for the benefit of our clients, communities and shareholders. We look forward to delivering on the promise of our more powerful franchise.
