Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
In the United States, two major initiatives contributed
3 percentage points to our 6 percent sales growth: Market Expansion and Product Line Expansion. Our Market Expansion team completed 43 projects in 18 expansion markets, realigning our branch and sales presence, improving inventory availability and enhancing merchandising. This program is rejuvenating our presence in the top U.S. metropolitan markets. We also launched the largest product expansion in our company’s history, adding about 43,000 products to our offering. We are continuing to invest in these initiatives in 2007 because they enhance our ability to serve customers in the U.S. Branch-based Business and represent catalysts for growth.
Other areas of the business also contributed to the company’s growth:
• Our Canadian operation, Acklands – Grainger, increased sales by 13 percent. In 2006, a newly strengthened management team and greater integration with our U.S. operations spurred improvements in service and financial performance. Acklands – Grainger’s profitability remains a priority for 2007.
• The Mexican business grew 20 percent, adding two new branches. We expect to open several more Mexican branches in 2007 to serve our customers even better.
• Three acquisitions contributed to Lab Safety Supply’s 8 percent growth in 2006. Early in the year, Lab acquired the business of Rand Materials Handling Equipment Company, and at year-end, purchased Professional Inspection Equipment and Construction Book Express, two direct marketing businesses serving the engineering and construction industries. Acquisitions continue to be the most effective way to expand and diversify Lab’s customer base and product offering and will remain a primary growth strategy.
• In 2006, we also extended our reach into China, one of the most vibrant economies in the world. We opened two locations, including
a 120,000 square-foot facility in Shanghai, and launched a Chinese-language catalog and Web site to serve the city’s $2 billion maintenance, repair and operating supply market. China holds tremendous long-term growth potential for Grainger. The country’s market for facilities maintenance supplies is approximately $38 billion today and is expected to grow to more than $70 billion by 2014. Grainger intends to capture share by offering the same value to Chinese customers as we do in North America.
Improving productivity and shareholder value
After months of testing and training, we installed SAP, our enterprise resource planning system, across the majority of our U.S. operations in a single weekend in early 2006. The team collectively held its breath while the first order came through at 4 a.m. from a Pennsylvania hospital. It processed flawlessly, a testament to our meticulous preparation and committed employees. We fine-tuned the system throughout 2006. In 2007, we expect to gain more efficiencies and optimize its benefits.
By increasing sales, improving our productivity and paying attention to working capital, Grainger continues to be a strong cash generator. In 2006, we derived $437 million in cash from operations

  To our shareholders:
Last May, Chicago Scenic Studios called our Morton Grove, Ill., branch in a panic because several pieces of their lighting equipment were malfunctioning. They needed replacements – fast – so that the lights could be used that night for a network television program. Customer Service Manager John Fildew and the team sprang into action, setting up an emergency will-call order. When the customer arrived at the branch, the items were ready and waiting. With Grainger’s help, the show did, in fact, go on.
Our associates handle issues like this more than 110,000 times a day, most frequently addressing repair or maintenance needs. There’s little opportunity to create primary demand and most of
our customers have encountered a problem that requires a solution right away. Customers come back to us because Grainger offers unbeatable solutions – the combination of a broad product line available locally and knowledgeable employees with a passion
for service.
Driving our growth
Record sales of $5.9 billion in 2006, an increase of 6 percent versus 2005, came from guiding some 1.8 million customers to the right solutions from among the hundreds of thousands of products we offer. Doing this efficiently resulted in net earnings of $383 million, or $4.24 per share. Compared to 2005, net earnings increased 11 percent and earnings per share were up 12 percent.

and invested it in the business through capital expenditures totaling $137 million. We also returned cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases ($473 million) and dividends ($98 million). We are one of only 25 companies in the S&P 500 to increase dividends each year for 35 years or more.
We created additional shareholder value in 2006 by increasing our pretax return on invested capital (ROIC) to 26.4 percent versus 25.5 percent in 2005.
Engaging in our communities
While helping our customers and creating value for our shareholders remain top of mind, we never lose sight of the communities in which we operate. For many years Grainger has been a leader in helping communities deal with disasters. In July 2006, we announced
our national sponsorship of Ready When the Time Comes, an American Red Cross program that helps local Red Cross chapters reach and train corporate volunteers in disaster relief. Those employees are then ready to help in the event of a local or national disaster. In 2007, Grainger is working with chapters in Baltimore, Houston, Kansas City, New York, Orange County (California), San Francisco and St. Louis to help them respond to emergencies. Grainger employees are usually among the first volunteers.
Preparing for the future
Your company has demonstrated the ability to grow sales and improve returns over the past five years. And we did this while investing in the business, creating a strong foundation for long-term growth. As I look forward to 2007, I am excited by the opportunities ahead and confident that with our business model, our scale and our financial strength, we will continue our momentum.
To help lead the charge, in February 2007 President
James T. Ryan added the additional title and responsibilities of Chief Operating Officer and became a member of the board. The board also promoted Y.C. Chen to President of our U.S. Branch- based Business. Both have been with Grainger for many years and have proven track records of achieving their goals.
We are going to miss David W. Grainger, Senior Chairman of the Board, who has decided not to stand for election in April 2007 after 54 years on the board. He remains Senior Chairman of the company, however, and will continue to provide us with his wisdom and judgment based on more than 55 years of experience with Grainger.
Customers have depended on Grainger for 80 years. We are proud of this heritage and will continue to build on our long tradition of service. We know we will succeed as long as we never lose sight of our customers. They have many faces, many needs – and we’re there for them every day.
Thank you for your support.
