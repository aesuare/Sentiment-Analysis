-- Our customer promise

To Our Stockholders
Living up to our promises -- something we all learned when we were young -- seems to get more complicated as we grow up. But regardless of how difficult it becomes, keeping promises is essential to the success of any business -- especially to ours. Our strategic plans at Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air revolve around living up to our promises to all our stakeholders. When customers buy tickets on our airlines, they expect us to get them where they want to go safely, on time and with their bags. Our employees trust us to provide good jobs with fair, market-based compensation and to make good on our retirement funding obligations. And we believe there is an implicit, if not explicit, promise to provide investors a reasonable return over the long term. Keeping these core promises is foundational to our future success. But let's be frank. We haven't always delivered. Our industry as a whole has struggled and some airlines have outright failed to live up to their promises over the past few years. There are plenty of excuses to go around, but to customers who missed important meetings or family

gatherings, employees forced to change major life plans because they lost a portion of their hard-earned retirement incomes, and stockholders who lost their investments -- excuses simply don't matter. While some things, such as soaring fuel prices and a sluggish economy, are out of our direct control, we decide how we're going to respond to circumstances that present themselves. And it's the sum of those decisions that determines our ultimate success or failure over the long term. Let's look at how we performed in 2007 and what we're doing in 2008 to better position ourselves to live up to our promises.

Financial Results
At $92.3 million, or $2.28 per diluted share, Alaska Air Group's 2007 adjusted net income fell short of our plan and lagged our 2006 results. The primary reason was the significant rise in the cost of fuel combined with our inability to pass along those added costs through higher fares in the current competitive and economic environment.

Airlines have many moving parts, but when you boil it down, there are just two main drivers of profitability -- what it costs to provide our service and what our customers pay for it.

Costs
In 2007, we succeeded in lowering Alaska's non-fuel unit costs (CASM excluding fuel) by 3.2 percent. CASM excluding fuel for Horizon was up 2.8 percent, and if you exclude the costs associated with fleet transition, Horizon's unit costs increased only 0.3 percent last year. (To provide some perspective, Alaska's mainline operation accounted for about 80 percent of Alaska Air Group's $3.5 billion in total revenues

We're proud of the progress we've made lowering our non-fuel unit costs. During the past six years we've achieved $298 million in annual reductions at Alaska Airlines and $174 million at Horizon Air (measured in terms of 2007 available seat miles). But we're not yet where we need to be, and we have several initiatives underway that will help us continue to lower these costs, not the least of which is completing Alaska's transition to a single 737 fleet type later this year and Horizon's transition out of smaller, less-efficient Q200s in 2009.

We plan to replace the 37-seat Q200s with 76-seat Q400s. The Q400 provides twice as many seats for just a third more in operating cost, resulting in significantly lower unit costs. Lower unit costs mean we can offer lower fares and stimulate new traffic in some of our markets, such as the SeattlePortland shuttle where our primary competition is the automobile.

handling performance in Seattle and are already beginning to see results from some of the changes we've made. At Horizon, where an unusually high level of planned maintenance contributed to a cost "bubble" in 2007, we are working hard to operate more efficiently and improve our cost structure. The rising price of fuel has presented its own set of challenges. With crude oil at $65 per barrel in March 2007, who would have guessed we'd be looking at $100 or more per barrel just one year later. Fuel is now our largest expense, accounting for 28 percent of Alaska Air Group's total operating expense on an economic basis in 2007. And even though Alaska was able to grow while consuming the same amount of fuel as the year before (through our transition to more fuel-efficient 737-800s), the airline's fuel bill still rose by about $145 million in 2007 -- and that's after a $53.4 million benefit from our fuel hedges. Of course, the best way to control our fuel expense is to not burn it in the first place. Completing Alaska's fleet transition later this year means we will have one of the lowest fuel costs per available seat mile in the industry at a time when it matters most. And Horizon's fleet changes will translate into better fuel efficiency, as well.

We're striving to make our operation as efficient as possible to better serve our customers, and this year we are making some significant investments at Alaska and Horizon that will lay the foundation for long-term service and cost benefits. We are focused on improving Alaska's on-time and baggage-

We are conserving fuel in other ways, too. For example, by the end of this year almost all our Next-Generation aircraft will have winglets, which reduce fuel burn by about 3 percent. We've also developed "Required Navigation Performance" (RNP) procedures that save both fuel and time through more direct flight routings, allow us to perform constant-descent approaches, and decrease the need to over fly destinations due to inclement weather. Last year, the RNP approaches we developed kept us from having to divert more than 1,200 arrivals as a result of weather, saving an estimated $8 million in the process. These and other fuel-saving initiatives significantly reduce our emissions, as well.

Revenues
It's no secret that Alaska and Horizon serve some markets where ticket prices do not reflect the true cost of providing the service. With the fuel cost increases we've seen over the past couple of years -- and especially during early 2008 -- fares need to keep pace or profits will continue to decline. As the industry adjusts to recoup its cost of doing business, we're working to increase total revenues while providing our customers with the services they value most.

One way we're doing that is by tailoring frequency and size of aircraft to better match demand. For example, on certain routes where a 737 jet is too large to fly a convenient schedule profitably, Horizon can serve the market with a 70-seat CRJ under contract with Alaska. We are exploring alternatives to further improve the profitability of Alaska's "capacity-purchase" routes, such as replacing CRJ flying with a more fuel-efficient Q400, reducing the number of flights in a given market, or possibly contracting with a third party on a few routes if we determine that would be optimal for the market.

Some of the changes we've made not only provide added customer value, but they also lower our costs. For instance, our Web site now allows customers to receive answers to their questions from a virtual agent and easily change existing reservations. And our Airport of the Future -- which we pioneered in Anchorage several years ago and introduced in Seattle late last year -- cuts check-in time in half. That's a boon for travelers and a way to serve more customers without requiring additional airport space.

Customers won't pay for something they don't value. That's why we listen when our customers tell us what they like and don't like. One of the things our customers tell us they like very much is Alaska's Mileage Plan, which allows members to fly all over the world and has been voted a favorite among travelers year after year. Customers appreciate Horizon's unique brand of Pacific Northwest service, too, evidenced by the fact that Air Transport World named Horizon 2007 Regional Airline of the Year. Our flight schedules (including shuttle-like service between Seattle and several West Coast business centers), seat selection, Alaska's firstclass cabin, high-quality onboard food and beverage offerings, and award-winning service at both carriers are all reasons our customers keep coming back. This year, we're looking forward to offering Alaska travelers onboard Internet connectivity through our partnership with a company called Row 44. All these features, along with our strong West Coast network, give us a clear advantage over the competition. Speaking of our network, in 2007 Alaska began service from Seattle and Anchorage to Honolulu and from Seattle to Kauai. And Horizon added

Delivering more than we promise
Frequent travelers on Alaska and Horizon have come to expect something special in the delivery of our core promises. Because our employees genuinely care about people, our customers are rarely disappointed. I'm proud of what our people do day in and day out and want to share just a couple of examples with you. Tommy, one of our younger passengers, was flying with his family from Orlando to Seattle to undergo treatment for systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. During the trip he met Alaska Flight Attendant Diane Euting. Right away, Diane saw an opportunity to make the best of a trying time for a family very far from home. Diane called a store near the hospital and arranged for food and flowers to be waiting for them upon their arrival. During their stay, she collected games, books and a DVD player for their use, arranged for Tommy's three siblings to come to Seattle so they could be together as a family, and kept tabs on Tommy's progress throughout the summer. Recently, a Horizon flight from Los Angeles to Eugene was canceled and all the passengers were re-routed on other flights. A few of the bags had to be sent on a different flight that arrived later, including the bags belonging to two men who were scheduled to play golf the next day on the coast, a couple hours' drive from Eugene. Unfortunately, the luggage arrived too late for delivery to the two golfers before they had to leave. Aware that one of the bags contained needed medication, Eugene Customer Services Manager Mel Frost-Gorman got up Sunday morning and drove her own car to the coast to deliver them personally.

Diane and Mel are just two of the many Alaska and Horizon employees whose genuine compassion and care for people go beyond what is expected and truly make a difference to the people we serve.

Shareholder Returns
In September 2007, our board of directors authorized a $100 million stock buy-back. At the end of February 2008, we completed that program, which resulted in the repurchase of about 10 percent of our outstanding stock. In March, we announced a second buy-back program, this time for $50 million. Given our strong cash position, we can think of no better way to demonstrate our belief in the long-term value of our company. And there is nothing we could do in today's environment that has more impact for our stockholders than buying back our stock at today's prices.

ranging from a modest profit to a loss on par with the post-9/11 downturn. But we are optimistic. Market forces will inevitably bring revenues and costs back in line with each other. In the meantime, our healthy balance sheet, young, fuel-efficient fleets, strategic alliances, solid brand reputations and, above all, the exceptional customer experience our people provide, put us in a very good position not only to weather the current economic storm but to keep our promises in the process. Sincerely,

What's Ahead?
