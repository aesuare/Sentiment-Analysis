Visteon Shareholdesr
In 2013, we made great strides in executing the
strategic plan that the company first articulated in
September 2012. The company's strong results
show that the strategy is creating value for our
customers, and for you, the owners of Visteon.
Equally important, Visteon has built a foundation
for future success by focusing on vehicle climate
control and cockpit electronics, two strong core
product lines in expanding market segments.
When I became chairman in October 2012, and
Tim Leuliette became permanent president and
CEO, one of our top priorities was to bring clarity
regarding our vision to customers and investors –
so they could see the same promise in Visteon's
global assets as we did. The company's
value-creating plan was ambitious and
challenging. Under Tim's leadership, Visteon has
moved ahead rapidly with exiting the parts of the
business that were complex or non-core, while
consolidating those segments critical to its future.
Today, as a result, Visteon is beginning to
perform at a level associated with premier
companies, validating our belief in the company
and its employees.
Visteon employees have continued to perform
magnificently. In the face of major and constant
transformation, they have delivered great
products at lower costs, with world-class quality
and a safety record that few peer companies can
match. I thank them for their efforts and for their
results.
I am very proud of what Visteon accomplished in
2013. There is still much more to do as we now
focus on growing our core value-creating climate
and electronics businesses. With a strong
leadership team, an engaged board of directors,
and a team of talented, dedicated employees
around the world, I continue to be optimistic
about our future.
Thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,
Francis M. Scricco
Chairman, Board of Directors
