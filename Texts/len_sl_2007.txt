Letter to our Shareholders
Stuart A. Miller
President and Chief Executive Officer Lennar Corporation
 Dear Shareholders,
Market conditions in 2007 resulted in unprecedented challenges for the homebuilding industry. As the year unfolded, the market contracted at a pace that few could have anticipated. Our strategy throughout the year focused on our asset base as we strived to convert hard assets into cash. Consistent with our long-standing strategy, we made our balance sheet our top priority. That meant:
• Reducing the value of assets on our books to current market value where necessary
• Reassessing the value and risk of our joint venture partnerships
• Generating cash from home deliveries
• Negotiating innovative transactions such
as our sale of assets to a joint venture with Morgan Stanley
Our year-end results reflect the decisive actions taken by our Company to deal with the harsh realities of the homebuilding economy and to stay ahead of the curve knowing that market conditions could remain soft and perhaps continue to deteriorate in 2008. The results were as follows:
• Revenues of $10.2 billion – down 37%
• Loss per share of $12.31 – includes a
$12.62 per share charge related to
valuation adjustments and other write-offs
• Homebuilding operating loss of $2.9 billion
• Deliveries of 33,283 homes – down 33%
• Homebuilding debt to total capital
of 37.5% (net homebuilding debt to total capital of 30.2%) and cash
of $642.5 million at year-end
• Tax refund of $852 million received subsequent to year-end
While our year-end results are disappointing, we made meaningful progress preparing for 2008 and beyond. This challenging market
has given us cause to retrench, to reconsider and to reposition for another day. And that’s exactly what we’ve done. We have:
• Reviewed our assets and impaired them where necessary to reflect the full extent of the current market conditions
• Curtailed land purchases where possible, walked from option deposits on land contracts and wrote off pre-acquisitions costs
• Reconsidered and, where appropriate, restructured the composition and contribution of our joint ventures
Additionally, the Company has remained focused on keeping inventories low by using incentives and price reductions to sell homes and backfill cancellations, adjusting the rate of new home starts to the pace of sales and right- sizing our operating Divisions to meet reduced demand levels in the market.
We also generated cash by selling land assets that, because of reduced volume, would not be needed for many years. While most of these assets sold below their original book value due to the drop in market prices and the lack of demand for land assets, we believe that the cash value of these sales far outweighed the risk of holding the land assets on our books.
We generated cash by selling a portfolio of assets to a joint venture created by Morgan Stanley and our Company. While these assets sold at a price below their original book value and while we will be optioning some of the homesites back from this joint venture, we believe in this instance that the availability of cash generated from the deal is far more valuable than keeping the hard assets on our books.
Finally, and incidental to the execution of the sale of assets, we received substantial cash just after year-end by recovering taxes paid in prior years through realized losses incurred in 2007.

Our balance sheet remains strong, with our homebuilding debt to total capital ratio standing at 37.5%. And while we’ve recorded a net loss of $1.9 billion for the year, this loss is primarily the result of the reassessment of our land positions, joint ventures and deals under option or contract and our cash generation strategy designed to position us for the future.
As we look ahead to 2008, we recognize that market conditions remain difficult at best, and are likely to remain weak for the foreseeable future. We recognize that pricing and sales volume will be difficult to anticipate in this market environment. And we recognize that rebuilding margins and profitability will require a hands-on, bottom-up focus from each of our Divisions around the country.
Building homes is our core business, and we know well how to build homes profitably. In declining market conditions, profitability derives primarily from product adjustment and cost reduction. It requires the right price for the underlying land, the correct product on that land, the lowest construction costs possible and SG&A expenses properly sized for the operation. And it requires a focus on the processes that drive costs and assess product.
Throughout 2007, we have refined our business model in each of our markets and we have mapped out a strategy to rebuild margin in 2008. We have revamped product offerings in many of our markets. We’ve aggressively re- bid construction costs and we’ve lowered SG&A expenses by reducing our workforce by more than 50%. We’ve reviewed each Division’s business plan and have made meaningful progress in repositioning each individual Division to regain profitability as market conditions stabilize. Our strategy overall has been recalibrated to match existing conditions in each market.
As always, our focus on process continues. Each Lennar Division starts the day with a morning Plant Meeting where sales, starts, closings, inventory and asset base are carefully monitored. This review dovetails with regular
Executive Management meetings where the same elements are scrutinized on a Company- wide basis. Overall our management team is hands on and focused on our core operations on a daily basis.
From our quarterly Operations Reviews to our daily Plant Meetings in each Division, we are reviewing and re-reviewing the environment, adjusting our business and adapting our operations to changes in the market as they present themselves.
In conclusion, let me say to our Shareholders, our Customers, our Community and our Associates – we are thankful for your commitment and support in 2007. While one might become disheartened by the hard numbers on paper that define our results for 2007, we know there will be better times ahead. Market distress will ultimately give way to stabilization and recovery. Over-supply and credit market dysfunction will correct, and demand for new homes in America will rise to meet the needs of a growing population.
The Associates of Lennar will continue to work diligently to be properly positioned for that recovery. I am encouraged by the dedicated efforts put forth and the significant progress made by the many outstanding Associates of our Company. They have adopted a 24/7, “assess and adapt” approach to revitalizing our business in the most difficult of market conditions. Their tireless efforts, their conviction and their love for this Company will drive the future successes of Lennar as we build on the foundation of the progress that has been made in 2007.
Sincerely,
Stuart A. Miller
