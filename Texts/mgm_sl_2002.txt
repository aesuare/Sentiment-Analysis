POWERHOUSE
Looking back on the second anniversary of the merger, it’s clear the integration of these companies produced exactly the result we were aiming for: a streamlined powerhouse that, in good times and bad, will deliver on the promise of enhanced opportunities for employees and business partners as well as robust returns for shareholders.
Even though the year began in an environment of uncertainty, MGM MIRAGE had a vibrant 12 months, setting records in virtually every major financial and performance category. In 2002, we posted both record revenues and earnings, enabling us to improve our balance sheet through debt reduction, while still reinvesting substantially in our resorts and repurchasing our common stock.
2002 also ushered in an explosion in travel industry e-commerce, and
MGM MIRAGE was positioned to capitalize on this significant change in consumer behavior. Information technology may not be the most glamorous segment of our business, but done well, it can have a profound impact on finan- cial results. Year-over-year, MGM MIRAGE properties posted, collectively, a 38 percent gain in Internet bookings.
Another important component of our strategy is to stay a few steps ahead of consumer demand, and to that end, MGM MIRAGE marked more “firsts” for the industry. By this summer, all
major company properties will have converted to Ticket-In Ticket-Out gaming technology that our customers have strongly indicated they prefer over handling cash. This dovetails well with our new Players Club which has the competitive advantage of allowing our customers to “trade-up”, if you will, to redeem points at any of our resorts.
MGM MIRAGE also embarked upon an ambitious new development strategy. The multi-faceted approach includes construction of a new spa tower at Bellagio as well as the creation of two new production shows and buzz-generating new restaurants and nightclubs at several of our properties. The company is also aggressively

           pursuing new jurisdiction opportuni- ties as they develop in the northeastern United States and abroad.
This all occurred in a year that began with tremendous uncer- tainty, as the effects of the September 11 attacks still hung over the travel industry. We are most pleased to report that our business levels returned to almost normal during 2002, though we continue to work hard to enhance revenues in all areas and at all of our resorts. These improved business levels also allowed us to strengthen our most important asset-our people-as we re-hired a substantial number of employees previously affected by our response to the September 11 attacks.
POWER SHARING
One of the hallmarks of any successful organization is its ability to empower others. Working closely with our financial and
creative partners, we built or made plans to develop several important assets to provide a path for future earnings growth.
With our colleagues at Boyd Gaming, work progressed nicely on Borgata, the first resort hotel to open in Atlantic City in more than 13 years. We fully expect the $1 billion Borgata will up the ante in Atlantic City when it opens this summer.
MGM MIRAGE has also bene- fited from numerous relationships withentertainmentsuperstarswho provide definition and personality to our resorts. The formula for successful entertainment is impos- sible to duplicate.
MGM MIRAGE has the great fortune of long-lasting partner- ships with superstars such as Siegfried and Roy who in 2002 celebrated their 12th anniversary of unsurpassed supremacy on the Las Vegas Strip.

OUR COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY
WHEN MGM MIRAGE LAUNCHED THE GAMING INDUSTRY’S FIRST VOLUNTARY DIVERSITY INITIATIVE IN 2000, WE COMMITTED TO GREATER EFFORTS TO PURSUE DIVERSITY AS A MORAL AND BUSINESS IMPERATIVE IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR COMPANY’S OPERATIONS. WE ALSO PLEDGED WE
 WOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE AND VP, National Diversity Relations REPORT ON OUR PROGRESS.
WE ARE PROUD TO REPORT DEMONSTRABLE ADVANCEMENTS IN THE STRATEGIC AREAS OF EMPLOYMENT, PROCUREMENT, CONSTRUCTION, PHILANTHROPY, MARKETING AND SALES, ADVERTISING AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS. WE COMMEND OUR EMPLOYEES FOR THESE LAUDABLE GAINS. AS A DECLARATION OF ITS COMMITMENT TO DIVERSITY, IN 2002 THE MGM MIRAGE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CREATED A DIVERSITY COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE’S PURPOSE IS TO ASSIST THE BOARD IN GUIDING THE DIVERSITY INITIATIVE AS A STRATEGIC BUSINESS IMPERATIVE, ENGAGING ALL ASPECTS OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS.
MGM MIRAGE’S COMMITMENT TO EXPANDING THE DIVERSITY INITIATIVE IS FOCUSED ON CREATING A CULTURE THAT REFLECTS DIVERSITY AS A CORE VALUE: DIVERSITY IS WHO WE ARE, NOT JUST WHAT WE DO. WE BELIEVE THAT BY FOSTERING DIVERSITY IN OUR EMPLOYEES AND MANAGEMENT, WE WILL ACHIEVE THE GREATEST TANGIBLE BUSINESS RESULTS.
AS OF YEAR-END 2002, AN IMPRESSIVE 51.7% OF OUR WORKFORCE OF OVER 43,000 WERE MINORITIES, UP FROM 50.5% THE YEAR PRIOR. BY THE END OF 2001, 26.3% OF MANAGERS, DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVES WITHIN OUR COMPANY WERE MINORITIES. IN 2002, MINORITY REPRESENTATION IN OUR MANAGEMENT RANKS HAD GROWN TO 28%. OVERALL, WHILE THIS IS REFLECTIVE OF THE AMERICA IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, MGM MIRAGE STRIVES FOR
IMPROVEMENT. THE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATE PROGRAM,
SUPERVISORY PREPARATION TRAINING, LEADERSHIP

OF APPROACHES DESIGNED TO HELP EMPLOYEES GROW

 productions created with the signa- ture Cirque genius, marking the third and fourth collaborations between our organizations.
Restaurants, which have become marketing tools unto themselves, also saw powerful new names entering the Las Vegas marketplace because of your company’s initia- tive. In 2002, Tom Colicchio, one of the most respected and recog- nized names in the New York dining scene, brought to the MGM Grand his celebrated Craftsteak.
EMPOWERMENT
Our company’s power to be a leader in the hospitality industry is derived, in no small measure, from an awareness of our respon- sibilities to all our stakeholders and the communities in which we do business.
2002 was a year in which the company continued its historic record of employing a richly
diverse workforce and made signif- icant progress in reaching out to assist minority contractors and vendors looking to do business with MGM MIRAGE.
Our industry-leading efforts are practiced throughout the ranks. Last year the MGM MIRAGE Board of Directors demonstrated leadership at the highest levels of our company by creating a Diversity Committee chaired by Alexis Herman, former U.S. Secretary of Labor.
This is a critical element of our Diversity Initiative for several reasons. First, it elevates diversity as a priority to the Board level; second, the expertise on the committee is invaluable; and third, the committee will assist the Board in guiding the diversity initiative as a strategic business imperative.
     Our diversity initiative
                                                                                                
 is a strategic business imperative.

Another major initiative in 2002 was the launch of our MGM MIRAGE Voice Foundation. The Voice Foundation is a non-profit entity that disburses employee donations to charitable organizations in Nevada, Michigan and Mississippi. In 2002, employees contributed nearly $2,300,000 to worthy causes and organizations throughout the com- munities in which we do business.
POWER ON
While the current economic and global environment may be uncer- tain, we move ahead with clear purpose and focus: we will grow your company and continue
to generate returns that outstrip industry norms.
I am more excited today about the opportunities that lie ahead than at any time in my 26 years in this business. It is an honor to lead this company of 43,000 men and women who have created a powerhouse that will set the tempo in casino entertain- ment for generations to come.
