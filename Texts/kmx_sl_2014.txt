Letter to Shareholders
During fiscal 2014, we celebrated our 20th anniversary. CarMax was created in 1993 to address a strong consumer need for a better way to buy used cars. Since opening our first store in Richmond, Virginia, we’ve sold more than 5 million retail vehicles and expanded to 133 stores nationwide. We opened 13 stores in fiscal 2014 – our most in any one year. We anticipate a similar schedule of store openings for the next two years as we continue to fill in our national footprint. We were pleased this year to report double-digit growth in our estimated market share. Our data indicates that we grew share by 16% in the age 0 -10 used vehicle market.
During fiscal 2014, total revenues increased 15% to $12.6 billion. We sold more than 877,000 vehicles, including nearly 535,000 retail vehicles and more than 342,000 wholesale vehicles at our auctions. Our comparable store used unit sales growth of 12% was our strongest since fiscal 2002. CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) income increased by 12% to approximately $336 million and our loan portfolio grew to more than
$7 billion by year end. Net earnings rose 13% to $492.6 million or $2.16 per diluted share.
Superior Customer Experience
As we accelerated our store openings this year, we continued our focus on enhancing the customer experience – both online and in our stores. Our carmax.com website and mobile apps are essential tools used to drive customer traffic, and we continue to enrich their functionality to meet customer needs. This year we added more personalized elements, improved the search capabilities, redesigned the vehicle listings to be more impactful and scannable, added larger high definition photos with zoom capabilities, and enabled shoppers to make online appointments and hold cars for up to seven days.
Our web visits are measures of consumer interest in CarMax, and we believe increasing numbers of our customers are starting with us online. For the full year, our website visits grew to an average of approximately 12 million per month, increasing more than 32% from the previous year. By the end of fiscal 2014, visits to our mobile site represented 30% of total visits, while visits utilizing our mobile apps more than doubled compared with a year earlier - to more than 12% of our online traffic. In fact, by the end of fiscal 2014, 57% of our online traffic came from devices other than desktops or laptops.
While many customers start their search for the perfect vehicle online, our stores remain critical to the sales process. Many elements of the car-buying process, including test drives, financing and the completion of final paperwork, are still best handled at a store, with the assistance of well-trained associates. We continue to refine our recent store redesign, which includes greater utilization of technology and touch screen search capabilities, as well as other processes that elevate the customer experience, such as having all cars on the display lot unlocked and available for browsing and giving customers the option of test driving vehicles on their own.
During fiscal 2014, we also added 3 new wholesale auction sites, which are now conducted at 60 of our used car superstores. Since our inception, we’ve sold nearly 3 million wholesale vehicles at our auctions. Each year we continue to add more functionality to carmaxauctions.com, which allows dealers to manage their own accounts and provides them with a sneak-preview of our nationwide wholesale inventory, including photographs and vehicle history reports. Wholesale customers also can receive email alerts when specific vehicles become available at an upcoming auction.

Smart Growth and Associate Engagement
As we continue to grow, we know it’s essential to be smart about how we grow. We remain committed to the CarMax culture of continuous improvement. During fiscal 2014, we began testing a small format store, designed to allow us to economically enter smaller markets. The small format store also represents an ideal environment in which to test and develop more efficient ways of buying and selling vehicles. We opened our first two small format stores in Harrisonburg, Virginia and Jackson, Tennessee. In these stores, our focus on teamwork is particularly important, as associates handle multiple aspects of a customer’s transaction. In the small format environment and elsewhere throughout the company, we continue to search for scalable solutions.
We are delighted to have been named by Fortune magazine as one of its “100 Best Companies to Work For” for the tenth consecutive year. This honor is a testament to our continuous focus on a culture of integrity, diversity and respect, where associates have the opportunity to build fulfilling careers. Comprehensive and relevant training – online and in a classroom setting – are key to CarMax’s success. For the seventh consecutive year, CarMax was named to Training magazine’s Top 125, which recognizes organizations that provide extraordinary employer-sponsored workforce training and development programs. We are very proud of programs like the recently introduced Summit, which immerse entry-level managers into leadership development by having them work closely with other experienced managers. Not only does the program teach managers specific skills, it also incorporates nonprofit community service into the workshop.
CarMax Cares
Giving back to the communities in which we live and work is an integral part of the CarMax culture, and in fiscal 2014, The CarMax Foundation celebrated 10 years of making a positive impact in our communities. Established in 2003, the Foundation has evolved and expanded, and it had another record year in fiscal 2014. Annual grants totaled $4.7 million, and the Foundation surpassed $19 million in total giving since its formation. In addition, 100% of our locations organized at least one volunteer team builder and we held a record 729 total volunteer events during fiscal 2014.
As we grow and enter new markets, it’s important to demonstrate that CarMax will be an active and giving member of our new communities. The Foundation partners with the leadership teams in new stores to help them organize community volunteer projects before the store even opens. In fiscal 2014, more than 165 associates in newly opened stores participated in volunteer events prior to the grand opening of their location.
Recently, CarMax associates identified Children’s Healthy Living as the Foundation’s national focus. This year we committed to a three-year, $4.1 million partnership with the nationally recognized non-profit KaBOOM!. This organization targets communities in need of safe, accessible places for children to play, with the goal of ensuring that all children get the balance of active play they need to become healthy and successful adults. KaBOOM! doesn’t just build playgrounds, it empowers, connects and strengthens communities. CarMax is proud that our partnership to fund and build 30 playgrounds (7 of which were completed in fiscal 2014) will impact more than 100,000 children.
Thank you
CarMax has a tremendous opportunity for growth in the years to come. We’re currently in markets that comprise less than 60% of the U.S. population, and in many of those markets we’re not yet fully stored. Evolution and innovation are critical to our long-term competitive position, so we’re continuously refining our business model and continuously getting better. But it is the engagement and skill of our associates that will ultimately drive our success. Once again this year, let me take this opportunity to thank each and every one of our more than 20,000 associates for everything they do every day to support and drive our future. And, we also thank all our customers, communities and shareholders for their support and confidence in CarMax.
