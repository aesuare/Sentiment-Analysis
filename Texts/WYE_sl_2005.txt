against the backdrop of the last quarter of 2004-05 being adversely impacted by the introduction of Value Added Tax (VAT), in most States from 1st April, 2005. Systemic Anti-infectives, Alimentary tract and Metabolism products continue to constitute a major portion (45.42%) of the total market. However, other segments like Central Nervous System and Cardiovascular System are growing at a faster rate. Drug Pricing is an issue of importance to the Pharmaceutical Industry. The Government has announced Part A of the Draft National Pharmaceuticals Policy 2006, which deals with issues other than statutory price control. Part B of this document relating to pricing is awaited. Increase in span of price control by the Government from the current level will adversely impact the industry. The proposal by some States to introduce VAT from 1st April, 2006, resulted in sluggish sales growth during the last quarter of the year ended 31st March, 2006. FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The sales for the year ended 31st March, 2006 were Rs. 287.29 crores (previous year Rs. 255.50 crores), which represents an overall growth of 12.4%. The growth in pharmaceutical products sales was 12.1% and growth in OTC products was 14.9%. Pharmaceutical sales during the year were impacted by price reduction in Wysolone, without which the growth of sales for the Company would have been 17.4%. The Company continued to perform well in its core segments such as Oral Contraceptives and Anti-Infectives. The Company maintains its leadership position in Oral Contraceptives, Hormone Therapy, Folic Acid and Depilatory Cream Segments. During the year under review, the Company's manufacturing facility at Valsad, Gujarat, was closed. The land, which was taken on lease, was surrendered to Atul Limited as the manufacturing activity had stopped. A compensation of Rs. 10,00,00,000/- (Rupees ten crores only) was paid to Atul Limited for accepting surrender of the land on an as is where is basis, fifty-four years prior to the expiry of the lease terms in their ordinary course and to release and discharge the Company from all its obligations as lessee under the lease deeds including any and all environmental claims or liabilities, if any, relating to the surrendered leased lands. The Auditors comment in Clause 5(b) of their Report under the Companies (Auditors' Report) Order, 2003, on this transaction is clarified above. Excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses viz. Voluntary Retirement Scheme payments, impairment of fixed assets and compensation for surrender of leased land, profit for the year is Rs. 102.2 crores as compared to Rs. 53.6 crores in the previous year, which is a growth of 90.6%. The strong growth in profits is mainly due to good growth in sales, improved efficiencies and control on operating expenses. The Forhans trade marks were assigned to John Oak Remedies Pvt. Ltd., and the know-how for manufacture of toothpaste, toothpowder and toothbrushes was licensed to them on a non-exclusive basis during the current year. The Company received a consideration of Rs. 2.25 crores on the transaction in April 2006. OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS, RISKS AND CONCERNS The effective implementation of Product Patent Laws is very critical in ensuring that the intellectual property in new products is protected. This will encourage the launching of newer molecules as well as Research and Development in the country. The Consumer Health Care division of the Company is evaluating the OTC Indian market for launch of new products. The claims under the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account and the comments of the Auditors regarding the amount payable into the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account and claims by the Government regarding non-compliance with
