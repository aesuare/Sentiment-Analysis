DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
We achieved solid financial performance in fiscal 2015, in light of macroeconomic and PC-industry headwinds that resulted in softer demand during much of the year. We also continued to advance our strategy to be an innovative leader in the storage industry and, in doing so, create long-term value for our employees and shareholders.
In fiscal 2015, we achieved revenue of $14.6 billion, gross margin of 29.0%, net income of $1.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $6.18. We shipped 249 exabytes of storage, up 16% from fiscal 2014. Nearly 60% of our revenue was generated from non-PC markets, versus 53% a year ago.
In addition, our participation in growing, more profitable and largely cloud-related storage markets continued to expand. Reflecting this trend, our average terabytes per drive shipped grew 26% from the prior year to 1.1 terabytes.
We generated $2.2 billion in cash from operations during the 2015 fiscal year and we utilized $1.4 billion for dividends and share repurchases. We believe our capital allocation plan over the last several years is an appropriate and balanced approach that allows for both near-term and long-term value creation.
We are focused on managing the decline in our PC-related business and accelerating the growth of our cloud-related businesses as we enter fiscal 2016. Our strategic investments and execution over the last several years have resulted in a strong product and technology positioning for us as
we navigate this transition.

All data presented is on an annualized basis.

We achieved significant progress in advancing our growth initiatives in fiscal 2015:
• Our enterprise solid state drive revenue grew 60% year-over-year to $811 million, demonstrating the continued success and broadening customer acceptance of our leading SAS SSD products.
• We expanded our footprint in the enterprise SSD space with our new Ultrastar PCIe NVMe offering. We expect SAS and PCIe-based SSDs will be the main interfaces in the fast-growing enterprise SSD market over the next several years.
• We continued to see strong demand for our high-capacity helium hard drives, which provides compelling value for hyperscale datacenter customers and for next-generation active archive applications. We have delivered three helium-based HDD capacity points in the last two years.
• Revenue from our video surveillance hard drives continued its rapid growth in fiscal 2015, as we expanded our lineup of these purpose-built solutions for the global security industry.
• We saw positive market reaction to the value proposition of our new Active Archive system. Our acquisition of Amplidata, a leader in object storage software, provides a key building block for these systems that address a greenfield opportunity in enterprise storage.
Our view of persistent data growth remains intact, driven by mobility and the cloud. The outlook for our overall storage business remains healthy, and we believe we are well positioned to address this evolving space.
In closing, I want to thank our Chairman of the Board, Tom Pardun, for his 22 years of service on the Western Digital board of directors. Tom will be retiring at our annual shareholders’ meeting and will be succeeded as chairman by former chairman, president and CEO, Matt Massengill.
I also thank our employees for their dedication, and our shareholders, customers and partners for their support, and I look forward to reporting to you on our progress in the years ahead.
