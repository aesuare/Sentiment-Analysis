To Our Stockholders
We continued to make solid progress in 1997. During the year we improved our operating results, accelerated our store building and remodeling program, and com- pleted a major acquisition.
Strong Operating Results
Income in 1997 was $621.5 million ($1.25 per share) before extraordinary loss compared to net income of $460.6 million ($0.97 per share) the year before. During 1997 we incurred an extraordinary loss of $64.1 million ($0.13 per share) for the early retirement of debt, which reduced net income to $557.4 ($1.12 per share). Per-share amounts reflect a two-for-one stock split on February 25, 1998.
The company’s 1997 income statement includes Vons’ operating results since the beginning of the sec- ond quarter, while the income statements for 1996 and the first quarter of 1997 reflect Safeway’s 35% equity interest in Vons. Labor disputes reduced net income by an estimated $0.04 per share in 1997 and $0.07 per share in 1996.
Sales for the 53 weeks of 1997 were $22.5 billion compared to $17.3 billion for the 52 weeks of 1996. The increase was due primarily to the Vons merger and the additional week in 1997.
On a pro forma basis, gross profit rose to 28.63% of sales in 1997 from 28.20% in 1996, mainly because of improvements in buying practices and product mix. In addition, we recorded $6.1 million of LIFO income in 1997, reflecting slight deflation for the year. On a pro forma basis, operating and administrative expense

as a percentage of sales declined to 22.95% in 1997 from 23.30% in 1996. Pro forma information is based on the combined historical financial statements of Safeway and Vons as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of 1996.
Maintaining Financial Strength
Interest expense rose to $241.2 million in 1997 from $178.5 million the prior year. The increase resulted from the debt incurred to repurchase stock in conjunc- tion with the Vons merger and from the additional week in 1997. Despite the large increase in interest expense,

 our coverage ratio – operating cash flow divided by interest expense – improved to 7.18 times in 1997 from 6.94 times the year before.
During 1997 we reduced the average interest rate on debt by refinancing a significant portion of higher- cost debt, entering the commercial paper market and negotiating a new bank credit agreement.
Modernizing Stores and Support Facilities
In 1997 Safeway and Vons together invested $829 million in capital expenditures. We opened 37 new stores, completed 181 remodels and began construct- ing a new distribution center in Maryland. During 1998 we expect to spend approximately $950 million and plan to open 40 to 45 new stores, remodel more than 200 existing stores and finish construction of the Maryland distribution center.
The central focus of our capital spending program continues to be to improve our store system within existing markets. Replacement stores and remodels account for the majority of our capital investments. For further growth, we will consider other acquisitions outside our operating areas.
Vons Consolidation Ahead of Schedule
Largely as a result of the “can do” attitude of transition team members from both companies, we are well ahead of schedule in integrating the Vons operation into Safeway. We have already realized substantial synergistic benefits from the merger and anticipate more going forward.
Review and Outlook
It has now been five years since the current manage- ment team began working to turn around a company that was struggling with high costs, sluggish sales and inadequate returns on invested capital. In 1992 Safeway was an industry laggard, trailing its peers in almost every key measure of operating and financial performance. Today it ranks among the best.
During the last five years, the price of a share of Safeway stock has grown at an average annual rate of 58%. As shown on the chart on page 2, $1,000 invested in Safeway stock at the beginning of 1993 had increased in value to more than $9,730 by the end of 1997. We believe our efforts to execute the growth strategy outlined on the following pages are paying off. With the ongoing support of 147,000 Safeway employees, who have helped create our past success, we hope to continue to add value to your investment in 1998 and beyond.
We are committed to growing our business for our customers, our employees and our stockholders.
