 HOLLY CORPORATION
DEAR FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS
The year 2009 was a difficult period for the refining industry, and although Holly was not immune to the indus- try wide pressure on margins, we maintained profitability and continued to execute our strategic plan to create further value for shareholders.
Holly’s net income attributable to stockholders for 2009 was $19.5 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to $120.6 million, or $2.38 per diluted share, in 2008. We are not satisfied with our 2009
financial results, which reflect
the much more challenging
operating environment in 2009,
as compared to 2008.
Despite the challenges we faced in 2009, we successfully completed two important strategic acquisitions that we believe position Holly for renewed growth and enhanced profitability. We also continued to execute a number of important operational initiatives. In 2010, we will continue our ongoing efforts and we expect to realize additional benefits from our facility upgrades and recent acquisitions.
Some of Holly’s key accomplishments in 2009 and early 2010 include:
Acquisition of Two Refineries in Tulsa. In 2009 we acquired the Sunoco and Sinclair refineries, which are located less than two miles apart in Tulsa, Oklahoma. These acquisitions presented a unique opportunity to form the highest com- plexity factor refining facility in the Midcontinent and to
greatly increase Holly’s overall crude capacity. Thanks to the outstanding work of our new employees in Tulsa, we achieved a seamless transition of these refineries into our company. In addition, we announced the sale of certain logistics assets – both to Holly Energy Partners and a third party – that have allowed Holly to recoup a substantial portion of the purchase price of the Sunoco and Sinclair refining facilities.
Expansion and Upgrade of Exist- ing Facilities. Throughout the year, we continued our work to expand and upgrade our Navajo Refinery. Early in 2009 we completed the expansion of the Navajo Refinery from 85,000 to 100,000 barrels per day of crude capacity. We completed the phase

 two operational upgrades at the Navajo Refinery, which will permit us to run a wider range of lower priced crudes while increasing our flexibility in varying the mix of produced transportation fuels. In 2009, our Woods Cross Refinery in Utah saw the benefit of similar expansion and upgrade, which was completed in late 2008. Our Woods Cross mar- gins benefited significantly in 2009 from the ability to process lower cost crude feedstocks.
Significant Progress made on the UNEV Pipeline. Our project to build a pipeline from
Salt Lake City, Utah to
Las Vegas, Nevada, together with
terminal facilities in the Cedar City, Utah and North Las Vegas areas, is on track and we expect to complete this project in early 2011.
Record Results achieved at HEP.
During 2009, we benefited from the record performance of our affiliate Holly Energy Partners, L.P. (“HEP”). In 2009, HEP’s revenues increased to $146.6 million as compared to the previous year’s revenues of $108.8 million. The record earnings led to increased contributions to Holly, and we expect this strong performance to continue.
Our strategy this past year was characterized by prudent decision making and taking advantage of market and asset opportunities. These remain the cornerstone of our approach as we work to improve our financial performance and continue to grow as a leading independent refiner in 2010. Some of our plans for 2010 include:
Integrate the Operations of our Tulsa Refineries. Efforts to combine the two refineries through existing third party and new pipelines are currently underway. We believe that the
integrated facility will be a tier-one competitor in the Midcontinent markets it serves, like Holly’s refineries in the Southwest and Rocky Mountain markets. We expect the integra- tion to be substantially complete later this year.
Continue to Pursue Disciplined Growth. In 2009, we invested over $600 million in acquisi- tions and long-term growth projects. In 2010, our focus will be to optimize our assets as
well as continue to explore organic and external growth opportunities to further enhance shareholder value.
Maintain Solid Balance Sheet.
We intend to continue to main- tain our strong balance sheet,

 which will facilitate our strategy of capitalizing on strategic acquisitions and other value creating opportunities. Holly finished 2009 with $126 million in cash and marketable securities and a conservative capital structure.
Holly’s outstanding operational performance and track record of value creation are due in large part to the dedica- tion of the Company’s talented employees. Their ability to quickly and seamlessly integrate the Tulsa refineries and their efforts at the Woods Cross and Navajo facilities exemplify Holly’s commitment to operational excellence. I would like to extend my deepest appreciation and thanks to our employees for their service and continued hard work.
Looking forward, we expect that the refining industry will continue to face a challenging margin environment. At Holly, we remain committed to achieving superior financial performance and sustainable growth. In addition, our focus and commitment to safety remains unchanged. As always, we are dedicated to safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations and we will continue to work with the communities in which we operate to be a good corporate citizen.
