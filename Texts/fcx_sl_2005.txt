    Letter to Shareholders
To Our Shareholders:
We are pleased to report our 2005 performance, a record year for our company. The availability of high-grade ore from our Grasberg mine enabled us to achieve exceptional operating performance during a period of strong copper and gold prices. We generated over $1.5 billion in operating cash flows with only $143 million in capital expenditures, and reduced debt substantially, enabling us to return significant cash to shareholders.
Our mining team performed admirably during 2005, resulting
in 2005 sales for PT Freeport Indonesia, our Indonesian mining affiliate, of 1.46 billion pounds of copper and a record 2.8 million ounces of gold. Realized prices for our primary commodities were $1.85 per pound of copper, 35 percent higher than 2004, and $456.27 per ounce of gold, nearly 11 percent higher than 2004. Spot copper and gold prices on the London Metals Exchange (LME) were $2.08 per pound and $513 per ounce at the end of 2005 and have increased further in early 2006.
This strong performance enabled us to provide to the Republic of Indonesia $1.2 billion attributable to 2005 through taxes, royalties, dividends and fees. Since 1992, these direct benefits have totaled $3.9 billion, demonstrating that our partnership with the Government of Indonesia continues to be mutually beneficial.
Safety is our highest priority. We achieved continued progress
in safety performance at PT Freeport Indonesia, with no fatalities during 2005 and a lost time injury rate per 200,000 working hours of 0.13, a 28 percent improvement over 2004 and comparing favorably to the United States (U.S.) metals mining industry average of 1.9. The total reportable injury rate also improved to 0.38, a
17 percent improvement over the prior year. The U.S. metals mining industry average was 3.27.
These accomplishments provide the theme of this year’s Annual Report, “The Elements of Shareholder Value.”
Perhaps the most critical “Element of Shareholder Value” is having “The Right Asset.” The Grasberg minerals district is one of the
 The “6 South” section of the Grasberg open- pit mine provided important high-grade
ore that allowed us to achieve strong sales in 2005.

The Right Asset
“The Grasberg minerals district is one of the world’s greatest geological ‘treasures’ — the largest copper reserve and the largest gold reserve, both in the same mineralized material.”
world’s greatest geological “treasures” — the world’s largest proven and probable copper reserves and also the largest proven and probable gold reserves, both contained in the same mineralized material. The presence of significant quantities of both copper and gold in our ore is rare and is the key strength of our mining operations. Since we discovered the Grasberg in 1988, we have produced 17.6 billion pounds of copper and 26.1 million ounces of gold net to the interest of PT Freeport Indonesia. We continue to add to our reserves even with high levels of production in a mature operation. Since 1997, PT Freeport Indonesia has been able to replace almost 125 percent of its copper production and 60 percent of its gold production through continued exploration at the Grasberg complex as we further delineate known ore deposits and explore for new ore. PT Freeport Indonesia’s share of proven and probable recoverable reserves at the end of 2005 totaled more than 40 billion pounds of copper and approximately 44 million ounces of gold, establishing a long life for our operations. We anticipate adding to our reserves through ongoing exploration activities.
We are actively developing the Grasberg district to provide strong production decades into the future. Our Deep Ore Zone underground mine production averaged 42,000 metric tons of ore per day in 2005, well above the design capacity of 35,000 metric tons per day. The capacity of the underground mine is being expanded to a sustained rate of 50,000 metric tons per day with the installation of a second crusher and additional ventilation, expected to be completed in 2007. The Common Infrastructure Project to provide access to large undeveloped ore bodies through a tunnel system 400 meters below the existing tunnel system continued
in 2005 and is on schedule. The Common Infrastructure Project will enable us to explore at depths previously inaccessible. We are also developing Big Gossan, a high-grade deposit located near the existing milling complex.
Another essential “Element of Shareholder Value” is “The Right Time.” The markets for our primary commodities, copper and gold, are strong and the outlook for both commodities is positive. We have unhedged exposure to both metals and are well positioned with our long-lived reserve profile.
Copper prices rose to historical highs in 2005. Prices responded positively to low inventories, lower than expected copper production and increased investor interest in commodities. The LME spot copper price ranged from $1.39–$2.11 per pound and ended the

year at $2.08 per pound, a 46 percent increase from the price at
the beginning of the year. While prices are likely to be volatile, supply/demand fundamentals are positive and the global copper market remains tight. The market environment for gold improved throughout the year with growing investment demand, inflationary pressures, a weak U.S. dollar and ongoing geopolitical tensions. The London spot gold price ranged from $411–$538 per ounce during 2005 and the price was $513 per ounce at the end of the year, approximately 20 percent higher than at the start of the year.
“The Right Financial Strategy” reflects our objective to deliver value to shareholders. We have a long-established tradition of returning substantial cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases. We are executing a financial policy of maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, while providing significant cash returns to shareholders. During 2005, we completed financial transactions totaling $1.2 billion, including approximately $700 million in debt reduction and approximately $500 million
in common stock dividends and share purchases. Total debt at December 31, 2005, approximated $1.26 billion, $492 million net of $764 million of cash.
Our Board has established a policy of a regular dividend that could be maintained under a broad range of copper and gold
prices and providing additional cash returns through supplemental dividends and share purchases during periods of high prices. Holders of our common shares received dividends totaling $2.50 per share in 2005, including a regular dividend of $1.00 per share and three supplemental dividends totaling $1.50 per share. Our Board authorized an increase in the annual regular dividend to $1.25 per share starting in 2006 and authorized an additional $0.50 per share supplemental dividend payable March 31, 2006. We purchased 2.4 million shares of common stock for $80 million ($33.83 per share average) during 2005 and 14.2 million shares are available for purchase under our Board-authorized program.
During 2005, our Grasberg operations involved mining sections with extraordinary grades that were available to us following the successful remedial activities we completed during 2004. Our grade during 2006 will be strong, but lower than 2005 with sales estimated to approximate 1.3 billion pounds of copper and 1.7 million ounces of gold. Our cash flows will depend on future copper and gold prices. At the currently strong commodity prices, we would generate significant future cash flows. Our low level of capital expenditures

and debt servicing requirements provide opportunities for significant future returns to shareholders. We have reduced net debt more than 80 percent since 2000 and our near-term debt maturities are low. We have approximately $253 million in debt maturities during 2006 and $764 million of cash on hand at the end of 2005.
We appreciate the efforts of our employees whose hard work
and positive spirit over the last several years made it possible for
us to achieve record results in 2005. Throughout our history, we have successfully managed the challenge of operating the Grasberg minerals district in one of the most remote and physically complex terrains in the world. During 2005, our corporate headquarters team successfully managed our business affairs during the physical challenges resulting from Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which devastated our home city of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast Region. In the face of physical losses, our people persevered and we are grateful for their focus and efforts on behalf of our company.
We also want to offer our sincerest appreciation to our Board
of Directors, whose wisdom and counsel has shaped our past success and promising future for our shareholders. Our Board and employees constitute another key “Element of Shareholder Value,” which is “The Right Team.”
 Respectfully yours,
James R. Moffett
