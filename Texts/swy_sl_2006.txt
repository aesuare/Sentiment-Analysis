 To our stockholders
By any measure, 2006 was another outstanding year for Safeway. Building on the momentum of our dramatic improvement in 2005, we achieved robust earnings growth driven by strong sales gains and significant operating and administrative expense leverage. As we execute our strategy and satisfy our customers in 2007 and beyond, we are confident we can continue to build on our success.
Results from operations
Net income was $870.6 million ($1.94 per diluted share) in 2006 compared to $561.1 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2005. Various tax items increased earnings in 2006 by $0.22 per diluted share. Earnings in 2005 were reduced by a net $0.15 per diluted share for costs in- curred for store exit activities and employee buyouts, offset by the favorable resolution of various tax issues.
Sales
Total sales rose 4.6% to $40.2 billion in 2006 from $38.4 billion in 2005, primarily due to consistent execution of our strategy, ongoing success of our Lifestyle stores and
increased fuel sales. Comparable-store sales climbed 4.4%, while identical-store sales (which do not include replacement stores) were up 4.1%. Excluding fuel, comparable-store sales and identical-store sales increased 3.5% and 3.3%, respectively.
Lifestyle stores
With 751 Lifestyle stores in operation as of year-end 2006, they accounted for 43% of our total store base. These stores contributed significantly to sales growth throughout the year, and their aggregate return on capital continues to exceed our investment hurdle rate.
Gross profit
Gross profit in 2006 decreased by a net 11 basis points
to 28.82% of sales. Higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) reduced gross profit by 28 basis points. Excluding fuel, gross margin increased by 17 basis points primarily because of better shrink control, benefits from product-sourcing initiatives and improved product mix, partly offset by targeted price investments and increased advertising expense.

Operating and administrative expense
Operating and administrative expense in 2006 decreased 93 basis points to 24.84% of sales. Of this decline, 44 basis points were due to the store exit activities and employee buyouts in 2005, which did not recur in 2006. Higher fuel sales in 2006 reduced our O&A expense margin by another 13 basis points. The remaining decline last year is primarily the result of increased sales and reduced costs as a per- centage of sales for store labor, workers’ compensation and pension benefits.
Interest expense
Interest expense decreased $6.5 million to $396.1 million in 2006 despite higher average interest rates, primarily because average total debt declined.
Capital spending
Capital investments increased to $1.67 billion in 2006. During the year, we opened 17 new Lifestyle stores, completed 276 Lifestyle remodels and closed 31 stores. In 2007 we plan to invest approximately $1.7 billion
in capital expenditures and open approximately 25 new Lifestyle stores while completing some 275 Lifestyle remodels.
We also opened 27 fuel stations adjacent to our stores. As of year-end 2006, 340 of our stores sold gasoline, boosting sales at these locations while enhancing one- stop shopping convenience for our customers.
Cash flow
Net cash flow from operating activities increased to
$2.2 billion in 2006 from $1.9 billion in 2005, primarily because of higher net income. Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, increased $421 million to $1.7 billion in 2006. Net cash flow used by financing activities was $596 million in 2006, up from $467 million the prior year.
Returning cash to stockholders
We returned $414 million to stockholders in 2006,
$96 million in the form of dividends and $318 million in stock repurchases. The stock repurchases were largely funded by a substantial tax refund.

 Outlook
Safeway made solid progress in 2006. We continued
to gain market share in the supermarket channel and achieved strong operating and financial results. We believe this is further evidence that our growth strategy is working. To drive growth going forward, we will continue to innovate throughout our core business, keeping our offering fresh and relevant to our customers while providing them a unique, memorable shopping experience.
In addition, we will continue seeking innovative ways to drive future growth outside of our core business. We are gratified with the progress made by Blackhawk Network, a Safeway subsidiary that is the largest provider of third- party gift cards in North America. At year-end 2006,
the network comprised more than 60,000 storefronts
in the U.S. and Canada. As more cards are added to
the network and it expands in the United Kingdom and beyond, we believe there will be strong growth for years to come.
On the following pages, we touch on some of the ways we are bringing more to the table. These key elements of our strategy are designed to set us apart from the competition and generate profitable sales growth. Each element is focused on the consumer, because customer satisfaction is the driving force behind everything we do at Safeway.
In closing, I want to thank each of our 207,000 employees, all of whom have contributed to our success. A lot of hard work has gone into improving our business. With the continued support of the entire Safeway team, I’m confident your company has a promising outlook for 2007 and beyond.
