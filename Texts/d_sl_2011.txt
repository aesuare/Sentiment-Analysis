  A single electric service area seldom experiences an earthquake and a hurricane in the same
year. Yet in 2011, our electric utility, Dominion Virginia Power, experienced both in the same week—only a few days apart.
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
Building Dominion for the Future
 Dear Investors,
    / Dominion Resources / 2011 Summary Annual Report /

  We cannot find another instance in the past 100 years in which a particular area in the U.S. was hit by a significant earthquake and a major hurricane within a seven-day period.
The epicenter of the August 23 earthquake was just 11 miles from our nuclear-powered North Anna Power Station in Louisa County, Va. The quake, measuring a 5.8 magnitude on the Richter scale, triggered an automatic shutdown of both reactors, just as designed. For about three months, during which we replaced
North Anna’s electric output with our existing generation capacity and market purchases, company and Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) teams worked together to test structures, pipes, valves, pumps and safety equipment. In the end, the NRC concluded that North Anna was able to sustain the extreme force of this quake safely and without serious damage. This finding supports our consideration of a third nuclear reactor on the site. We are awaiting a combined construction and operating license (COL) from the NRC, which could issue the COL as early as late 2014. At that time, we will decide whether to proceed to the construction phase.
Then, just three days after the earthquake, Hurricane Irene hit, battering North Carolina and Virginia for nearly 30 hours and inflicting massive damage on Dominion’s electric transmission and distribution systems. About half of our electric utility customers — more than 1.2 million — lost electricity at some point during the storm. When it was over, thousands of line, patrol and support personnel, and crews from more than 20 different utilities and contract companies were deployed for nearly a week to restore essential services
to all customers. It was the second-largest restoration effort in our utility’s 102-year history.
A job safely and well done means reliable service
to our customers and better returns for our owners.
The thousands of employees who worked tirelessly throughout these back-to-back disasters embody the “One Dominion” philosophy. They put their personal lives on hold to answer the call of duty. That selfless commitment to their community and our company ensured the safety of our customers and our system.
Safety: Priority No. 1
At Dominion, safety is our paramount concern. We want all our employees each day to return home to their families safe and sound. We aim high—one injury or accident is one too many. Safety is embedded in our culture. Safety is also essential to the financial health of our company.
Why?
Because when our people look out for each other, everyone performs more efficiently and effectively, accidents are reduced, creative solutions are found to problems and morale improves. A job safely and well done means reliable service to our customers and better returns for our owners.
In 2011, employees delivered on important safety measures. I was proud when Dominion ended the year with all-time bests in the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) “recordable incident rate” and the “lost time/restricted duty incident rate.” The recordable incident rate — the number of reported workplace injuries per 100 employees—dropped to 0.92,
a 51 percent decline in the past five years. The lost time/restricted duty incident rate—the number of workplace injuries that resulted in lost workdays
or reassignment of duties per 100 employees—fell to 0.42, a five-year, 55 percent decline.
   / 2011 Summary Annual Report / Dominion Resources /

        In the wake of Hurricane Irene, thousands mobilized to restore power to 1.2 million customers.
During the late evening hours on Friday, August 26, Hurricane Irene made landfall in North Carolina and began winding its way through Dominion Virginia Power’s service area, bringing down trees and power lines in its path. Over the next 30 hours the storm would take to exit our region, more than 1.2 million customers would lose electricity. In Dominion Virginia Power’s 102-year history, only Hurricane Isabel in 2003 had a larger impact.
By mid-day Monday, Dominion had completed its damage assessment and had restored service to about
half of the affected customers. The next six days would require the more arduous undertaking of returning electric service to areas with the most damage. In the Richmond area, for instance, which had sustained winds of 40-plus miles per hour for 17 hours,
more than 75 percent of customers experienced power loss, as well as some of the most extreme damage.
Daniel K. Neighbors, Jr., a lineman based in East Richmond, answered the call of duty, putting in 14–16-hour days to ensure that all Dominion customers had their lights back on. “The biggest thing is helping someone,” he said. “Giving back is what it’s all about.”
Neighbors was one of 7,000 line, patrol and support personnel, including 3,100 mutual aid and tree crews from more than 20 different utilities and contract companies, who joined the restoration effort. Overall, they repaired damage at 35,000 work locations and restored service to all customers in about a week.
“The biggest thing is helping someone. Giving back
is what it’s
all about.”

    / Dominion Resources / 2011 Summary Annual Report /

Imagine the effort of our electric transmission employees, who—even with the huge power restoration effort from Hurricane Irene—went 164 straight days without a recordable incident in 2011. That safety performance sets the bar high. Employees at Sweeney Station in West Virginia, a part of our gas transmission business, were up to the task. They have completed more than five decades without a lost time incident.
Financial Year in Review
While Mother Nature wreaked havoc in Virginia this past year, the global financial system was rocked by problems in Europe. The precarious financial conditions of some European Common Market countries resulted in unprecedented market volatility. Low consumer confidence scores for most of the year reflected slow economic recovery in the U.S.
Our owners, however, continue to benefit from the fact that Virginia is the home base of our electric utility, which represents about half of our earnings. In 2011, Virginia’s economy remained largely recession-resistant principally because
of the presence of the U.S. military, the federal government, government contractors and several energy-intensive data centers.
Last year I wrote you that Dominion might experience its first year-over-year operating earnings per share decline since 2005. We anticipated this possibility because of (1) several major merchant power stations being taken offline for maintenance, refueling and environmental equipment tie-ins and (2) historically low commodity prices. Indeed, this is what happened. What we did not expect were the revenue losses from
Be Safe Today
In late 2010 and early 2011, the Services company, which includes more than 2,500 employees, initiated the “Be Safe Today” campaign.
Services company executives sent a campaign kickoff letter to their employees reminding them to take safety personally and act to eliminate potential hazards. Monthly safety messages were emailed. And the employee intranet site was redesigned to feature the “Be Safe Today” campaign.
In 2011, Dominion Resources Services had just one OSHA recordable incident. In 2012, as always, we will strive for zero.
natural disasters and relatively mild weather that caused customers to use less air conditioning in the summer and heat in the winter.
In 2011, Dominion earned $3.05 per share in operating earnings, down from $3.34 per share in 2010, meeting the guidance range we anticipated in January 2011 of $3.00 per share to $3.30
per share.* Earnings under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in 2011 were $2.45 per share, down from $4.76 per share in 2010.**
Higher Shareholder Return
Despite this drop in operating earnings per share, Dominion’s total shareholder return — the combination of a share of common stock’s price appreciation or depreciation over a year and its dividend payout—ended 2011 at 29.4 percent. This bested the returns of the major indices—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, at 8.3 percent, and the S&P 500, at 2.1 percent. In addition,
we exceeded the returns of our peers in the Dow Jones Utility Average, the S&P 500 Utilities and the Philadelphia Utility Sector Index, which yielded 19.6 percent, 19.9 percent
and 19.2 percent, respectively.
Last year, Dominion returned $1.97 per share in dividends to shareholders, a 7.7 percent increase from 2010. We paid out 64.6 percent of operating earnings per share, within the 60–65 percent payout target range set by the board
in 2010.*** In addition, we repurchased about
13 million shares on the open market for approximately $600 million to offset the expected earnings per share impact from economic recovery tax provisions relating to accelerated asset depreciation.

Outlook for 2012
Our guidance for 2012 anticipates operating earnings in the range of $3.10 per share to $3.35 per share.* With rising energy demand, lower interest expense, construction and operation of new infrastructure in our regulated businesses and continued control over operating expenses, we expect 5   6 percent earnings per share growth in 2012. That growth should continue
for the foreseeable future.
We expect that the dividend payout ratio will again be near the top end of our target range
in 2012. In January 2012, the board increased the annual dividend rate by 14 cents per share, or 7.1 percent—to $2.11 per share, subject to quarterly declaration. We expect our directors to continue aligning dividend increases with our expected earnings per share growth of
5–6 percent.**
Strong Foundation Fuels Growth Plans
Over the past five years, your company sold commodity-based businesses to reduce earnings volatility and strengthen our balance sheet.
Since then, we have targeted billions of dollars
in investment in federally and state-regulated projects to meet the growing demand of our customers and maintain system reliability.
Investor confidence in our performance and earnings outlook is based on the fundamentals of our business model: investing in and maintaining energy infrastructure designed to last for generations. Our growth comes from
a strong foundation of concrete and steel, reinforced by the values in our culture: working safely and responsibly, and respectfully looking out for one another.
The strength of this foundation was affirmed when our employees rallied to respond to two natural disasters in August. It was also affirmed when Dominion Resources took advantage of its strong credit metrics and balance sheet to raise
* See page 22 for GAAP Reconciliation of 2012 Operating Earnings Guidance.
** All dividend declarations are subject to Board of Directors approval.
Since 2007, we have added more than 1,500 megawatts of generating capacity
and about 300 miles of transmission lines.
$850 million in two separate debt issuances with terms of three and five years—selling at interest rates below 2 percent, among the lowest ever recorded for U.S. holding companies. These offerings were part of nearly $2 billion in senior notes that Dominion issued in 2011.
Dominion did not issue any net common stock in 2011. And, with the exception of issuing approximately $320 million in equity through our employee savings plans, direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan, and other employee and director benefit plans, we do not anticipate issuing common stock in 2012.
Building for Virginia
In 2011, we completed three major projects
for our utility customers in Virginia and North Carolina on time and on budget. These included the $619 million, 590-megawatt gas-fired
Bear Garden Power Station in Central Virginia, and two 500-kilovolt transmission lines in Northern Virginia and Southeastern Virginia, which cost $479 million combined. Bear
Garden is now online and generating electricity. And the Meadow Brook-to-Loudoun and Carson-to-Suffolk transmission lines are transporting power that flows to consumers.
Since our utility growth program began in 2007, Dominion has added more than 1,500 megawatts of generating capacity and about 300 miles of transmission lines to serve Virginia and North Carolina customers.
Despite sluggish growth in the overall economy, weather-adjusted power usage at Dominion Virginia Power rose 1.6 percent in 2011. The utility set a new peak demand record of 20,061 megawatts on July 22, 2011, surpassing the previous record of 19,688 megawatts, set in August 2007. Load from data centers, each of which consumes as much electricity as 9,000 typical homes, is expected to nearly double over the next two years. To keep the Internet up and running 24/7, we must provide reliable electric service to data centers 24/7.
    / 2011 Summary Annual Report / Dominion Resources /

As a result of continued demand growth, we expect to invest about $8 billion from 2012 through 2016—to serve our customers. Here are some of the near-term projects:
• The $1.8 billion coal- and biomass-fired Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center in Southwest Virginia is expected to come online in summer 2012. The 585-megawatt facility is on budget and on time.
• A $1.1 billion, 1,300-megawatt gas-fired power station in Warren County, Va., is expected
to be operational in late 2014. It is one of three large gas-fired plants that the company plans to construct over the next decade. We have proposed building one of them in Brunswick County, Va., and are seeking a location for the third facility.
• Another 500-kilovolt transmission line,
the $350 million Mount Storm-to-Doubs modernization project that would increase line capacity by 67 percent, serving Northern Virginia, is planned for completion in 2015.
It is one of 40 electric transmission projects totaling nearly $3 billion aimed at ensuring reliability in the Dominion Virginia Power system over the next five years.
These projects help sustain the economic vitality of local communities. According to Chmura Economics & Analytics, our growth plan will support more than 14,200 construction jobs in Virginia through 2015 and produce annual economic benefits of more than $290 million. When completed by 2015, these projects should add more than 750 new full-time local jobs.
Recovering Investments, Earning Fair Returns
The success of these projects depends in part on earning a fair return on these investments.
At the end of 2011, the Virginia State Corporation Commission reviewed Dominion Virginia Power’s earnings from 2009–2010 and set an authorized return on equity of 10.9 percent on base rates going forward—which, under Virginia law,
According
to Chmura Economics & Analytics, our growth plan will support more than 14,200 construction jobs in Virginia through 2015.
allows the company to earn up to 11.4 percent before triggering any potential refunds or rate reductions. Equity for new nuclear or renewable generating stations would earn 12.4 percent; equity for new plants powered by coal or natural gas would earn 11.4 percent.
The state’s constructive regulatory environment is important in allowing our company to continue to access cost-effective capital for new and ongoing construction projects. We continue to work with our regulators to ensure that Dominion Virginia Power’s rates remain responsible, competitive and fair. As of January 2012, our residential rates were about 10 percent below
the national average and 19 percent below the East Coast average.
Renewed Focus on Natural Gas,
Natural Gas Markets
As I wrote you last year, we are benefiting from our past experience in E&P in the Appalachian Basin—not as producers, but as a developer of infrastructure, a business with which we have
had substantial success. To take advantage of significant natural gas finds and production in
the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations, we
are investing in new transmission pipelines, gathering, storage and processing facilities,
and are reconfiguring existing pipes. We are working with customers who need our pipelines to transport the natural gas they produce to diverse markets and with those who need our processing plants to prepare the gas for transport.
Overall, we are planning to spend $2.2 billion on natural gas transmission infrastructure over the next five years, with the potential for an additional $1 billion.
The Utica Shale and the western portions of the Marcellus Shale formations produce “wet” gas, meaning the natural gas contains heavy hydrocarbons or natural gas liquids that can be

    Our hallmark EnergyShare program is a success because of a shared responsibility to help those in need.
It began 30 years ago with a bright idea: that our electric utility ought to help the state’s most vulnerable citizens—the unemployed, the working poor and families facing a financial crisis with no other place to turn—meet their heating needs during the winter freeze.
That idea became our signature energy-assistance program, EnergyShare, which has distributed $52 million to aid 250,000 families — or more than a half-million people—so they may remain comfortable in their homes during the coldest and hottest times of the year.
We now partner with more than 110 agencies to administer the program in Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio. Dominion has directly supported the campaign with more than $20 million; our employees have kicked in an additional $1.4 million through payroll deductions.
To recognize EnergyShare’s 30th anniversary, we developed and unveiled a new TV and print advertising campaign. And we challenged employees in the three states to contribute in honor of the program’s anniversary.
2011 Highlights
Dominion contributed $4.5 million to EnergyShare, aiding more than 20,000 families.
Our customers contributed more than $1.1 million and employees donated $81,000 to the program.
The company partnered with more than 110 agencies in three states.
Virginia Gov. Robert F. McDonnell attended
a special ceremony commemorating the 30th anniversary of EnergyShare in the state and called this observance to the attention of all Virginia citizens.
The program received the 2011 National Fuel Funds Network Corporate Excellence Award, which recognizes outstanding achievement by a company on behalf of its low-income customers.
               / 2011 Summary Annual Report / Dominion Resources /

    Giving back to the communities where we live and work is essential to our success.
From planting tree seedlings and marsh grasses to filling and distributing care packages for U.S. troops overseas, Dominion and its 15,800 employees are committed to the communities they serve.
Through Dominion and The Dominion Foundation, the company’s philanthropic arm, we gave more
than $21.6 million in 2011 to meet essential human needs and support environmental stewardship, education and community vitality in the states where we do business. And our employee volunteers donated nearly 160,000 hours of their time mentoring children, clearing trails at parks, and
refurbishing shelters and the homes of elderly poor citizens, among other worthy causes.
This proven and shared belief in community investment was evident for the second straight year in 2011, when United Way Worldwide recognized your company with the Summit Award for Community Impact. Dominion was one of only four companies nationally to receive this prestigious honor.
In 2010, Dominion accepted a national Summit Award for Community Volunteerism.
Ours is a lasting commitment to serving our communities.
2011 Highlights
Our employees volunteered almost 160,000 hours.
We contributed more than $300,000 to organizations assisting tornado, earthquake and hurricane victims in four states.
The foundation gave more than $1.35 million in K-12 and higher education grants
to 34 colleges and community colleges and 70 schools and other educational institutions in 12 states.
We contributed $250,000 to 10 organizations in six states lending aid
to homeless veterans, wounded veterans and military families.
Dominion assisted food banks in 13 states and the District of Columbia with $435,000 in donations.

separated into propane, butane, iso-butane and natural gasoline. Before this gas is delivered
to market through pipelines, it must be sent to processing plants that separate the liquids from the gas stream, such as the $500 million Natrium natural gas processing plant we are building
in West Virginia. Strategically situated on the Ohio River to cost-effectively transport gas and liquid products to nearby markets, the plant is scheduled to begin operations at the end of 2012. It will process gas from both the Marcellus and Utica Shale regions. A proposed second phase at Natrium would be expected to nearly double gas and liquids processing capabilities, if completed.
In 2011, Dominion retrofitted a gas pipeline to deliver wet gas to processing facilities such as Natrium. This $23 million project was completed on budget and on time. We will continue to invest in other Marcellus and Utica Shale pipeline projects in 2012 and beyond.
Dominion is also planning almost $1 billion in investments in our conventional gas gathering, storage and transportation businesses. First,
our Gathering Enhancement project, being phased into service in 2011 and 2012, will increase efficiency in Dominion Transmission’s gathering system. Second, Appalachian Gateway is expected to add pipelines and compressor stations to deliver Appalachian gas production into Southwest Pennsylvania. We expect it to enter service in September 2012. Both projects are on budget and on time.
Longtime investors know that in 2002 we acquired Cove Point on the Chesapeake Bay to import liquefied natural gas (LNG). Today, with a supply-heavy natural gas market in the U.S., Appalachian gas producers are exploring the possibility of selling into higher-priced
gas markets in Europe and Asia. We are in discussions with producers and potential customers to evaluate the merits of liquefying
We are planning to spend more than $2 billion on natural gas transmission infrastructure over the next five years.
natural gas for export at Cove Point. Of course, any decision to move forward would require firm contracts from producers and end users and permission from the U.S. Department of Energy to export LNG to both free trade and non-free trade agreement countries. We will keep you posted on these developments.
Investing in the Environment,
Alternative Energy
Because of the sound decision to spend about $3 billion on environmental upgrades since 1998, Dominion is in relatively good position to comply with new, more stringent federal regulations of air pollutants.
To keep our environmental commitments and ensure compliance with new federal regulations, we made a series of decisions that we believe will minimize our impact on the environment by reducing mercury, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emissions.
In Virginia, our environmental compliance strategy is expected to require $1.8 billion in capital expenditures by 2016 to (a) retire coal units, as necessary, (b) convert some units to utilize an alternate fuel source, (c) retrofit others with environmental equipment and (d) build new generation and transmission capacity. We made these decisions based on the most reasonable cost options and our obligation to reliably
serve our customers, asking: Do the benefits of improving a power station outweigh the costs to the company and our customers and continue providing reliable service?
Using this analysis, beginning in 2014, we expect to close coal units at Chesapeake and Yorktown. And we plan to convert three coal-fired units to burn biomass and several other units from coal to natural gas. In all, we expect a net loss of more than 750 megawatts that would be replaced by new, cleaner generating capacity and new, high-voltage transmission lines.
   / 2011 Summary Annual Report / Dominion Resources /

Using a cost-benefit analysis in assessing our merchant power business—are the costs of adding environmental equipment justified
for our company and our shareholders? — we have announced plans to retire Salem Harbor in Massachusetts and State Line in Indiana, both coal-fired generating stations. The company began deactivating these units in 2011. We are also investing in added environmental controls at two other coal-fired plants—Brayton Point in Massachusetts and Kincaid in Illinois.
We are also doing our part to invest in alternative energy solutions and energy efficiency. Dominion’s Alternative Energy Solutions group is reviewing investments in such energy technologies as offshore wind, solar photovoltaic, distributed generation, fuel cells, battery storage and smart microgrids, among other things. A Dominion Virginia Power pilot program helps electric vehicle owners who utilize off-peak charging of their vehicles by providing favorable rate structures.
Thank You
Although, as expected, 2011 brought about the first year-over-year operating earnings decline since 2005, Dominion had a successful year.
Our employees did their jobs safely and
well, helping to set new companywide OSHA recordable incident records along the way.
The Fossil & Hydro and nuclear business units, Dominion East Ohio and Dominion Hope and our Services company all had best-on-record safety performance in 2011.
Our growth investment program moved full steam ahead, on budget and on time.
We continued to work constructively with our regulators.
Our total shareholder return outpaced that of the major market indices and of our peers.
In addition, our employees volunteered
almost 160,000 hours of community service. These efforts were recognized by United Way
Worldwide, which presented Dominion with one of four national Summit Awards, the only utility to receive such an honor.
The company and its philanthropic arm gave more than $21 million to support essential human needs, environmental stewardship, education and community vitality in 14 states.
What makes me especially proud is Dominion’s leadership in hiring military veterans. Coming from a military family, I am keenly aware of the challenges faced by combat veterans returning home. At Dominion, we recruit veterans for careers as line workers, nuclear security officers, power station operators and other vital jobs because they are disciplined, safety-conscious and civic-minded. We launched the Troops
to Energy Jobs program to fulfill this mission. In 2011, we hired about 100 veterans.
Economic conditions and the August “hurriquake” reminded us to expect the unexpected. The work of Dominion’s 15,800 employees in 2011—building on our foundation of safety, ethical behavior, excellence and teamwork—gives me confidence we can overcome just about any obstacle that Mother Nature and, yes, also human nature might throw in our way in 2012.
Thank you for investing your hard-earned money in Dominion and putting your trust in us to build necessary energy infrastructure for the future.
Sincerely,
Thomas F. Farrell II
Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer
