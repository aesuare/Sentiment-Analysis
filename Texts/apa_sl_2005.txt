The year 2005 was rewarding and challenging. Our people were more than up to the challenge. Driven by record-high commodity prices, Apache earned a record $2.6 billion or $7.84 per diluted share, up 56 percent from 2004. Cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities* totaled $4.7 billion, up 39 percent from 2004, also an all-time high. In the face of two of the worst hurricanes to strike the Gulf of Mexico in recorded history, the strength of our portfolio approach could not be more apparent. Despite the hurricanes, Apache still managed to increase production 1.4 percent, making 2005 the 26th out of the last 27 years we have grown production. Hurricane damage to Apache's production facilities as well as to pipelines and shore facilities owned by others reduced annual companywide production approximately 5 percent from what it otherwise would have been.But strong performance in our other regions, fueled by our active worldwide drilling program ­ 2,383 wells with a 91 percent success rate ­ enabled Apache not only to increase our production in 2005, but also to increase reserves by 9.3 percent to a record 2.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent, the 20th consecutive annual increase. We replaced 216 percent of production, 98 percent through the drill bit, adding 358 million barrels of oil equivalent. The 2005 additions alone equal Apache's size in 1994, two years after we moved to Houston. Over the last three years, Apache has replaced 271 percent of its reserves ­ two-thirds of which came through the drill bit, spread across our portfolio. During 2005, we invested $3.4 billion on exploration and production capital, excluding a $547 million non-cash accrual for future abandonment liability. Apache has long believed in the importance of building a diversified portfoTHREE-YEAR AVERAGE RESERVE REPLACEMENT

lio of assets from which to grow. Twenty years ago, the company was almost exclusively a western Oklahoma gas producer.While we've remained very active in Western Oklahoma, we also decided to build Apache into a company with a much broader scope. In seeking new areas, we pursue opportunities with the potential to build a business for the long term, rather than taking a one-block, one-well approach. We are attracted to areas with a business environment that is conducive to profitable growth through grassroots drilling and acquisition activities. In each core area, our goal is to build critical mass that can eventually support a sustainable program of lower-risk, repeatable drilling opportunities, balanced by higher-risk, higher-reward exploration. Over the last 20 years, as we have extended our reach, we have established six core areas. The four regions outside the United States represent 62 percent of our production and 58 percent of our reserves. We have good geographic diversity, with no single basin contributing more than 27 percent of reserves or production. In all of our core areas, we have large and visible producing assets and broad undeveloped acreage positions that provide running room for the future. We also have developed balance in our ratio of oil and gas production and reserves.Although there are times when one product is in greater demand than the other, over the years we have learned that attempting to focus exclusively on either oil or gas is short-term folly.We recognize that we are not clairvoyant and that a balanced product mix gives us upside market potential to both. We believe a company must have several core competencies in order to survive and grow over the long term. A company must be able to both explore and exploit its asset base and must be able to acquire properties and add value to them. ExxonMobil did not attain its size by simply drilling wells.You don't have to look past that company's name to recognize the importance of acquisitions in building size and scope. Over the years, Apache has become well known for acquiring and exploiting properties, and more recently we are beginning to be noticed for our exploration capabilities. The positions that we now enjoy in all of our core areas give us opportunity to sustain that effort. Because of our quest in the early 1990s to build critical mass through acquisitions, Apache is often viewed as a company that can grow only through such transactions. In reality, in 2005 we were among the top five operators in terms of drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico, Western Oklahoma, Western Australia, the United Kingdom North Sea and the Western Desert of Egypt. We were among the top 10 in drilling activity in Canada and West Texas. None of these areas are small by any standard. Over the past five years, we have invested

approximately $13.5 billion, with more than 65 percent of the total spent on exploration and development activities. During that five-year period, we have grown production by 75 percent and reserves by 95 percent. Each area in which we operate meshes well with at least one of our core competencies. It is important to recognize what each area provides to the overall portfolio and not try to make it deliver something it is not capable of providing. Take, for example, the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. Recently, some investors have suggested that we consider leaving the Shelf and redeploying that capital into other areas or into a share buyback program. From a strategic standpoint, the Shelf fits well in our portfolio and consistently delivers high returns on capital employed, as well as cash flow significantly in excess of our exploration and development spending in the region, year in and year out. The high cash flow helps fuel other core areas that have growth potential. We take advantage of what the Shelf gives us and do not push the envelope for the sake of growth. Apache's entry into the Gulf started in 1981 when we partnered with Shell Oil Company at a time when the U.S. government began encouraging independents to enter the Gulf. Until that era, it was almost exclusively the majors' playground. Through an innovative, tax-efficient investment structure, Apache partnered with one of the premier companies in the Gulf of Mexico in an initiative that fostered a very good working relationship with Shell that has lasted 25 years; we're still proud of this relationship today. It was the catalyst for our 1992 acquisition of properties from Shell, which added to our foothold in the Gulf. Then, in 1993, Apache acquired a financially troubled independent that was overextended in developing its Gulf discoveries.We paid $171 million for the Hall-Houston assets, which brought not only producing fields, but also significant development projects and a number of undeveloped blocks on which to explore. Our strategy early on was to exploit around our base of production while using our existing infrastructure to leverage the returns on what we found. We have stuck to that game plan, and it has been a very effective business model for adding properties and production. In 1999, we took a giant leap forward with the acquisition of a large portion of Shell's Shelf oil and gas properties. We acquired 125 MMcf per day of natural gas production and 25,000 barrels per day of oil production, but more important, we acquired 64 blocks on which we could drill wells and add value. The Shell acquisition enabled us to gain critical mass across the Gulf and enhance efficiencies of our operations.After the transaction,our span extended across both the Texas and

Louisiana Gulf of Mexico Shelf, with operated daily production of 270 MMcf of gas and 30,000 barrels of oil from 131 platforms. Since 1999, our pace of growth in the Gulf has accelerated significantly. In 2000, we acquired properties from Occidental Petroleum; in 2003, from both BP and Shell; and, in 2004, we added all of Anadarko Petroleum's Shelf assets in that company's strategic exit from the area. From 1999 through 2005, we invested $2.4 billion on Gulf acquisitions and spent an additional $1.8 billion on exploration and development activities on the properties we purchased over this period. The Gulf has been and remains an important part of our overall portfolio; one that, given the departure by other companies, represents a strong Apache niche. How do we respond to suggestions that Apache exit the Gulf? We believe the facts in the accompanying chart speak for themselves: Apache's acquisitions have returned 136 percent of our investment, and as a result of continued exploitation -- at year-end these properties still had proved reserves of 220 MMboe, 64 percent of the originally acquired total. In 2006, we plan to drill 72 wells on the Shelf -- all on properties acquired since the 1999 Shell transaction.

Photo Left The Central Region's broad acreage positions in the Permian Basin, western Oklahoma and East Texas provide consistent returns from low-risk drilling opportunities and operating efficiencies.

While our Gulf Coast region was battling the challenges presented by the hurricanes, the diversification we have developed over the years paid great dividends. Each of Apache's other core areas stepped forward to take up the slack. In the United States, our Central Region ­ which comprises 56 percent of Apache's U.S. reserves across large acreage positions in western Oklahoma, the Permian Basin
7

and East Texas ­ increased production by 17 percent and reserves by 11 percent in 2005. Production was fueled by the region's most active drilling program in history ­ 364 wells with a 97 percent success rate. Our early 2006 acquisition from Amerada Hess of eight producing fields in the Permian Basin along with another active drilling program sets the stage for double-digit growth in the region in the year ahead. If a "resource play"is defined as a large acreage position, low-risk drilling opportunities and reliable production, then Apache's Canadian operations represent a perfect fit. Fueled by our most active Canadian drilling program ever, the region's natural gas production increased 14 percent.Apache drilled 1,674 wells in Canada across our 7 million acres in 2005 (mainly at Nevis, Hatton and on acreage acquired in the ExxonMobil farm-in agreements of 2004 and 2005) adding proved reserves of 105 MMboe. With acquisition and land costs rising in Canada, the farm-ins provided a way for Apache to earn acreage through drilling on 1,815 sections in Alberta with no upfront costs. ExxonMobil retains a carried interest in the fields. We will be developing this acreage through drilling for years to come. Apache is the leading company employing coiled-tubing drilling in Canada. This lower-cost method enables Apache to undertake large-scale programs to drill shallow wells across our Canadian acreage. In 2005, Apache commenced production from the Midale carbon dioxide (CO2) enhanced oil recovery project, which is expected to extend the life of the field by 25 years and provide an important environmental benefit by sequestering CO2 transported from the Dakota Gasification Co. in Beulah, North Dakota. Internationally, Apache's Egyptian operations increased production by 10 percent in 2005, fueled by the start-up of our Qasr gas development and an active drilling program. Apache added 67 MMboe of proved reserves in 2005. The start-up of the Qasr gas development marks a milestone in Apache's history. Discovered by Apache in 2003, the Qasr gas/condensate field is the largest field ever found by Apache ­ more than 2 trillion cubic feet of gas and 50 million barrels of estimated recoverable reserves. Apache's 10.7 million acres across the vast Western Desert provides opportunity for growth over an extended period.At shallow depths, the Cretaceous Upper Bahariya formation represents a sizable resource play with more than 150 million barrels of undeveloped potential. Deeper intervals offer outstanding exploration potential in 30 to 40 conventional reservoirs from lower Cretaceous to Jurassic that are within established producing trends. By year-end 2006, Apache expects to have nearly 9,000 square miles of 3-D seismic across our extensive Western Desert acreage. This treasure trove of data in the hands of

· 3-D seismic coverage leads to exploration success ­ 16 of Egypt's 33 discoveries recorded in 2005 were drilled by Apache · Resource play with large acreage position, extensive exploitation and exploration potential that fits with two Apache core competencies · Egypt's fourth-largest producer, largest U.S. investor

Photo Right Apache expects to have approximately 9,000 square miles of 3-D seismic coverage in Egypt by year-end 2006, providing fodder for the company's skilled exploration teams.

Apache's technical teams is providing growth opportunities in Egypt for 2006 and beyond. According to industry reporting service IHS, Apache drilled 16 of the 33 total discoveries made in Egypt in 2005. We plan to drill about 175 wells in 2006, including 20 deep-Jurassic wells. In another transaction that closed in early 2006, Apache sold our undeveloped West Mediterranean deepwater gas assets for $413 million.In our view,we received a good price for an asset that would have required $550 million of additional investment and several years to bring online. Our highly skilled Apache Egypt technical staff will be able to concentrate on the long-term potential of our Western Desert core holding. Apache had not booked deepwater West Med reserves. In the North Sea, production from Apache's Forties Field increased 24 percent and reserves increased 12 percent in 2005 from 18 wells that added 45 million barrels.Since acquiring this field in 2003,Apache has invested $400 million to improve its efficiency and,as an added benefit,also reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. Forties is a legacy asset ­ the largest field ever discovered in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea, with cumulative production of 2.6 billion barrels. Our revised assessment, using the latest reservoir modeling technology, indicates that the field originally contained oil in place of approximately 5 billion barrels, about 800 million barrels above earlier estimates. Based on an estimated recovery factor of 60 percent, we think there may be an additional 300 million to 400 million barrels of recoverable reserve potential at Forties. With the 3-D seismic survey completed in 2005, we now have three different 3D surveys presenting snapshots at different times in the Forties Field's 30-year history, giving Apache's geoscientists an opportunity to use "4-D" seismic analysis. (The fourth dimension is time.) Using each survey, Apache's experts tracked how the seismic images changed over time, giving them a better sense of where to pick the next drilling locations. In 2006, we plan to drill 14 wells at Forties, which should enable continued strong reserve growth; we've also slated a five-well exploration program beyond Forties, including two high-potential wildcat wells. Our extensive acreage position in Australia provides further avenues for longterm growth, particularly in the Exmouth Basin, where we drilled five discoveries in 2003 and 2004 with gross reserves totaling about 300 million barrels. We are planning to begin an eight-well exploration program in 2006. In the shorter term, gas production will increase with commencement of the Burrup Fertilsers gas supply contract, which is contracted to add 50 million cubic feet per day. We are planning several Flag sandstone oil wells that provide

additional oil production potential. Apache added proved reserves of 32 MMboe in Australia in 2005. In January 2006, Apache announced an expanded commitment to Argentina through the purchase of Pioneer Natural Resources' assets in that country for $675 million. Although Argentina has suffered serious economic and political turmoil in recent years, we believe this major hydrocarbon-producing area is right for Apache based on our experience from a small operation there over the last five years; the country's favorable geology and sizable remaining oil and gas reserve potential; Argentina's improving economy and increasing energy demand; recent government moves to relax prices controls on natural gas; and exploration upside. Our exploitation core competency makes this transaction an excellent fit for both Apache and Argentina. Summing up, after 51 years of growth, Apache is in an excellent position to continue the trend. We have: · Large acreage positions and deep inventories of drilling prospects in proven oil and gas producing provinces; · Several completed transactions that provide reserves and/or acreage under favorable economic terms (good relationships with a number of other companies may provide additional opportunities); and · An aggressive and contrarian culture that will continue to drive Apache forward. We have presented Apache's strategy and outlook for continued growth. Now, we will discuss the factors that undermine our industry's ability to find and develop oil and gas to advance living standards. One lesson that hedge funds and other short-term players have learned is that capital can be moved across industries and across international borders on a moment's notice. Oil and gas producing nations ­ including our own government ­ should recognize this reality. There is a temptation to try to extract a greater share of the revenue stream from oil and gas exploration and production companies through taxes or contract terms.However,nations that succumb to such temptation will find fewer companies willing to invest in developing their resources. Less than 15 percent of the world's oil and gas resources are in private hands.The remainder is controlled by governments and state-owned oil companies. These entities must balance their nationalistic urge to control the revenue stream with the need to attract the capital and technical expertise to maximize their resources.

In the United States, the chronic failure of political leadership to develop energy policies that would encourage and sustain domestic production has increased price volatility and our dependence on unstable regions of the world as well as exacerbated the trade deficit.Now,with a perceived "crisis"of high prices and high demand, Congress is once again considering policy solutions. Little good is likely to emerge as the politicians preen for television rather than confront the issues. Because the basis of our business is providing commodities that are essential for advancing standards of living, we have applied Apache's sense of urgency and entrepreneurial culture to initiatives that share this same goal on a personto-person basis. Our employees invest their own time and money (which is matched by Apache) to support grassroots organizations in their communities throughout the world. In 2005, Apache supported 278 different causes from education to community service to youth programs to the arts. Apache focuses its philanthropic activity on education and life-long learning, broadly defined. We support the Ucross Foundation's artists in residence; holistic ranching and tree planting in Wyoming; Fund for Teachers' summer learning and exploration experiences for pre-kindergarten through high school teachers; and Springboard--Educating the Future's girl-friendly schools in rural Egypt. To learn more about these please see page 16 of this report. We live in a world and operate in an industry that constantly presents unanticipated challenges. Our goal at Apache remains to build an enterprise that can provide sustained growth throughout commodity price cycles, hundred-year storms and other surprises. We believe that our portfolio of core areas and our capable, energetic employees provide the means to achieve that goal. Thanks for sticking with us.
