  TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Overall, we were pleased with our performance in 2011. Demand for most of our products improved slowly and steadily through 2011 and that has continued into 2012. Metals pricing was volatile during the year, but generally was above 2010 levels, helping us to generate the second highest sales level in our history, as well as our fourth highest earnings per share. We continued to grow the Company, completing one acquisition in 2011 and another one in early 2012. We also spent $156 million for capital expenditures, our highest ever, most of which was growth related. Our strong balance sheet provided
a foundation for our 2011 activities and positions us well for continued growth, both organically and by additional acquisitions.
For the 2011 year, our net income was $343.8 million, up 77% from net income of $194.4 million in the 2010 year. Earnings per diluted share were $4.58 for 2011, up 75% from $2.61 in 2010. Sales in 2011 were $8.13 billion, up 29% from 2010 sales of $6.31 billion.
Our sales into the energy (oil & gas), and agricultural and mining equipment industries grew the most for us in 2011 over 2010. Sales into the aerospace, semiconductor & electronics, and auto industries (mainly through our toll processing businesses) also remained solid for us in 2011. Even non-residential construction improved some over 2010 but significantly lagged compared to our sales into other markets. Although we see positive momentum in the economic recovery that we expect to continue during 2012, overall demand is still below pre-recessionary levels.
Changes in the metals industry, mainly at the producer level and related to raw material costs, have led to higher pricing for most metals since 2004 but have also increased the volatility of metals pricing since then. In 2011 our gross profit margins declined to just below what we believe to be our normal range of 25% to 27%, mainly because of pricing volatility during the year. This volatility also caused uncertainty that increased the competitive environment and further pressured our gross profit margins. We expect pricing volatility will continue, but at manageable levels, which should allow us to increase our gross profit margins in 2012.

     PASSION
TO GROW
          
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS CONTINUED
We have focused our growth more in specialty products and in higher-growth end markets,
such as by acquiring Continental Alloys & Services, Inc., headquartered in Houston, Texas, and its affiliated companies, effective August 1, 2011. Continental was founded in 1976 and is a leading global materials management company centered on high-end steel and alloy pipe, tube and bar products and precision manufacturing of various tools designed for well completion programs of global energy service companies, with 12 locations in seven countries, including Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, the U.A.E., the United Kingdom and the United States. Continental and its affiliates had combined sales of $204.8 million in the five-month period from our acquisition date to December 31, 2011.
The acquisition of Continental increased our exposure to the fast growing energy market, expanded our product breadth to include Oil Country Tubular Goods (“OCTG”) products, added new, higher value-add processing services, such as CNC machining and threading and expanded our presence into new international markets.
Effective February 1, 2012, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Diamond Manufacturing Company, we acquired McKey Perforating Co., Inc., headquartered in New Berlin, Wisconsin and its subsidiary, McKey Perforated Products Co., Inc., located in Manchester, Tennessee. McKey was founded in 1867 and is a contract manufacturer that provides a full range of metal perforating and fabrication services to customers located primarily in the U.S. McKey’s net sales for 2011 were approximately $18 million.
We entered the perforating metals business in 2010 with our purchase of Diamond. McKey complements our presence in this market and brings certain products and processing services to our portfolio that we did not previously provide.
In 2011 we continued our internal growth initiatives by opening new facilities, building and expanding existing facilities and adding processing equipment through our capital expenditures. We believe that investing in the highest quality equipment and facilities allows us to consistently service our customers at the highest levels and enhances our quality and efficiency, which contributes to higher profits.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS CONTINUED
During 2011 our average order size was $1,590. We handled over 5.1 million transactions,
or 20,420 per business day, performed processing services on about 40% of these orders and delivered 45% of the orders to our customer’s facility within 24 hours from the time the customer placed the order with us.
We will continue to maintain our facilities and equipment at the highest standards to support our organic growth activities in 2012 with a capital expenditure budget of $250 million. We will evaluate each growth opportunity and execute on those that we believe have the highest return potential. The safety of our employees and others is also a top priority for us, and is supported by our investment in our facilities and equipment.
In 2011, we amended and restated our $1.1 billion unsecured credit facility for five years and increased the size to $1.5 billion. The restated credit facility includes an increase option for up to an additional $500 million and includes more favorable pricing terms than our prior facility that would have matured in November 2012. Other than pricing, the terms remained fairly consistent, including the financial covenants.
Our net debt-to-total capital ratio was only 28.4% at December 31, 2011, with $645 million outstanding on our new $1.5 billion credit facility, providing ample room for continued organic growth as well as additional acquisitions.
Given our strong financial condition and positive business outlook, our Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend by 25%, to $.15 per share from $.12 per share, effective with our 2012 first quarter dividend. The Company has paid regular quarterly dividends for 52 consecutive years and has increased its dividend 17 times since the 1994 IPO.
We have strong earnings capacity with our broad and diverse product base and wide geographic footprint that positions us well in our industry. We also have significant exposure to industries that are poised for growth in the years ahead. We will maintain our focus on maximizing the profitability of our existing businesses as well as continuing our growth through additional acquisitions that meet our strict criteria for accretive transactions.
