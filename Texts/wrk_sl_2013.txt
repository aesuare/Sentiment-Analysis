 Dear Shareholders:
Steven C. Voorhees
Chief Executive Officer
 RockTenn’s co-workers delivered exceptional results during fiscal 2013 in an economic environment characterized by stable demand for corrugated and consumer packaging and high operating rates across all of our paperboard grades.
We achieved record levels of net sales, adjusted earnings per share and credit agreement EBITDA. Compared to the prior fiscal year, sales increased by
4 percent to $9.5 billion, adjusted earnings per share increased by 63 percent to $7.30 per diluted share and
credit agreement EBITDA increased by 26 percent to $1.5 billion.
RockTenn generated $816 million, or $11.16 per share, in free cash flow that we applied to dividends, net debt repayment, acquisitions and investments, and pension funding in excess of expense. The $11.16 per share was 55 percent greater than fiscal 2012 and well in excess of the guidance of $650 to $675 million or about $9 per share we gave at the beginning of the year.

 We expect to continue to improve our business performance and generate strong free cash flow during fiscal 2014. Following are highlights of
our operating performance during fiscal 2013 and our outlook for fiscal 2014.
CORRUGATED PACKAGING
RockTenn’s corrugated packaging team delivered outstanding results in fiscal 2013, as demonstrated
4
by the 87 percent increase in segment income to $680 million and an increase in segment EBITDA margins from 12.7 percent in fiscal 2012 to 16.6 percent in fiscal 2013, an improvement of 390 basis points.
During fiscal 2013, we implemented two
$50 per-ton price increases, the first in September 2012 and the second in April 2013. While strong

 pricing and higher production favorably impacted our financial results, the compelling story of fiscal 2013 is told through the operating improvements and cultural transformation that occurred through- out the year and is continuing into fiscal 2014.
We have implemented pricing methodologies that allow better visibility and consistency in pricing across our box plant system; these methodologies supported the realization of the two price increases throughout the year. We have provided improved training and support to our entire sales force,
Packaging business
RockTenn’s Corrugated Packaging business is one of North America’s largest producers of containerboard and corrugated packaging. In 2013, strategic investments in many mills and converting facilities improved quality, reliability and operating costs.
Our investments, combined with our sales and commercial excellence initiatives, strengthened the company’s competitive position and helped deliver a 16.6 percent EBITDA margin in the Corrugated Packaging segment, an increase of 390 basis points over the prior year.
..............................................
A. Additional targeted capital investments, includ- 5 ing those at Solvay, NY, are slated for 2014.
B. Since 2011, the Cullman, AL, sheet plant has tripled revenues on its patented ComboPACTM
 bulk bins.
C. RockTenn’s patented Meta® 8 case, which uses up to 17 percent less fiber with equal stacking strength, serves agricultural, retail and com- mercial markets.
D. The Aston, PA, container plant is one of the year’s top performers in safety, quality, cost and productivity.

 allowing us to better meet the needs of our custom- ers, including the provision of value-added products and services.
We improved the cost structure of our box plant network by closing an additional seven corrugated container plants through the end of fiscal 2013, bringing the total closed since the Smurfit-Stone acquisition to 20. Our average box plant volumes have increased by 7 percent compared to the end of last year. The consolidation
of our box plant system is substantially complete with further closures being a function of changes in market conditions and/or specific plant performance.
During the course of fiscal 2014, we will complete the implementation of our new box plant operating system and invest in our box plants to improve quality, productivity and cost. We will install six new Mitsubishi EVOL flexo folder gluers in fiscal 2014; each EVOL will improve quality, productivity and cost by replacing between two and four existing flexos.

 RockTenn’s containerboard mills made significant
strides to improve our cost, reliability and quality in
fiscal 2013. Each of our major mill outages went
according to plan and achieved our desired results. At
the Hopewell, VA, linerboard mill, we upgraded the
paper machine’s primary headbox as well as a number
of related systems, which are now yielding significant
process variability reductions and improvements in
overall paper quality. During the June and November
2013 outages at our Hodge, LA, containerboard mill, milestones throughout the year.
Strategic investments drive mill performance
Major capital projects at our containerboard mills are yielding significant improvements.
RockTenn plans a total of $525 to $550 million in capital investments in fiscal 2014, the major- ity of which will be made in our containerboard mills to further improve quality, reliability and efficiency.

 Hopewell, scheduled for spring 2014. This project will replace the press section, add drying capacity and upgrade machine electrical drives. The combina- tion of these improvements will provide us the flexibility to produce an additional 114,000 tons
of linerboard annually or, depending on customer demand, produce the same number of tons we produce today at a lower cost. At our Florence, SC, mill, we will invest approximately $49 million to build a new wood yard and chip delivery system that
will improve quality and earn an attractive return by lowering our overall cost of wood.
We have improved the operation of our inte- grated corrugated packaging system by better matching our production with market demand.
We have improved the productivity of our paper machines and our customer service levels through the efforts of our people, better processes and improved supply chain systems.

 Demand for RockTenn’s containerboard began to soften during August and, consistent with our approach to match our production to meet the demand of our customers, we reduced our production levels by 60,000 tons in the September quarter.

CONSUMER PACKAGING
Our consumer packaging co-workers continued to operate very well with a focus on customer satisfac- tion and performance excellence. Sales were level with last year and income of $295 million declined from the prior year due to lower selling prices and increased commodity input costs. We increased prices for our consumer grades during the latter part of fiscal 2013 and are implementing the related

 contractual price increases during 2014. Currently, our supply and customer demand for our consumer paperboard grades are in balance.
Our Consumer Packaging business operates extremely well with very efficient processes and systems that result in high measured customer satisfaction. Our RTS Packaging business has earned the highest customer satisfaction ratings at RockTenn with ratings in excess of 9.4 out
of 10 for each of the last five years.
Packaging business
RockTenn is one of North America’s largest producers of recycled and solid bleached sulfate paperboard, folding cartons and interior packaging.
The Consumer Packaging business’ co-workers continue to deliver results that outpace the industry through their focus on customer satisfaction and operational excellence.

 A
 Over the past year, our folding carton system continued deployment of its performance excellence initiative to a second wave of five plants, achieving effi- ciency improvements by engaging and empowering co-workers throughout each of the plant locations. We expect to complete this initiative in all of our folding carton plants in fiscal 2014.
We will invest $68 million to construct a new biomass boiler at our Demopolis, AL, solid bleached sulfate mill that will efficiently convert biomass
waste from the facility to energy and address
the regulatory requirements of Boiler MACT. The biomass boiler, in combination with the 35 megawatt turbine generator that starts up in January 2014, will enable Demopolis to be up to 87 percent energy independent.
Merchandising Displays’ sales of $675 million in fiscal 2013 were a record for the business, capped by record monthly sales in September. We started off fiscal 2014 with another monthly sales record in

 October. During the year, we invested across the busi- ness to improve our capabilities with an emphasis at our Adams, WI; West Chester, OH; and Winston-Salem, NC, facilities. Additionally, we opened a new assembly location in Knoxville, TN. Beginning in the December quarter, we will report the Merchandising Displays business as its own segment, separate from the Consumer Packaging segment.
Profitably growing sales and volume
RockTenn’s folding carton group concentrates on profitably growing its sales and volume by operating fewer, larger and better capitalized plants with standardized processes. Invest- ments in 64-inch presses, finishing equipment and a new facility in the past two years enabled RockTenn to exceed the industry growth rate and yielded significant improve- ment in the average sales per plant.
............................................
A, D. Finishing equipment like the new flame sealer at the Claremont folding carton plant seals cartons without glue and increases productivity while lowering costs.
B. New backside printing capabilities at the Conover folding carton plant have added significant incremental revenue by creating promotional options for a major customer.
C. Co-workers set world production records on the 64-inch, seven-color press, installed at the Conover folding carton plant. The company plans to invest in additional wide- format printing equipment to support growth.

Satisfying customers
 from CONCEPT TO CHECKOUT®
Providing full-service design expertise, RockTenn’s Merchandising Displays business is the industry leader in North America. Record- setting sales for the fiscal year are indicative of the company’s ability to leverage its strong network of manufacturing plants, fulfillment facilities, and sales and design centers to provide innovative designs and exceptional cus- tomer service to every customer, every time.
............................................
A. The Knoxville, TN, assembly facility was opened in 2013 to support the growth of a large customer.
B. Driven by employee participation in initia- tives like “Courage to Care,” RockTenn’s
Lost Work Day rate, a primary measure of incident severity, was reduced by 40 percent companywide.
C. The company’s Merchandising Displays business, which includes Knoxville, won more Design of the Times and POPAI awards this year than any other company.
RECYCLING
RockTenn’s recycling business plays a critical role by managing approximately 7.5 million tons of recycled fiber annually, including approximately four million tons consumed by our paper mills and approximately 700,000 tons of converting scrap generated within the company. We operate 24 plant locations where we aggregate and bale recovered materials for sale to domestic and export markets. Our trading hub in

 Atlanta coordinates this activity and supplements our market requirements with third-party volumes to profitably balance our system. We have rational- ized our operations over the past two years and this resulted in our income doubling in fiscal 2013 on 9 percent less volume than the prior year.
PRODUCTIVITY
At the time of the completion of the Smurfit-Stone acquisition, we set a goal of achieving a $550 million
annual run rate of synergies and performance improvements by the end of December 2013. We achieved this goal through a relentless focus on capturing the opportunities available to us; in fiscal 2013, our productivity improvements increased pre- tax earnings by $223 million, as compared to the prior year. RockTenn’s success depends on continued productivity improvements to more than offset the impact of the inflation embedded in many of our costs.

                           ROCKTENN | 2013 ANNUAL REPORT
 
 A
 We expect to achieve an additional $100 to $150 mil- lion in productivity improvements in fiscal 2014.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY
We applied $567 million of our fiscal 2013 free cash flow to net debt reduction. Net debt declined by
17 percent to $2.8 billion or less than two times credit agreement EBITDA. Our two times targeted leverage ratio balances the use of leverage to enhance returns
16
with the availability of additional leverage to take advantage of strategic opportunities when they arise.
RockTenn’s prioritization of uses of cash flow starts with investing to maintain and improve our businesses. We plan to invest between $525 and $550 million back into our businesses in fiscal 2014, higher than our capital expenditures of $440 million in fiscal 2013.

 Sustainably sourcing the recycled mills

 We will identify and invest additional capital through acquisitions to the extent the acquisition opportunities make us a better business. We will repurchase RockTenn stock as a means to maintain our target leverage.
We will maintain our financial strength and flexi- bility as part and parcel of successfully generating attractive long-term returns for our shareholders.
Emphasizing quality, profitability and supply to its mills over volume, RockTenn now oper- ates 24 recycling facilities – 15 fewer than
at the time of the Smurfit-Stone acquisition. Five of those facilities are single-stream plants that use innovative technologies such as screens and optical sorters to process recycled materials without the need for cus- tomers to presort. This capability is attractive to customers as it reduces their costs.

Message from the Non-Executive Chairman
RockTenn lost a remarkable leader when
Jim Rubright retired. Under his leadership, RockTenn’s share price increased more
than sevenfold and with dividends, earned a compound annual return of 17.4 percent –
for 14 years. Jim earned a well-deserved reputation as an outstanding leader dedicated
to serving RockTenn customers, employees
and shareholders. We wish Jim all the best in
his future endeavors. We are thrilled to now have Steve Voorhees as RockTenn’s new CEO. During his 14-year tenure at RockTenn, Steve has played a significant role in developing our culture and strategy. I look forward to working with Steve and our 26,000 RockTenn co-workers as we continue RockTenn’s journey.
