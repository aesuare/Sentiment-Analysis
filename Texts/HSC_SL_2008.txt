Fellow Shareholders:
It’s one thing to achieve record results when times are good. It’s another to still perform well under adverse conditions. Historians will view the current financial and economic crisis as arguably the most challenging and turbulent period of our generation. During the unprecedented turmoil of 2008 we contended with declining global steel production, an extremely volatile U.S. dollar, dramatic fluctuations in fuel costs, freezing of credit markets and delayed and cancelled customer orders. By the fourth quarter, the world
deepened into a recessionary decline that continues to test the fortitude of companies and investors alike. We responded by drawing on our strengths—our diverse industrial services capabilities, our strong balance sheet, our expanding global footprint and our operating discipline. We proactively implemented countermeasures that will significantly lower our cost structure and deliver immediate benefit in 2009.
I am proud to report that, excluding a relatively modest restructuring charge in the fourth quarter, we achieved another full year of record performance.
We also invested in our future by embracing Harsco’s core ideology throughout the organization. I believe the best way to scale our Company’s culture across the globe is to adopt a singular purpose supported by uniform values.This shared commitment will help us build an enduring enterprise that will create sustainable shareholder value for years to come.
essential Services
Harsco is a different kind of industrial services company. We support customers that are doing the important work that underpins economic growth and development around the world. As one analyst recently remarked, Harsco’s services are “critical to the global way of life.” Our human capital and worldwide equipment help leading infrastructure construction companies build the new power plants, airports, highways and municipal and industrial facilities that create jobs, expand commerce and improve quality of life. We work onsite to support metals and steel producers as they forge the raw materials used in everything from skyscrapers, stadiums and bridges to
ships, cars and railways.The co-products we recover from metals production and coal combustion contribute to environmentally friendly manufacturing processes and provide building blocks for specialized industrial products. And the railway expansion and maintenance projects we support fuel economic growth by enabling the efficient movement of goods and people.
This work continues all the time, in developed and emerging global markets. And because we can deploy and scale our mobile assets wherever they’re needed, we can engineer sustainable growth during most economic cycles.
execution Focus
Our fifth consecutive year of record revenues has better positioned Harsco for even greater success when economic conditions improve.
• Revenues grew 8 percent to approximately $4 billion.
• Income from continuing operations, before a fourth quarter restructuring charge, increased more than 5.3 percent.
• Cash flow from operations reached a record $574 million, an increase of 22 percent.
• We invested $248 million in growth capital and repurchased nearly 4.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock.
• We retained our investment-grade A rating.
This performance confirms the value of our diverse portfolio of global businesses. We generated continued growth in our Harsco Infrastructure group by repositioning

our highly engineered rental assets and building a strong growth presence in the Middle East Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states and other key emerging markets. Revenues from Harsco Metals were essentially flat as economic factors forced customers to slow metals production and accelerate scheduled maintenance shutdowns. We held the line by renegotiating or exiting unfavorable long-term contracts. Our Harsco Minerals businesses confronted the difficult climate with refocused energy and direction for their reclamation and recycling services. Our Harsco Rail business continued to grow as we started deliveries on our record China contract and expanded our presence in Brazil. And Harsco Industrial’s market-leading portfolio enabled this business to operate at high capacity.
With the proactive fourth quarter 2008 countermeasures that we implemented, coupled with our strong balance sheet, Harsco enters 2009 on a solid foundation. We are prepared to confront the deepening global economic uncertainty that we expect throughout the year. No one can predict how severe these challenges will be or when the recovery will begin. As a global business, we also expect the soaring U.S. dollar to create particularly strong adverse headwinds throughout the year—as it did in the fourth quarter of 2008. Nevertheless, we have a solid track record of managing through turbulent times. And looking forward, many Harsco businesses stand to benefit either directly or indirectly from the global economic stimulus packages that will fund new infrastructure projects. Harsco Infrastructure and Harsco Minerals & Rail should benefit directly. Harsco Metals is also likely to see increased
activity throughout its global mill services footprint, because steel and other metals are essential materials in these types of projects.
commitment to Value
Harsco wins by understanding how customers define value and by building robust service and product portfolios that align our expertise, resources and global network to provide Insight onsite.TM We are equally committed to creating wealth and value for shareholders, and one way we do so is through our unwavering commitment to Economic Value Added (EVA®). This enterprise-wide metric provides a consistent and transparent way to translate strategy into investment decisions and compensate all key managers in the Company based on performance. We have also sharpened our focus by welcoming three new directors to our Board who bring tremendous global business experience as well as strong perspectives on EVA and continuous improvement. EVA discipline also drove our restructuring initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2008. As the economic climate deteriorated, we took necessary countermeasures that included rationalizing facilities, renegotiating contracts, amending benefit plans and trimming our global workforce.These initiatives should save more than $50 million per year, with a majority of these cost savings being realized beginning in 2009.
Going forward, EVA will reflect the results from the LeanSigma® continuous improvement projects that are now beginning to flourish across the Company. We completed 40 Kaizen events in 2008 that span

manufacturing, service and office operations, and we expect this number to increase to over 200 in 2009 and reach approximately 400 by 2010. I am convinced that LeanSigma, coupled with our rigorous and disciplined implementation, will be transformational for Harsco.
a Strong and Flexible Balance Sheet
Backed by the discipline of EVA, our well-balanced, diversified portfolio once again generated the strong
cash flows we use to finance our business and expand
our geographic footprint. In 2008 our discretionary cash flow—that is, cash from operations less maintenance capital expenditures—increased to a record $365 million. That gave us the resources to invest 54 percent of this year’s record capital expenditures, or approximately $248 million, in critical growth initiatives such as our robust emerging markets strategy. Investments in 2008 should help us reach our goal of generating 30 percent of our revenues from these fast-growing markets by 2010–2011. Our target is 40 percent by 2018. Our Infrastructure footprint includes such strategically important emerging markets as the GCC states and the Asia/Pacific region. Our Metals business is also pursuing market expansion with new opportunities there as well. And we are responding
to inquiries from around the world about our innovative railway track maintenance and co-product recycling technologies. Abundant cash flows also provide a critical advantage during turbulent times. With three years of significant growth investment behind us, we can scale back additional growth investments in 2009 until conditions

improve, and instead redeploy the cash to reduce debt, pursue selective acquisitions and repurchase our stock.
Harsco enters 2009 with the capital structure and financial strength that many companies would envy, especially in today’s environment. We executed a 10-year bond issue of $450 million in May 2008 at a very favorable interest rate, leaving us with much less exposure to floating debt while extending our average debt maturities. We also renewed $220 million and $30 million credit facilities that bring our total short-term borrowing capacity to $700 million. At December 31, 2008 we have a strong liquidity position and a very manageable debt-to-capital ratio of 41.7 percent.
Building an enduring enterprise
Beginning in 2009, Harsco moves forward as one company, with a single unified Harsco brand identity.That means every Harsco business will benefit from the integrated financial resources, best practices and market position of a strong global organization. Our focus on our core ideology will create meaningful opportunities for our employees as we continue to assess our global talent base and support the professional growth and development of our human capital. I appreciate and respect the hard work of our people as we continue to build our global leadership team and strengthen our intellectual infrastructure. I am also grateful for the genuine commitment that our team has demonstrated by embracing and embedding the LeanSigma core value in our culture. LeanSigma will transform our business and make us a smarter and more productive organization. Harsco’s core purpose is to build

 teams that win with integrity anywhere in the world. We will continue to embrace the values and ethical business practices that earn the trust and respect of customers—and of one another.
Misperceptions often take root during troubled times, even for globally balanced and diversified companies. Winston Churchill once said that “Facts are better than dreams.” I am proud to remind our shareholders of our unique business profile and the powerful attributes we possess. Harsco is:
• A global leader of industrial services and products, with a balanced and globally scalable portfolio of business platforms;
• A company with a clear path to growth through targeted organic growth opportunities, joint ventures and prudent acquisitions;
• A culture of professionals who share a strong core purpose and core values that empower us to win through integrity, teamwork and discipline;
• A strong and financially sound company.
