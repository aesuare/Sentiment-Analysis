DEAR

CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS,
For 114 years, our focus has been on our customers. We have been most successful when we view our business through their eyes. In today's rapidly changing retail landscape, this approach has never been more important, so our strategy remains squarely focused on serving customers on their terms. Knowing customers increasingly desire an experience that's both personalized and convenient, we continue to make investments that further integrate our store and online experience to enable our customers to shop seamlessly any way they choose.

It's only one market though. We still have a lot to learn about serving Canadians and will continue learning from each community as we expand further. On March 6, 2015, we opened a store in Ottawa, Ontario, and we will open another in Vancouver, British Columbia, on September 18. Both stores are in terrific retail locations, and we look forward to serving more customers in Canada in the coming years. In 2014, we also opened new stores in the United States at The Woodlands Mall in The Woodlands, Texas, and St. Johns Town Center in Jacksonville, Florida. Both these stores and those in Canada opened with our new store design, reflecting an energized

continued growth of Nordstrom.com. First, we've expanded Nordstrom.com selection by three times from three years ago, so customers have greater choice of their favorite brands. Second, a great mobile experience is a vital link to many customers, and we are working hard behind the scenes to improve this experience. We have enhanced our mobile app with localized inventory and personalized homepage features, and more features are coming this year. We are also opening a fulfillment center in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania, in 2015 that, when combined with our fulfillment center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and our Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook fulfillment center in San Bernardino, California, will greatly increase our capabilities.

In January 2015, the Retail Design Institute recognized Nordstrom The Woodlands with First Place for a New or Remodeled Department Store and Innovation in Store Planning. We appreciate their recognition, but the true measure of success will come from our customers' experiences in our new stores. In addition to our two new stores in Canada this year, we'll also open stores in Puerto Rico, Milwaukee and a second store in Minneapolis, which has long been a terrific market for us. We are also mindful of serving customers better through product, speed and convenience. Expanded merchandise selection and growing customer adoption of mobile shopping are two factors contributing to the

Finally, in 2014, we acquired Trunk Club, a high-growth personalized men's clothing business based on a service model that is highly complementary to our own. We believe Trunk Club is a natural extension of our business, and together we will continue to evolve and bring together the online and o ine worlds to deliver a great shopping experience.

of 300 stores by 2020. Customers continue to respond favorably to the treasure-hunt experience that defines Nordstrom Rack stores. As we expand in many markets for the first time, we hope to continue delivering a great experience, as this business represents a terrific opportunity for us to attract new customers. Last year, Nordstrom Rack was our biggest source of new customers, attracting nearly 4 million. Also, a year ago, we began accepting returns of HauteLook and Nordstromrack.com merchandise at any Nordstrom Rack store. This drove nearly 1 million trips to Nordstrom Rack stores in 2014. The Nordstrom Rack customer also tends to be younger than our full-line customer, and there is a meaningful opportunity for these customers to begin shopping our full-price channels as well. We plan to open 27 more Nordstrom Racks in 2015 across the U.S.

I love how you used models with physical challenges in your Anniversary catalog. Nice work!

We increased the number of full-line stores with Topshop to 53 and launched Kate Moss for Topshop, which helped us rapidly grow the number of Topshop customers, including a younger customer who in many cases is new to Nordstrom. By the end of 2015, we plan to have Topshop in more than 80 stores. This March, we were excited to begin carrying Madewell, representing a new partnership with J.Crew. Our initial launch was on Nordstrom.com and in 15 of our stores in our t.b.d. department.

A NOTE FROM OUR

CHAIRMAN
Our top priority at Nordstrom is to improve our customers' experience, continuously. This priority challenges us each day and is the basis for our long-term strategy to provide all Nordstrom customers with a best-in-class experience centered on service, product and capabilities, whenever and wherever they want. This commitment to Nordstrom customers is, in itself, the foundation of the deep and shared commitment of the Board of Directors and management to our shareholders--to enhance shareholder value over the long run through capital allocation discipline and to hold ourselves accountable for financial results. About a decade ago, we began investing strategically in the company's multi-channel capabilities across stores and online to meet the changing expectations of our customers. Investing early in technology, merchandising and stores, as well as integrating the in-store and online experience, helped position the company to achieve exceptional growth and superior returns. For the last several years, we further accelerated our level of investment to fuel growth across all our businesses--full-price, o -price, stores and online--to help Nordstrom deliver strong results this year and support profitable growth for years to come. We expect these investments to drive long-term shareholder value. As the Board of Directors looks back on the many accomplishments of 2014 and ahead to the future, we support our executive management team led by Blake, Pete and Erik Nordstrom. We view 2014 to be a watershed moment in our history, with the successful entry into Canada, the expansion of the Rack business through store growth, the launch of Nordstromrack.com and the acquisition of Trunk Club. These milestones are the outcome of our strategy, which is squarely focused on serving customers on their terms and delivering the Nordstrom experience they expect from us. More importantly, our forward-thinking strategy puts us on track to achieve our goal of top-quartile shareholder return, driven by high single-digit sales growth and mid-teens return on invested capital. We believe this will lead us to be a $20 billion business by 2020, with superior returns, creating significant shareholder value. The hard work and performance of the team have not gone unnoticed. Fortune magazine recently published their annual ranking of the World's Most Admired Companies, listing Nordstrom at #14. This is the seventh consecutive year we've appeared in the Top 50. Additionally, Nordstrom was ranked number one among all companies for quality of product/services. Within our peer group of general merchandisers, we ranked number one overall as well as for innovation, people management, use of corporate assets, quality of management, long-term investment value and quality of products/services. These accolades reflect the vision, high achievement and values we believe the company stands for, and the dedication and hard work of more than 67,000 Nordstrom employees. This past February, we were fortunate to add Shellye Archambeau to the Board of Directors. As the chief executive o cer of MetricStream, Inc., we believe Shellye enhances an already strong Board that is deeply committed to the highest standards of ethics, accountability and governance. As we look to the future, we know that change will be a constant and that the Nordstrom strategy must evolve with customers' expectations, as must the means by which we enhance shareholder value. However, most importantly, the core principles upon which Nordstrom was built will not change. Your Board of Directors and your management team are committed to maintaining the company's unmatched competitive spirit and unyielding commitment to serve and value our customers, employees and shareholders. Be assured that Nordstrom and its wonderful employees are well positioned to deliver the best customer experience possible in ever-innovative ways, creating value for our shareholders in the years to come. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors, thank you for your continued support of Nordstrom.

I've found that Nordstrom employees go to great lengths to please the customer. That's hard to find in most stores these days.
OUR CUSTOMER, SUSAN F.
