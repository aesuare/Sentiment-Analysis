SHAREHOLDERS’ LETTER
This past year was significant not just for our strong financial results, but also for our strategic accomplishments.
In many respects, 2004 was a milestone year for our Company, from celebrating the 30th anniversary of the opening of our first Foot Locker store in City of Industry, California, to opening our first Foot Locker store in the Republic of Ireland. It was also a year of continued momentum and strong financial performance for our Company. The progress we made in 2004, including our expanded global store base and improved array of merchandise, posi- tions us for additional success in the future.
The year 2004 can be summarized as follows: our sales broke through the $5 billion mark and, by year's end, we were operating nearly 4,000 stores world- wide. Moreover, Foot Locker, Inc. signifi- cantly increased its net income per share and increased shareholder value by using its strong cash flow to reinvest in the business and pay increased dividends. In addition, most of our key financial meas- urements – including sales per average gross square foot, operating profit, net income and shareholders' equity – have increased meaningfully. Our pride in our consistent and improving results is matched by our total dedication to enhancing value for our shareholders over the long term.

2004 Year in Review
Earlier this decade, the Company estab- lished two key financial objectives: increasing our annual sales per average gross square foot to $350 and reaching an operating profit margin of 8.5 percent. We made significant strides towards attaining these objectives in 2004 – achieving annual sales per average gross square foot of $345 and an operating profit margin of 7.3 percent – and believe these goals are within our grasp. As a result, we are now targeting our longer- term goal of a 10 percent operating prof- it margin, a goal we aim to achieve with- in the next several years.
Our confidence is underpinned by the financial results that we have delivered. Our sales increased significantly in 2004, reaching $5.4 billion, a 12 percent increase from $4.8 billion in 2003. More importantly, income from continuing operations increased 22 percent in 2004 to $255 million.
Disciplined
remains a cornerstone of our strategy. We continue to strengthen our financial posi- tion while building our Company's future and our shareholders' returns. The Company ended 2004 in a strong financial position, with total cash and short-term investments of $492 million. Our busi- nesses continue to generate strong cash

flow that we are carefully redeploying to deliver increased value for our sharehold- ers by:
• Investing in worldwide growth
• Enhancing the productivity of existing businesses
• Strengthening our balance sheet
• Providing a meaningful cash return to our shareholders
Investing in our Worldwide Growth
This past year was significant not just for our strong financial results, but also for our strategic accomplishments. First and foremost, investing in meaningful world- wide growth for our Company is essential to our future.
In 2004, we completed the acquisition of two important businesses – the 349- store Footaction chain in the United States, and 11 athletic stores in the Republic of Ireland. We expect the finan- cial returns from these acquisitions to exceed our cost of capital by a meaning- ful margin and profits to be accretive to earnings per share in 2005 and beyond. The Footaction brand, which is well known across the United States, is antic- ipated to be complementary to our exist- ing businesses and important in generat- ing top-line growth. Footaction's value to

 our Company has been enhanced through the successful integration of its operation into the Foot Locker infrastructure.
We are also excited about our expan- sion into the Republic of Ireland, the 14th European country in which we operate retail stores. We believe Europe continues to offer the most exciting opportunities for sales and profit growth over the next several years, and as a result, we plan to continue opening new Foot Locker stores in strategic locations across this region. Looking farther afield, we believe that the Asia/Pacific region presents an excel- lent opportunity for growth over the longer term.
Productivity Enhancements
Aggressive global growth was only part of the bigger picture. We also continued to focus on implementing several strategies designed to enhance the sales and profits of our existing businesses. These ongoing productivity enhancements are aimed at the compatible goals of driving increased sales per average gross square foot and decreasing the Company's operating expenses as a percentage of sales.
Our success as a retailer depends on meeting the needs and wants of our cus- tomers. We at Foot Locker have long prid-
ed ourselves on providing best-in-class customer service. During 2004, we took several steps to enhance our future com- parable-store sales by implementing new, and improving existing, programs designed to attract new customers while better serving existing ones. These initia- tives include a new loyalty card program, enhanced gift card presentations and an automated stock-locator system, each of which were intregrated within the new point-of-sale system that we finished installing in our U.S. stores this year.
Meeting the needs of our customers also depends on providing an attractive store environment in a convenient loca- tion. During 2004, Foot Locker, Inc. com- pleted over 750 real estate projects. These projects included acquiring 360 stores, opening 96 new stores in strong consumer markets, closing 99 underper- forming older stores, and relocating and remodeling 225 stores to right-size and enhance their appearance. We have also worked with our landlords to optimize the tenancy-cost structure of additional stores. As a result, our total occupancy costs, as a percentage of sales, decreased versus last year.
In 2004, we also continued to work aggressively toward reducing our selling, general and administrative expenses as a
percentage of sales. Our success in meet- ing this objective resulted from the col- lective efforts of our associates world- wide. We are committed to an ongoing effort aimed at containing the growth of our operating expenses to a rate below that of our sales increases.
Strengthening our Balance Sheet
Another ongoing key objective has been strengthening our Company's financial position in an effort to achieve an invest- ment-grade credit rating. We have made great strides towards this objective in 2004:
• $150 million of 5.5% convertible notes were converted to equity
• Federal income tax return examina- tions through fiscal 2003 were com- pleted, resulting in a $47 million reduction of income tax liabilities
• The Company's underfunded pension liability was reduced by $71 million
• $200 million revolving credit facility was amended and restated, with its term extended to 2009
• New five-year, $175 million term loan was negotiated with our existing bank group
• Champs Sports is acquired.
• First European Foot Locker store opens in Germany.

 We are confident that increased earnings per share will result from continued implementation of the strategic priorities which have generated so much of our recent success.
In February 2004, Moody's Investors Services increased the Company's credit rating to Ba1, citing improved operating performance and financial position. While we are encouraged by this progress, we remain focused on continuing to improve our credit ratings. In the meantime, we believe that our capital structure effi- ciently supports our existing business and that we have excess borrowing capacity should appropriate additional investment opportunities arise.
Shareholder Returns
We remain firmly committed to providing our shareholders with a meaningful cash return – in addition to capital apprecia- tion – on their investment. With this goal in mind, and reflecting confidence in the ability of management to continue to grow the Company profitably, in November 2004, the Board of Directors increased the cash dividend on Foot Locker, Inc.'s common stock by 25 per- cent to an annualized amount of $0.30 per share.
Looking Forward
As we enter 2005, we are confident that increased earnings per share will result from continued implementation of the strategic priorities outlined above, which

In addition, we would also like to take this opportunity to thank our suppliers, landlords and other business partners who assist us in providing exceptional goods and services to our valued cus- tomers.
As we approach the midpoint of the current decade, we already have many achievements that we can highlight, from worldwide growth to increased productiv- ity, from a strengthened financial posi- tion to solid operating and financial per- formance. Ultimately, however, our strategies, goals and initiatives are all designed to achieve one overall commit- ment: building shareholder value for the long-term. We look forward to continuing to deliver on this commitment to share- holders and are excited about the bright prospects for our Company.
Sincerely,

have generated so much of our recent suc- cess. Substantial growth opportunities have been identified and are being careful- ly pursued as we expand in the global mar- ketplace. Capital expenditures of $170 mil- lion are planned for 2005, primarily target- ed towards opening new stores, remodel- ing and relocating existing stores, and maintaining an efficient infrastructure.
Critical to our continued success is the ongoing hard work and dedication of our associates at all levels worldwide. They are the backbone of our excellent infrastruc- ture, and their efforts solidly position our Company for the future. The outstanding talent base that we possess represents, in our view, a clear competitive advantage over others that compete in the athletic retail industry. At each of our operating divisions, the management teams are deep in both talent and years of experience. Our corporate sales support functions – including Sourcing, Logistics, Real Estate, Finance, Information Systems, Human Resources, Marketing and Legal – provide a solid foundation that enables our busi- nesses to grow profitably.
Our Company is fortunate to benefit from the strategic direction and counsel of a Board of Directors that comprises individuals with a wide range of expert- ise. In February 2005, we welcomed to our Board Alan D. Feldman, President and
