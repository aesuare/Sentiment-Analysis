To Our Shareholders

Ken Powell Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Fiscal 2010 was an exceptional year for General Mills. We achieved broad-based sales growth for our leading food brands in markets around the globe. Our earnings increased at a strong double-digit rate. And we made significant investments in product innovation, media support and selling capabilities that we believe will help drive continued growth for our company in 2011 and beyond.
Net sales grew 1 percent as reported. However, 2010 was a 52-week fiscal year compared to 53 weeks in fiscal 2009. We also divested some product lines in 2009. These differences reduced our 2010 sales growth by 3 percentage points. Segment operating profit grew 8 percent. And our earnings per share (EPS) rose 18 percent to $2.24. This EPS figure reflects the two-for-one split of General Mills stock with a record date of May 28, 2010. It also includes two items that affect the comparability of our results year-over-year. Those items were mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions and a tax charge taken in the fourth quarter to reflect the impact of recent federal health care legislation. Excluding these items, EPS was $2.30, up 16 percent from 2009 earnings of $1.99 per share excluding certain items affecting comparability. We believe this represents very strong financial performance in a challenging operating environment. We recorded sales gains across our businesses. In our $10 billion U.S. Retail segment, every division increased sales, despite one less week in this year's results. In our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, reported sales declined due to the absence of product

lines we divested and index pricing tied to wheat markets that were below prior-year levels. However, our sales grew in targeted foodservice channels, outpacing industry trends. And we posted good performance on a constant-currency basis across our international operations.

We managed our input costs well, realizing a 3 percent decline in supply chain costs from the previous year's levels. In addition, we generated significant cost savings with our Holistic Margin Management (HMM) efforts. HMM is our companywide discipline to identify and eliminate costs in our businesses that don't add value for the consumer. These cost savings initiatives, together with strong plant performance and input cost deflation, resulted in significant gross margin expansion in 2010. Consequently, we were able to invest at above-planned levels in

activities and resources that drive ongoing net sales growth. This included additional advertising investment, robust new product launches, and new or enhanced sales capabilities. Even with this strong reinvestment in our business, we delivered double-digit earnings growth. Our good financial performance was reflected in solid price appreciation for our stock in 2010, and we increased our dividend 12 percent. In total, stock price appreciation plus dividends resulted in a 43 percent total return to General Mills shareholders for the year. This exceeded our peer group's performance, and was double the S&P 500 Index's return of 21 percent. As we look ahead, we see excellent prospects for General Mills to build on our long-term record of generating superior returns to shareholders. We remain committed to our long-term growth model, which is shown in the table below. We believe it focuses our organization on delivering consistent, high-quality sales and earnings growth.

expect segment operating profit to grow faster than sales, increasing at a mid single-digit pace. And we're targeting high single-digit earnings per share growth before any mark-tomarket effects. We have tremendous strengths to build on in fiscal 2011 and beyond. Our brands hold leading market positions in categories that are on-trend with growing consumer groups: the world's baby-boom generation, many of whom are over age 55 today; the millennial generation, ages 16 to 33; and multicultural consumers of all ages. We have a sustainable business model, in which our gross margins generate funds to reinvest in product innovation and marketing efforts that drive sales growth. We remain focused on five key business drivers that fuel our overall success. They are: Innovation Brand building · Leading customer growth · International expansion · Margin expansion

We're innovating to improve our established brands and to create successful new products. Back in 2005, we challenged ourselves to improve the health credentials of our brands. As of fiscal 2010, U.S. Retail brands accounting for 60 percent of segment sales have been improved. We also had a strong lineup of successful new product introductions in 2010, including Chocolate Cheerios, Yoplait Delights yogurt parfaits, Wanchai Ferry frozen entrees, and Betty Crocker gluten free dessert mixes.

We're supporting our brands with increased levels of media spending. In fiscal 2010, our worldwide advertising and media spending reached $908 million, a 24 percent increase over the prior year. In fact, since 2007, our annual media investment has increased by more than $400 million. Our largest percent increases have been on digital and multicultural media. We're reaching more multicultural consumers, particularly the

fast-growing Hispanic population, through increased television, print and online advertising. We're partnering with retailers of all types to drive sales growth. While the majority of our sales today are with traditional grocery retailers, food sales in nontraditional outlets, such as supercenters, drug, discount and club stores, are growing faster. We're collaborating with all these customers on package formats, in-store merchandising events and online marketing. We're also applying our consumer insights capabilities, identifying consumer shopping behaviors and optimal store shelf assortments. In the nearly half a trillion dollar U.S. market for food eaten away from home, we're focused on the channels with the best opportunities for future growth, including foodservice distributors, schools, hospitals and lodging chains. We're also adding distribution of our products in the growing convenience store channel and bringing our category management skills to these outlets. We're growing sales for our brands in international markets, too. Net sales for our wholly owned International business grew 4 percent in fiscal 2010. Segment operating profit was lower for the year due to foreign currency effects. Adjusting for currency effects, operating profit grew by double digits despite increased levels of media investment in this business. We're focused on four key product platforms --cereal, super-premium ice cream, convenient meals, and wholesome snacks --to drive growth in developed markets and in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil. We're also partners in two international joint ventures, Häagen-Dazs Japan and Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW).

*Not consolidated. See page 87 of our 2010 Annual Report for discussion of non-GAAP measures.

After-tax earnings from these joint ventures increased 11 percent in 2010 to reach $102 million. CPW operates in 130 markets outside of North America and posted 6 percent net sales growth in fiscal 2010. Our wholly owned International businesses combined with our proportionate share of joint ventures generate nearly $4 billion in net sales today. As consumers worldwide look for more wholesome and convenient foods, we expect our international businesses will be our fastest growing in the years ahead. Our companywide focus on margin management is generating funds to reinvest in our businesses. We expect to see renewed input cost inflation in 2011, so our HMM efforts will remain critical in helping us offset increasing costs. Our pipeline of HMM ideas is robust. We're taking a broader look at our supply chain by including our customers and suppliers when identifying cost-saving opportunities. And we'll benefit from our growing international business as we're sharing our HMM ideas across countries. From fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012, we expect to achieve a cumulative $1 billion in savings from initiatives that reduce our cost of goods sold. Many of our HMM initiatives have a positive impact on the environment, reducing our water and energy usage rates. You can read more about these environmental benefits in our 2010 Corporate Social Responsibility Report available on our website. General Mills' exceptional performance is the result of the hard work of our 33,000 employees around the world. It is their collective talent and dedication that gives me great confidence

in our ability to deliver continued high-quality growth and achieve our long-term goals. In closing, I'd like to thank you for your investment in General Mills. My colleagues and I think it is a great time to be in the food business. Our food categories are well-positioned to meet the needs of today's consumers in markets around the world. We appreciate your confidence in our company's prospects, and we look forward to reporting on our future progress. Sincerely,
