 LETTER TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE BOEING COMPANY
Over the past 100 years, generations of talented Boeing employees helped build the world’s largest aerospace company—and shaped the course of history with amazing innovations along the way. In that time, human beings went from walking on Earth to walking on the moon, and from riding horses to flying jet airplanes and spaceships. With each decade, aerospace technology crossed another frontier, and with each crossing, the world changed.
    Standing now at the beginning of our second century, the opportunity for further discovery and achievement is as vast and exciting for us as it was for Bill Boeing and the other pioneers of aviation a century ago. Drawing on our founders’ passion for innovation, integrity and technical excellence, we are eager and ready to solve the world’s toughest chal- lenges for our customers and embrace the unique role our company plays in global advancement.
As we recognize our accomplishments of the past year, and review our strong financial and market positions, our eyes are fixed on the future and our commitment to build an even bigger, better Boeing and an even stronger team for winning in our second century.
2015 REVIEW
Thanks to the tremendous efforts of more than 160,000 employees and our global partners, Boeing extended its leadership of the aerospace industry in 2015 with record deliveries and revenues at Boeing Commercial Airplanes and solid sales and healthy margins in Boeing Defense, Space & Security.
We continued to deliver on our strategies to convert our record backlog into profitable growth; drive productivity and greater affordability throughout the company; and invest in our people, products and services to strengthen and grow our businesses for the future. We also demonstrated our commitment to provide increasing returns and significant cash to our shareholders.

Dennis A. Muilenburg Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

 Total company revenues rose 6 percent in 2015 to
a record $96.1 billion, and new orders for our market-leading products and services worth $83 bil- lion sustained our backlog at a near-record total of $489 billion.
Core earnings per share of $7.72* for the year reflected strong operating performance across the company, offset by charges taken on the KC-46A tanker and 747 programs. Core operating earnings reached $7.7 billion*, and operating cash flow increased 6 percent year-over-year to $9.4 billion.
We also continued our balanced cash deployment strategy by repurchasing 47 million shares for
$6.8 billion and paying $2.5 billion in dividends. In December 2015, based on our consistently strong cash generation and positive outlook, the Boeing board of directors raised our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion and increased the quar- terly dividend 20 percent.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported record revenue of $66 billion in 2015 fueled by an industry- record 762 deliveries that extended our global market-share lead for a fourth consecutive year.
By capturing an additional 768 net new airplane orders valued at $57 billion, we held our record unit backlog at nearly 5,800 airplanes worth some $432 billion; that’s approximately seven years of production at current rates. Full-year operating margins were 7.8 percent.
Our market leadership in twin-aisle airplane programs was punctuated in 2015 with deliveries of an industry- record 135 787s from our production centers in Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina. At the end of February, cumulative 787 deliveries totaled 380 airplanes to 43 customers. Market demand for the 787 is extensive and broad based as its game-changing capabilities continue to improve the way the world flies. For example, thanks to the 787’s unprecedented combination of range and fuel efficiency, airlines flying it soon will operate more than 90 new nonstop routes between cities that previously haven’t had nonstop service.
Demand also remains strong for our next new twin- aisle airplane, the 777X, which has a backlog of 306 orders from six customers and is on track for first delivery in 2020. Ensuring a smooth production transition between today’s 777 and the 777X is a top priority. Our confidence in efficiently bridging between the two models is high, given our backlog of more than 200 current-model 777s, ongoing market demand and a strong value proposition for
customers. In addition, in 2015, we began introducing fastener automation technology on the 777 program to reduce cost and flow time in assembly. We are maturing this technology on the current production line before transitioning it to the 777X.
In the highly competitive single-aisle market, the
737 family reached 588 net new orders and 495 deliveries in 2015, with a total program backlog at year-end of nearly 4,400 airplanes. The first 737 MAX test airplane rolled out of the factory on schedule in December 2015 and in January 2016 began its flight test program with a successful first flight. The highly fuel-efficient new 737 MAX has won nearly 3,100 orders since launch from a diverse set of the world’s best airlines. We are on track to deliver the first
737 MAX, to Southwest Airlines, in the third quarter of 2017.
The outlook for our commercial airplane business remains positive as favorable passenger traffic trends and airline profitability forecasts continue to drive healthy global demand for new airplanes. To meet this demand, profitably build out our backlog and absorb new orders, our commercial airplane output will grow by approximately 30 percent over the next five years based on previously announced produc- tion rate increases. The 737 rate will rise from 42 per month today to 47 per month in 2017, followed by
52 per month in 2018 and 57 per month in 2019. The 787 will increase to 12 per month in mid-2016 and
14 per month later this decade. Boosted by a 2015 order from FedEx Express for 50 freighters, the 767 program will increase production to two per month in 2016 and 2.5 per month in late 2017.
Overall, the commercial airplane market represents a substantial growth opportunity, with a combination of fleet expansions and replacement demand expected to drive the need for more than 38,000 airplanes world- wide over the next 20 years. This ongoing demand, coupled with our record unit backlog, reinforces our production rate plans and positions us for significant revenue, earnings and cash growth in the years ahead.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security had another strong year in 2015—with solid revenue, healthy margins and progress on numerous key milestones. Revenues totaled $30.4 billion, and operating margins grew to 10.8 percent. We delivered 186 air- craft, along with 15,787 weapons systems and four satellites. New orders reached $27 billion, resulting in a solid year-end backlog of $58 billion. International customers represented roughly one-third of revenue and 40 percent of current backlog.

 2015 defense-related milestones included
The first flight of the KC-46A tanker and its first international sale to Japan;
The first EA-18G rollout to the Royal Australian Air Force;
The fourth and final AEW&C delivery to Turkey;
Completion of the final C-17 after a successful 20-year production run; and
The selection of the 747-8 to replace the current U.S. presidential aircraft.
We also added to our leadership in space with
A successful flight software demonstration on the CST-100 spacecraft;
A five-year contract extension to provide engineer- ing support services, resources and personnel for International Space Station operations;
NASA’s completion of the critical design review of the Space Launch System, including the Boeing- built core rocket stage and avionics system; and
12 successful launches in 2015 by our United Launch Alliance joint venture, extending our streak to more than 100 launches.
Overall, the strength of our defense and space business stems from our solid portfolio of products and services; disciplined investments in innovation; leveraging enterprise capabilities and technologies for future programs such as the T-X trainer, JSTARS recapitalization and numerous unmanned systems; and driving new levels of affordability and productiv- ity through our ongoing market-based affordability and Partnering for Success efforts. With this in mind, and with early signs of an improving U.S. defense budget environment, we remain confident about
our prospects for continued success in the global defense, space and security market worth $3 trillion over the next decade.
ONE BOEING
Many 2015 achievements harnessed the unique power and potential of “One Boeing,” including
the successful first flight of the KC-46A tanker, reaching key production and delivery milestones on the 787 program, winning reauthorization of the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and making important growth investments in our people, products and
services. Continued progress on enterprisewide efforts, including quality, productivity and workplace safety, are strengthening our competitiveness in the marketplace and driving lasting improvements across the company.
Strategic growth and diversification of our manufactur- ing and engineering footprint are further enhancing our capabilities and capacities, improving business continuity and productivity, and increasing our access to new talent and technology. In 2015, $700 million of new construction and building expansions totaling 3.9 million square feet provided additional capability for increased production rates and new programs, including 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX. Boeing South Carolina strengthened airplane design and perfor- mance with a new propulsion system facility, and
we opened 13 new engineering career-development centers across the globe to ensure we have the best team and talent to support our continued leadership in innovation.
OUR NEXT 100 YEARS
After a decade of restoration and renewal and con- tinued momentum gains in 2015, Boeing is stronger, healthier and more competitive than ever.
But no matter how well we’re doing or how far we’ve come, we know our future in this “more for less” world is not guaranteed and the standards and goals we set for ourselves must be bold. Attractive, grow- ing markets such as ours draw increasingly capable new competitors and inspire existing challengers to do better. Global economic and geopolitical tides are changing constantly, and our customers consistently demand more value for less money. And when it comes to talent, influence and capital, we compete with the world’s best global companies. In short, success going forward will require the very best
from our team and ever-higher levels of business performance throughout the company.
With our storied past as inspiration for the future, our mission is to be the world’s aerospace leader and
an enduring global industrial champion—with world- class performance in all dimensions. To achieve these goals in our second century, we are centering our efforts on two overarching strategies; first, to continue building strength-on-strength to deliver on our existing plans and commitments, and improve them where needed. And, second, to stretch our- selves beyond those plans to sharpen and accelerate our pace of progress on key growth and productivity efforts to achieve our full potential.

 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
Our backlog remains strong at
$489 billion with net orders of
$83 billion for 2015, as we continued to focus on productivity and posi- tioning Boeing to deliver sustained growth and strong business performance for years to come.
We delivered a record 762 commer- cial airplanes and grew our services business while continuing to improve productivity and quality, prepare the production system for the transition to new models, and adjust rates.
Increased production rates, supe- rior new commercial airplanes and continued innovation will help keep Boeing competitive across address- able markets, valued at $3.7 trillion over the next 10 years.
With proven products and services and a commitment to improved productivity and affordability, Boeing remains well positioned in global defense, space and security markets worth $3.0 trillion over the next decade.
FINANCIAL RESULTS
Revenues in 2015 rose 6 percent to a record $96.1 billion driven by record commercial deliveries and solid performance in our defense, space and security business.
Core earnings per share reflected charges for the KC-46A tanker and 747 programs, which were partially offset by strong core operating performance across the company.
In 2015, our operating cash flow continued to grow, supporting a
20 percent increase in our dividend and a new share repurchase authorization of $14 billion.

Both strategies will require a clear and consistent focus across the enterprise on the following priorities to
Profitably ramp up commercial airplane production;
Continue to strengthen our defense and space business;
Deliver on our development programs;
Drive world-class levels of productivity and performance to fund our investments in innova- tion and growth; and
Attract, develop and retain the best team and talent in the industry.
To accelerate the company’s growth strategy over the next decade, we also are honing our focus to
Advance our design and manufacturing capabilities to reduce development time and improve customer responsiveness;
Grow our services business in commercial aviation and defense;
Achieve step-function improvements in safety, quality and productivity; and
Grow globally to capture new capabilities and efficiencies and increased market share.
With clear strategies and strong market positions,
a large and diverse order backlog worth nearly
half a trillion dollars, and increasing production rates, we are well positioned for sustained profitable growth and higher cash flow to fund future innova- tion and provide increasing value to our customers, shareholders, employees and other partners.
THE ENVIRONMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES
While we focus on building a bigger, better Boeing, we also never lose sight of opportunities to build
a better planet. Once again last year, through
their actions and generosity, the people of Boeing demonstrated a deep and enduring commitment to improving the environment and our communities.
In 2015, Boeing completed the largest single resto- ration project on the Duwamish River in Washington state; the 757 ecoDemonstrator tested more than
15 technologies aimed at improved environmental performance, including the first flight with U.S.-made “green diesel” fuel; and we announced several col- laborations with universities and other organizations to advance research of sustainable aviation products and practices. At our facilities, despite record-level aircraft production, we continue to target zero
growth by 2017 in greenhouse gas emissions, water intake, hazardous waste (normalized to revenue) and solid waste sent to landfills.
Boeing—and our employees and retirees—also invested $190 million in 2015 to help improve lives and build better communities worldwide. During our global month of service, for example, employees and their family members and friends participated in more than 200 projects benefiting community partners in 14 countries, and science-, technology-, engineering- and math-focused giving and volunteering are helping to prepare and inspire
the next generation of innovators.
A BOLD, CHALLENGING AND INSPIRING FUTURE
I would be remiss without extending a special thank you to Jim McNerney, our retired chairman, president and CEO, for his decade of leadership at Boeing. During his tenure, we reinvigorated our business per- formance and strategies, renewed our commitment to foundational values, focused on customer-inspired innovation funded by continuous productivity improvement and made leadership development a top priority. His contributions will be lasting, and our gratitude enduring.
After nine months as CEO, and 30 years with Boeing, I am humbled and energized by the opportunity to lead this iconic company and this exceptional team. We have a big year ahead of us and a bold, challeng- ing and inspiring vision for our future. We also have
a company and history like no other—one whose products and services positively affect hundreds
of millions of people around the world every day. Simply put: The work we do matters—to commercial airplane passengers, men and women in uniform, astronauts pushing the boundaries of space, and future generations of innovators, explorers and dreamers—and so we must do it forever and always with the utmost integrity and excellence.
Every Boeing employee is a steward of our incredible aerospace legacy, and I can think of no better team to entrust with this great privilege and responsibility. Together, we will build an even bigger, better Boeing in our second century for the benefit of our customers, our shareholders, our partners and one another.
