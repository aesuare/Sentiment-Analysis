 To Our Stockholders
Our ongoing focus on bargains delivered another year of record results for Ross Stores in 2010. This better-than- expected financial performance is even more noteworthy considering it was on top of outstanding sales and earnings gains in 2009.
2010 EPS Up 31% on Top of a 52% Gain in 2009
For the 52 weeks ended January 29, 2011, sales increased 9% to a record $7.9 billion, with same store sales up 5% on top of a 6% gain in the prior year. Home, Dresses, and Shoes were our top performing merchandise categories in 2010, with the Florida market posting the largest same store sales gain.
Net earnings for the year grew 25% to a record $554.8 million, up from $442.8 million in 2009. Earnings per share rose to $4.63, compared to $3.54 in the prior year. This represented an exceptional gain of 31% on top of a 52% increase in 2009. Operating margin in 2010 grew to a record 11.5%, up 140 basis points on top of a 250 basis point gain in 2009. The main drivers of this significant improvement in profitability were higher gross margin and increased leverage on operating expenses from the healthy gain in same store sales.
Strong Inventory Management Continues
to Drive Higher Margins
As we ended 2010, average in-store inventories were down about 10% on top of double-digit declines in the prior two years. We believe opportunities exist to further reduce in- store inventories in 2011, with average store levels targeted to be down in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to 2010.
Operating our business on lower inventory levels has increased the percentage of fresh and exciting merchandise our customers see when they shop our stores. By exceeding our sales targets with leaner inventories, we also realized significantly faster turns in 2010, which resulted in lower markdowns as a percent of sales and another year of record merchandise gross margin.

The systems investments and new planning and allocation processes we rolled out in 2009 continue to help us do a better job of getting the right merchandise to the right store at the right time. This is an iterative process that should enable us to build on our successes and continue to enhance sales productivity and profitability going forward. We believe that planning and allocating at a much more detailed level is more important than ever, especially with less inventory in our stores.
Expansion Accelerates at dd’s DISCOUNTS
During 2010, dd’s DISCOUNTS store growth accelerated as we added 15 locations and entered two new states — Nevada and Georgia. In addition, comparable stores at dd’s DISCOUNTS posted respectable sales gains on top of exceedingly strong increases in 2009. Like Ross, dd’s DISCOUNTS has benefited from our ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to our stores, while operating on lower inventory levels. As a result, merchandise gross margin in 2010 grew significantly on top of record levels in 2009.

  We are pleased to report that the progress made at dd’s DISCOUNTS over the past few years enabled this young business to make a slight contribution to total pre-tax earnings in 2010 before corporate expense allocations. These results compare to a relatively neutral impact in 2009 and a 35 basis point drag in 2008.
We believe dd’s DISCOUNTS’ improved performance reflects that its value-focused merchandise offerings continue to resonate well with its target customers.
Store Growth to Increase in 2011 with Entry
into New Markets
As planned, we added 50 net new stores in 2010, consisting of 35 Ross Dress for Less and as mentioned, 15 dd’s DISCOUNTS locations, and ended the year with 1,055 locations in 27 states and Guam.
We remain on track to increase unit growth to an annual rate of 7% in 2011, with plans to open about 80 additional locations during the year. This store growth will be comprised of approximately 60 Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. In addition, about 15 of the 60 new Ross stores are targeted to open during the latter part of the year in new markets in Illinois and Arkansas.
We are excited about our opportunities for continued growth. We believe that Ross Dress for Less ultimately can have at least 1,500 locations and dd’s DISCOUNTS can grow to about 500 stores. This gives us a total long-term potential of more than 2,000 locations, which is approximately double our current store base.
Healthy Cash Flows Continued to Self-Fund Growth
Operating cash flows in 2010 continued to provide the necessary resources to fund new store growth and infrastructure improvements. We invested $199 million of capital during the year, including approximately $136 million to open new locations and renovate existing stores and about $63 million, primarily for distribution infrastructure and information technology projects. We ended 2010 with $837 million in cash and short-term investments and $150 million in long-term debt.
For fiscal 2011, capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately $380 million to $390 million in support of our plans for accelerated store growth as well as some long-term supply chain investments. Operating cash flows are projected to self-fund this higher spending level.
Increased Stock Repurchase and Dividend Programs
Over the past year, we continued to return cash to our stockholders through both our stock repurchase and dividend programs. In January 2010, our Board of Directors approved both a two-year, $750 million repurchase program and a 45% increase in the quarterly cash dividend. A total of $375 million of common stock, or about 6.7 million shares, were repurchased in 2010.
In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $900 million of common stock over the next two years through fiscal 2012, as well as a 38% increase in the quarterly cash dividend. This new and larger authorization replaced the $375 million remaining under the prior program.

    The recent increases to both our stock repurchase and dividend programs demonstrate our confidence in the Company’s ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of excess cash after self-funding the capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and raised our quarterly cash dividend annually since 1994. This consistent record of returning excess cash reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns.
Improved Business Model Enhances
Long-Term Profitability
We are extremely pleased with our exceptional sales and earnings increases and record returns over the past few years. Looking ahead, we believe that our steadfast focus on diligently executing our off-price strategies will enable us to continue delivering compelling bargains and solid results in 2011 and beyond.
Off-price buying is and always will be our most important business strategy. We remain committed to making ongoing investments in our merchandise organization to maximize our access to the best opportunities for product in the marketplace.
The biggest driver of our improved profitability has been much higher merchandise gross margin resulting from better buying, and the significant reductions we have made in average selling store inventories. Today, selling store inventories are more than 30% lower than just three years ago. Our record results have also benefited from the implementation of a number of initiatives on the operating side of our business. These include our shortage control program which has resulted in record low levels of shrink, along with the numerous productivity enhancements and efficiencies we have put in place throughout the Company to drive down costs in our distribution centers, stores organization, and back office functions.
As a result of these changes, we believe that our current levels of annual operating margin are sustainable going forward. This gives us the confidence to continue to target – over the longer term – average annual earnings per share growth of 10% to 15%. The formula for achieving this is a combination of unit growth, annual increases in same store sales, and ongoing reductions in diluted shares from our stock repurchase programs.
In closing, we extend our sincere appreciation to all of our customers, business partners, and stockholders for their continued support. We especially want to acknowledge and thank our almost 50,000 associates who remain the primary drivers of our past, present, and future success.
   Sincerely,
Michael Balmuth
Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
