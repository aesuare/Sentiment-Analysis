We use society’s waste as a renewable fuel that we tap to create energy. And by doing this we avoid dumping more waste into landfills where it will generate harmful greenhouse gases for years to come.
Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions
to Combat Global Warming
2007 was a year when climate change dominated public policy agendas around the globe.
The issue of climate change has shifted from a debate over its existence to a serious discussion among local, national, and global leaders on how to manage greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming. Some policies have been set, others are yet to be formulated, but it is clear that benefits will accrue to companies and technologies that can economically and effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Regulatory bodies in Europe have concluded that better waste disposal can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and they have determined that Energy-from-Waste is a superior alternative to landfilling. In China, we expect to generate carbon credits from converting municipal solid waste into clean, renewable energy because of the favorable greenhouse gas reductions from

 using EfW. On a local level, in the United States and abroad, municipal and business leaders who are feeling the pressure to reduce their carbon footprint are also coming to this realization.
By harnessing the energy of residual waste, we reduce greenhouse gas emissions created by landfills and cut our dependence on fossil fuels. Using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) municipal solid waste life-cycle model to calculate the benefit, Covanta’s facilities already prevent the release of approx- imately 15 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year.
Waste buried in a landfill is just that–a waste. And we estimate that if the United States reduced landfilling by 65% and converted that waste into energy it would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 150 million tons per year and provide over 2% of the nation’s electricity.
Generating Clean Energy
from Renewable Fuels
Last year, escalating energy costs were driven by increased de- mand and higher prices for fossil fuels worldwide. This growing demand is not expected to ease any time soon–global electricity consumption is predicted to increase by 50% in the next 30 years, driven by population growth and the improving standard of living in developing nations.
Our facilities are equipped with advanced technologies.
  By producing energy from waste, Covanta offsets the generation of 15 million tons of greenhouse gases.

 Market forces are likely to cause pricing volatility in the near term, but long-term supply and demand fundamentals, coupled with the need to reduce carbon emissions, point toward a sus- tained trend of higher energy prices.
While everyone agrees we need to increase efficiency to reduce future demand, it is clear that the world needs to do much more than that. We must also aggressively pursue alternative energy sources and develop new technologies to reduce or sequester emissions from existing energy sources.
The world’s challenge is how to implement such sweeping changes quickly and still provide affordable, clean energy with- out stifling economic growth.
As the leader in Energy-from-Waste, Covanta is positioned to help meet this challenge by creating renewable energy. Twenty- four hours a day, seven days a week, our facilities make enough electricity to power more than a million homes.
This contribution has not been overlooked. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005, 23 states, and the U.S. Department of Energy have defined EfW as a “renewable technology.” The Energy Department has also noted that converting garbage into energy makes “important contributions to the overall effort to achieve

increased renewable energy use.” The U.S. EPA now states that modern EfW facilities produce power “with less environmental impact than almost any other source of electricity.”
Adopting Environmentally Sustainable Waste Disposal Practices
Central to our role in providing renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions is our ability to provide the best sustain- able option for residual waste disposal.
After comprehensive recycling, community leaders face two proven choices in dealing with the residual waste that remains– they can bury it in a landfill or convert it into energy at a modern EfW facility.
Up to now, the most common choice has been to landfill that waste–but this is simply not a sustainable choice. In addition to emitting the potent greenhouse gas methane, landfills also consume valuable land and create the potential for groundwater contamination. Despite these significant drawbacks, approxi- mately one billion tons of waste is landfilled each year. The United States alone buries 250 million tons of waste annually.

 Why? The reason is simple. Historically, it cost less to landfill when long-term environmental costs were not considered. Many communities found it more expedient to put trash disposal out of sight and out of mind, often transporting their garbage hundreds of miles before having it dumped in a landfill.
A growing number of countries, however, are rethinking this strategy of “buried and best forgotten.” Instead, they are con- sidering the environmental consequences of landfilling and seeking a sustainable long-term solution to their waste disposal needs. Already, the European Union is requiring a 65% reduc- tion in landfilling of biodegradable municipal solid waste by 2020. Similar efforts are underway in China where the central government has mandated converting 30% of its municipal sol- id waste into energy by 2030. In North America, environmental considerations and higher energy prices are prompting several communities to consider new EfW facilities. We believe this trend will continue to gain momentum.
Twenty-two of Covanta’s facilities have been accepted into an OSHA program for exemplary occupational safety and health standards.
We employ the world’s leading exper ts in the Energy-from-Waste industry.

2007–Progress on Growth Initiatives and Steady Operations
We achieved our immediate operational and financial goals in 2007, while continuing to execute our strategy and strengthen our competitive position for the road ahead. Here are a few of the highlights.
Achieved Operational Excellence
The day-to-day operations of our facilities continued to draw accolades. Twenty-three of our facilities have been accepted into the U.S. EPA National Environmental Performance Track program for exemplary environmental performance. Twenty- two of our facilities have earned the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program STAR safety award. This puts Covanta among the top 10 organizations in the nation, of any size, in garnering these awards, and is evidence of our continuing commitment to safety and environmental performance.
Strong and Predictable Financial Results
2007 was a very good year for Covanta. Operating revenues grew 13% to $1.4 billion. We met or exceeded our guidance for all key financial metrics. Our highly contracted revenue coupled with our consistent operating performance drove these predictable results–something to be coveted during uncertain economic con- ditions. In particular, we were pleased with our cash flow from

 operations, which exceeded $358 million. We reinvested nearly all this cash in the business: $55 million was spent on capital expenditures to maintain existing facilities, $164 million was used to pay down project debt, and $134 million was deployed for acquisitions, equity investments, and other projects to grow the business. To fuel our future growth, we will continue to focus on generating strong and predictable cash flow.
Strengthened and Simplified
Our Capital Structure
We completed a recapitalization of the company’s balance sheet in February 2007, eliminating layers of debt, reducing annual interest expense by $42 million, and significantly increasing our flexibility to pursue growth. Now we have the financial capacity to execute our strategy from a position of strength.
Marked Progress in All Strategic
Growth Initiatives
United States–We increased our domestic renewable electricity capacity by 10%, and our EfW capacity by nearly 5%. We acquired two EfW facilities in Massachusetts, signed a 10-year operating contract in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and signed a 25-year exten- sion of our contract with Hempstead, New York. In 2007, we also completed our expansion of the Lee County, Florida facility, and developed our Northeast waste disposal network by acquiring five
Our facilities process more than 15 million tons of municipal solid waste each year.

 strategically located transfer stations with a total capacity of 3,000 tons per day. And we acquired two biomass-fired power plants located in California.
Europe–We are focusing on prospects in the United Kingdom and Ireland where we anticipate 10 million tons per year of new mu- nicipally sponsored EfW capacity will be installed by 2020. Progress this year was marked by entering agreements for the development, construction, and operation of a 600,000 metric ton-per-year EfW project serving the City of Dublin, Ireland and surrounding communities. This will be a flagship facility for us as we work to establish a strong Covanta presence in the European market. To capitalize on the opportunities in the United Kingdom, we have assembled an excellent team that is working hard to secure contracts on several municipal tenders. This promises to be a competitive and exciting marketplace.
China–In the next decade, we anticipate 40 to 50 million tons per year of new EfW capacity will be installed in China. To position Covanta in this important market, we have moved forward with two important joint ventures during 2007. First, we purchased a 40% stake in Sanfeng Covanta Environmental Industry Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of Chongqing Iron & Steel, China’s fourth- largest steel company. Sanfeng designed, built, and has minor- ity ownership interests in two modern 1,200 ton-per-day EfW

                  facilities in China. We believe Sanfeng’s local design, fabrication construction, and technical expertise gives us a competitive advan- tage as we pursue additional EfW opportunities.
We also formed a new joint venture to develop, own, and operate EfW facilities in Guangdong Province in southeast China, which we see as a key region in China for EfW and renewable energy development. Our partner, Guangzhou Development Industry Holdings Co., Ltd. (GDIH), is one of the largest power compa- nies in this fast-growing region and has extensive experience in the development and operation of electric power facilities.
New Technology–Covanta continues to champion next gen- eration, clean EfW technologies aimed at further advancing our environmental performance and growing our business.
In 2007, we announced the development and successful test- ing of two new and cost-effective technologies–LN and VLN. The LN technology is designed for use on existing facilities. When utilized in conjunction with the control systems already employed, nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are cut to approxi- mately half of current regulatory limits. The VLN technology sets the standard for new EfW facilities with similarly dramatic NOx reductions while increasing energy efficiency to give us an additional competitive advantage.
More than 3,000 employees work at Covanta facilities located throughout the world.
