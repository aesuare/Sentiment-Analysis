PRODUCTS AND PROGRESS

A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN

Two years ago Ford Motor Company began a determined journey toward renewed competitiveness and profitability. We drew important lessons from our past, focused on our core automotive and automotive finance businesses, and set out to build our future. In 2002 we made solid progress and began moving in the right direction. Last year the progress continued with a growing number of successes and the start of a massive wave of new products. Our 2003 accomplishments include:

Agreements with the United Auto Workers and Visteon Corporation that allow greater operating flexibility. Improved operating results in South America and Asia-Pacific. A return to profitability at our Premier Automotive Group. A record pre-tax profit of $3 billion at Ford Credit. A strong automotive cash position of $25.9 billion.

Full-year net income of $495 million, or 27 cents per share, compared to a net loss of 55 cents per share in 2002. Excluding special items, full-year income from continuing operations more than doubled to $1.14 per share.* An improved business structure, including capacity reductions that made us more efficient and aligned to the market. Cost reductions of $3.2 billion.** A year-over-year increase in per unit revenue in North America of $724, which helped it achieve pre-tax profits of $1.8 billion, excluding special items.* Numerous successful vehicle launches, including Ford Focus C-MAX in Europe; Jaguar XJ and Volvo S40 worldwide; and Ford F-150, Ford Freestar and Mercury Monterey in North America. The biggest quality improvement of any of the five major automakers, with recall volumes reduced dramatically and warranty spending down 18 percent from 2002. We're not where we want to be yet, but in the last two years our quality has improved by more than 16 percent.

Since our efforts began we have consistently delivered on our financial commitments. We exceeded earnings estimates in every quarter of the past two years and our profit targets for 2002 and 2003. Excluding special items, our overall financial results have improved by about $5 billion in two years, which is ahead of plan. In 2003 we were disappointed with our business results in Europe and our market share in North America. There continued to be overcapacity worldwide among all manufacturers and, as a result, incentives remained high. But overall we dramatically improved our profitability and moved closer to achieving our mid-decade goals. By continuing to focus on improving our core businesses and leveraging Ford's unique strengths, we intend to grow our business profitably over time. Our plans begin with great products, which have always been the foundation of success in our business. This year we are introducing 40 new products worldwide. By mid-decade we will have launched more than 150 new products, by far the most of any similar time period in our history.

* Special items totaling $2.1 billion on a pre-tax basis were primarily related to restructuring charges at Ford Europe ($513 million) and charges at Ford North America resulting
from our agreement with Visteon ($1.6 billion).

** At constant volume, mix and currency exchange rates; excluding special items.

We are calling 2004 the "Year of the Car" because most of the new products we are introducing in North America this year are cars. That includes the 2005 Ford Focus, Five Hundred, Freestyle, GT and Mustang, as well as the Mercury Montego. Adding these new cars to our best-selling lineup of sport utility vehicles and trucks will give us a strong and balanced competitive lineup in our most important market. Great products by themselves are not enough to ensure success in today's fiercely competitive automotive market. A business structure and processes that maximize operational quality and efficiency are essential. From the beginning our plans have focused on making fundamental and far-reaching improvements in these areas. As with our new products, we have begun to see solid results from our efforts. Consumer Driven 6-Sigma, our quality improvement and waste elimination methodology, has had an increasingly dramatic impact on our operations.

Since its inception we've completed more than 9,500 projects that have saved us $1.7 billion worldwide, including $731 million in 2003. In addition, we attribute about half of our currentmodel quality improvement to Consumer Driven 6-Sigma projects. Team Value Management (TVM), a process that brings together cross-functional teams to improve value and quality, was implemented in North America and across all our business units during 2003. Working collaboratively with our supply base, we assessed the gaps between actual and industry benchmark costs and, with supplier support, achieved record total material cost reductions. The transformation of our assembly plants into lean and flexible centers of manufacturing excellence also is gaining momentum. Our new next-generation flexible manufacturing system standardizes operations, allows multiple models to be built on the same assembly line and enables

faster product changeovers. Three more plants in the United States will begin using the new system this year. By the end of the decade all of our European and 75 percent of our North American assembly plants will have flexible systems in place. A key enabler for flexible manufacturing is having common vehicle architectures, so we also are planning a 25 percent reduction in the number of architectures we use by the end of the decade. The end result will be improved quality, faster speed to market and billions of dollars in cost reductions. The savings in time and resources also will allow us to offer more new models overall. As we continue to improve our operational excellence, we also are beginning to more fully leverage our unique strengths. I believe our dealer body in North America is the best in the industry. By working more closely as partners and providing them with many outstanding new cars and trucks to sell we are maximizing their effectiveness. Ford Credit, the best credit company in the world, is another competitive advantage for us. A consistent winner of the top J.D. Power awards for customer satisfaction, it is now concentrating efforts on supporting our automotive business. The loyalty that people have to our company is another asset we want to fully leverage. In the latest R. L. Polk consumer loyalty study of new vehicles in North America we won 10 of 16 possible awards, including the Highest Overall Loyalty to Make award, which went to Ford Division. Last year's centennial celebration dramatically demonstrated the strong emotional ties that have helped us build this large and loyal customer base. More than 225,000 people came to our headquarters to join our extended family in marking this historic milestone. For those and millions of other Ford fans around the world our heritage and family connections create a special

bond. As we improve our business operations, we also plan to build on those family feelings and distinguish ourselves as a different kind of company. Being a family company, and not a faceless corporation, creates high expectations. We must deliver distinct products that offer quality, safety and value. We must treat our customers with honesty and respect. We have to be good neighbors in the communities where we do business. And I strongly believe we also must be outstanding citizens of the world, taking leadership on social and environmental issues related to the automotive industry. An area that will be critical to the success of these efforts is the environmental performance of our products. Later this year we will introduce Ford Escape Hybrid, a mainstream SUV with a full hybrid-electric powertrain. Escape Hybrid is designed to be the cleanest and most fuel-efficient SUV in the world. It is expected to achieve more than 35 miles per gallon in city driving, by far the best for any SUV, without compromising versatility or performance. We also will begin selling a fuel cell-powered version of the Ford Focus to commercial fleets later this year. These products are part of an overall commitment to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse

gases and other emissions across our entire range of vehicles. Addressing air pollution and climate change issues effectively and transparently is a key element of our product development plans. Looking ahead, we expect to have continued improvement in our business operations around the world in 2004.

Our North American operations will benefit from an improving economy and the many new products we will introduce in the fall. We anticipate improvements in the overall market in South America, and an increase in our market share. In Asia, we project that our profits and share will improve with the help of major new investments in the region. We anticipate a dramatic improvement in Europe in 2004, due to business restructuring and new products. Our Premier Automotive Group will introduce 14 new or revised models in 2004, and benefit from greater discipline in the execution of our premium brand strategy and resource sharing.

America and Europe, will account for 65 percent of worldwide automotive revenue growth as customers move up to vehicles with higher prices and larger margins. Ford Motor Company is already the leading seller of luxury vehicles in North America. As increasingly prosperous consumers seek more features, functionality and luxury, we will be ready for them with an exceptional selection of premium vehicles. There are still many challenges ahead of us as we begin our next 100 years. Competition in the automotive industry is intensifying, with more market segments and more new products than ever before. At the same time, new technology is driving rapid change in products and processes. And leadership in operational excellence is a moving target as companies continue to improve in all areas. But we have many advantages to build on as we face these challenges: the strongest portfolio of brands in the world; an exceptional heritage that has given us a special connection to our customers; an experienced and stable management team; and a dedicated and talented extended family of employees, suppliers and dealers. We are uniquely positioned to do great things and become an even greater company. Our goal is to be the best automotive company in the world. Thank you for your support of our efforts.

Longer term, I believe our outlook is excellent if we continue to focus on operational excellence and concern for our customers and their world. Emerging markets, led by Asian countries, will experience 90 percent of the growth in automotive sales volumes in the next 10 years. I visited our Asia-Pacific operations last October and came away more impressed than ever by the potential for major growth there. We have plans in place to be much more aggressive in driving that growth, including expansions of our manufacturing capacity in China, Thailand and the Philippines that will strengthen our presence throughout the region. In the so-called "mature" markets dramatic growth will not be found in sales volumes, but in revenue. In the next 10 years these markets, primarily North
