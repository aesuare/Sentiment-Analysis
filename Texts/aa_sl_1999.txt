  To Alcoa Shareholders: continued from cover
 Alain Belda, President and Chief Executive Officer (right) with Paul O’Neill, Chairman of the Board
Revenues rose to a new high of $16.3 billion, and earnings exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history. Earnings per share increased by 17% to $2.82. The annual rate of return for Alcoa shareholders has averaged 33% over the past five years.
These are extraordinary results not only for Alcoa and
for this year but for most industrial companies and for any aluminum company, ever. Still, it’s important to realize: Our 1999 performance is a milestone, not a destination. It simply represents where we are now and holds some indication of what we can do and where we can go.
Looking back, these results are the fruits of determined, highly focused efforts over a period of years by a great
many Alcoa people, led by a management team committed to a high level of performance measured in profitable growth and in living our values. Looking ahead, we can survey
the global challenges before us from a raised platform – a larger, more versatile operating base capable of integrating

systems, services, and technologies across all business unit lines and national boundaries.
Our strategies are based on the premise that profitable growth is the indispensable fuel for sustained business success, and that such growth begins with customers who share our objectives and to whom we can provide a whole- solution resource.
As we integrate the key acquisitions made over the
past few years and extend our reach globally, it is clear that Alcoa has now established a base for profitable growth on a global scale. In keeping with our new view of the company and its global position, in 1999 we changed our name from Aluminum Company of America to Alcoa Inc.
1999 Acquisitions
Our major acquisition news in 1999 was the announcement of an agreement to acquire Reynolds Metals. This will add almost $5 billion in revenues, 100 facilities in 24 countries, and 19,000 new Alcoans to our family. Also in 1999, we
continued the integration of two significant acquisitions from 1998: Inespal in Spain, and Alumax, which together added $4 billion to our revenues and brought 19,000 people, a refinery, eight smelters, six rolling mills, and 15 extrusion plants into the Alcoa system. These new Alcoans and facilities have significantly contributed to our performance in 1999. Best-practice sharing of technology and operating methods has enriched both the old and the new Alcoa.
Not all of our growth activities in 1999 were on so
large a scale. In April we acquired the Castelsarrasin facility from Pechiney. This is a specialized bright rolling mill in France. We also acquired the Irurzun extrusion plant in Spain from Reynolds. In July we purchased the other 50% of A-CMI, a joint venture with Hayes Lemmerz that produces cast automotive structural parts in the U.S. and Norway. In October we acquired the San Antonio, Texas rolling operations of ACX, a Coors facility, to support Alcoa

the Excel extrusion facility in Warren, Ohio from Noranda Aluminum, to strengthen our extrusion construction products group. Finally, we initiated discussions with several different companies in Asia with an eye to accelerating
our growth in that region. Greater Alcoa participation in
Asia is a key goal in 2000.
In July we completed the expansion of the Wagerup, Australia refinery – on time and on budget – adding 440,000 metric tons per year to our world alumina system.
Growth, Integration and Learning
This ongoing stream of acquisitions and their subsequent performance have demonstrated that we now have
a globally transportable management system, capable
of integrating new operations swiftly, almost seamlessly, and of implementing our vision, values, and business system wherever we grow.
They have also underscored the fact that we have the humility to learn from talented people and successful technologies within these acquired operations – to absorb new ideas, new ways of doing things and of going to market.
We are keenly aware of the potential leverage inherent
in taking the best of this acquired talent and knowledge and applying it across the entire network of Alcoa’s operations. This is something that our organizational systems are expressly designed to do.
The Alcoa Business System
Over the past few years, we have amassed considerable experience in taking a system integration approach to
the use of management tools, production process controls, quality systems, technology, and human resource development. We have synthesized this knowledge in what we call the Alcoa Business System (ABS) – a clear set
of profitable growth objectives, along with the means of deployment and of management to achieve them. Part of ABS is APS – the Alcoa Production System – a
disciplined methodology to eliminate waste and empower the tremendous talents of our people to raise productivity beyond what was once thought possible.
For the customer, APS is a system to provide exactly

  what is needed, when it’s needed, at the lowest cost – a key to making Alcoa the supplier of choice in almost any market. In 1999, we compiled our first full year of applying ABS
consistently across our global network and extending it
into the operations of recently acquired companies.
The results speak for themselves, including annualized cost reductions of $728 million – part of a $1.1 billion initiative that we will complete this year. This is a good beginning, but we can see a great deal of additional potential as the system continues to roll out.
Related to these efficiencies, we have been working
to align Alcoa’s technology development with our product and market priorities, allocating research resources to
the most significant short-term and long-term opportunities. These research and development efforts support ABS both today and tomorrow – eventually playing a role in reinventing the aluminum industry by improving many of its basic processes. The bottom line objective is new and expanded applications for aluminum.

Core Values
Hand in hand with these developments, Alcoa continues
a vigorous program of support for its core values – which we believe are inseparable from the financial, commercial, manufacturing, and technology components of long-term success. In considering and implementing the acquisitions discussed earlier, we have made health, safety, and environmental issues an essential part of our due diligence process. Our confidence in our managers and management systems stems partly from the fact that they have been thoroughly tested in reaching progressively higher standards of protecting the health and safety of our people and the well- being of the environments within which we live and work.

As to safety specifically, our lost workday (LWD) accident rate in 1998 had improved to one LWD per 292 employees. In 1999, it improved still further, to one in 456, even as
we added 20,000 Alcoans to the group as a result of acquisitions in Europe and the U.S. This translates to one accident in a million work hours – a remarkable achievement. Even one accident is one too many, but we can be very proud of the leadership and dedication of the Alcoa managers who pursue our ambitious safety goals day in, day out, year-round. Their goal is zero workplace injuries.
On the environmental front, we continue to operate benchmark mine rehabilitation programs in Brazil, Australia, Jamaica and the U.S., many of which have been internationally recognized. Beyond these programs, our employees have planted over 300,000 trees in the first two years of our
One Million Trees program. Alcoa sets the standards

reductions, and is making rapid strides in chlorine use reduction. Fifteen of our locations are now certified to the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System, and 50 more are working toward that goal.
This is all part of what it will take to be the supplier of choice, employer of choice, and partner of choice in all
of our key markets and operating locations around the world. Thanks to the creative energy and commitment of our people and the integration of our systems, that goal is now within reach.
