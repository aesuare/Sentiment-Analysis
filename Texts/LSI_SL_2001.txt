the acquisitions of LSI Lightron and LSI Adapt during fiscal 2001, and would have been off about 9% excluding these two new companies. Income from Continuing Operations of $10.6 million compares to $18.3 million last year, a drop of 42% year-to-year. Earnings per share from Continuing Operations of $1.01 were off a similar percentage from the $1.77 reported in fiscal 2000. Shareholders' Equity, one of the measures of financial strength, of $127.2 million was up 8% in fiscal 2001. The year was difficult to be sure; however, it was one in which your Company fared better than many competitors as we prepared for future opportunities. As a result of our strategic focus on acquisitions and product development, both lighting and graphics, we have created a unique company. Major investments have been made during the past two years in companies that will strengthen our opportunities in the major national retail segments of our economy. These companies have been selected with the same criteria that we developed twenty-five years ago: leadership in the marketplace with high-quality products and capabilities, and a high level of customer service. Two of these acquisitions were made in fiscal 2001: LSI Lightron in order to bring specification grade fluorescent lighting to the commercial / industrial lighting package, and LSI Adapt in order to add site engineering services, planning and project management to our one-stop-shop capabilities. Both companies are expected to contribute nicely to profits in the future. We are making continuing investments in a higher level of technical services and capabilities in the Image Center in order to support the growth of our companies as well as the needs of our customers. For six years the Image Center has been an important element of our customers' development programs, with interactive virtual prototype capabilities that have saved them both time and development cost. This is yet another way of demonstrating to our customers that LSI is

MATURITY
Sincerely,

truly a value-added partner. During fiscal 2001 we expanded our reach to markets that represent global opportunities. We recently announced a partnership with a company based in Australia that will serve both the Australian and New Zealand markets. This was not an acquisition, but rather a true marketing partnership with a company that has been appropriately named LSI Hamilton Lighting. We believe that this will be the beginning of bringing LSI's lighting systems to other markets on a global basis. Our opportunities are enhanced by the financial strength of LSI, the investments made in companies and capabilities, innovative product development, strong relationships with customers, and the abilities of our many good employees and sales representatives. Major image conversion programs for customers in the petroleum / convenience store market (lighting and graphics) and quick service restaurant market (menu board systems) began late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. These customers have indicated their intention that roll outs of their new image programs will be underway in fiscal 2002. We believe that LSI is well positioned to be a value-added partner and major contributor to these visual image conversion programs. I would like to thank our employees, sales representatives, suppliers, customers and shareholders for their continued support and understanding, especially in fiscal 2001, as challenged as it was by soft economic conditions. Our business strategies are working, our commitment remains focused, Company management is strong, the financial strength is the best ever and we are well positioned to deliver The Power of Image to our customers.

INVESTMENT IN PEOPLE YIELDS HIGH RETURNS
Relationships Are Our Most Valuable Asset
LSI knew from its earliest days that the success of the company would depend on its investment in relationships. The company's 25-year philosophy of forging strong partnerships with our suppliers, customers and employees is yielding high returns today. LSI has grown from five employees in 1976 to a workforce family of nearly 1,600 in fiscal 2001. Our growth and acquisitions through the years have developed people and brought rich new talent and depth of experience to our company. In addition, our ongoing commitment to be an industry leader continues to strengthen our partnerships -- both within the company and out in the marketplace. We have always understood that relationships are the foundation of our company, as well as our most valuable asset. In short, we are successful because of the people who make up LSI Industries. We have strong faith in the growth of the company and our investment in our partners. By continuing to follow strategies to work together more productively, our company can confidently look forward to continued success in the future.

his year marks the twenty-five year silver anniversary of LSI Industries. As a start-up business with five employees working in a very small facility, we created a philosophy of doing business and a vision of success that are still valid today. We believe that good people in strong working relationships forge effective partnerships that lead to win-win situations with three critical groups: Employees, Suppliers and Customers. Our vision twenty-five years ago was to develop and grow a company that specialized in outdoor lighting systems for small to medium size niche markets, the first of which was the petroleum / convenience store market. This was a fairly difficult market in 1976 following the gasoline shortages and embargo from the OPEC countries. Our strategy was to always operate differently than our competitors. This approach translated into delivering a high level of customer service, becoming a leader in product development and offering high-quality, energy-efficient lighting systems to our customers. An important milestone for LSI occurred in 1985 as we completed a successful Initial Public Offering and became listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol "LYTS." Access to the equity markets as a source of capital initially in 1985 and again in 1996 with a secondary offering has been critical to the growth and expansion of LSI. Shareholders who bought LSI stock in the IPO in 1985 at a split-adjusted price of $3.53 per share have experienced over a 600% increase in share value in the past sixteen years, and have received approximately $2.25 per share in cash dividend payments since 1988. Our vision expanded in 1988 as we launched the strategy of becoming a one-of-

a-kind company to combine lighting systems with graphics products and services. Target customers were large national retail companies that need to present a consistent, quality image that communicates brand identification and security to their customers. This combination of lighting and graphics creates image and value. Or as we say, "1 + 1 = 3." We believe that having the ability to provide both lighting and graphics products to national retail marketers has given LSI a true competitive advantage for managing our customers' re-imaging programs. Today, LSI is a recognized leader in providing some of the most exciting products in both the lighting and graphics industries. With our headquarters in Cincinnati, LSI has expanded throughout the country through acquisitions and now has sixteen manufacturing facilities and offices located in twelve states. These businesses provide related services and products for continued growth opportunities made available to LSI through strong relationships with, and service to, our customers. LSI is an established company that is in an ideal position to take advantage of the major consolidations occurring in the oil industry. Within the past three years, the largest mergers have been Shell/Texaco, BP/Amoco/Arco, and Exxon/Mobil. We believe the full merger and integration of these companies will take several years to complete, which could result in image or branding changes at a majority of the service station / convenience stores in North America, as well as some internationally. LSI is in excellent position to service these customers and benefit from these dynamic changes. Fiscal 2001 was a trying year due to soft economic conditions in North America and our business from the oil industry lagging even farther behind the economy as the major oil companies and their jobbers reorganize and regroup following the mergers. Net sales of $233.9 million were off about 3% from last year's net sales of $240.0 million. Revenues benefited from
