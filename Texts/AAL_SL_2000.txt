2000 was a year marked by much-improved financial performance and a number of strategic initiatives that position AMR well for success in the years to come. Excluding special items, the Company's net earnings for the year were $752 million ­ a result that compares favorably to 1999's net earnings of $543 million. Robust demand for air travel and for air cargo services, as well as product and service enhancements, prudent capacity growth and an effective fuel-hedging program all helped offset a very dramatic increase in the price of jet fuel. Producing superior financial returns is, of course, fundamental to our goal of making AMR a very rewarding investment for our shareholders. But 2000 was a unique year for our Company, as March brought the spin-off of our 83 percent stake in Sabre Holdings Corp. (Sabre). That transaction gave individual shareholders the equivalent of a one-time $34.96 per share dividend, which means that on the day the transaction took place, AMR shareholders benefited from a $5.2 billion transfer of market value. Creating industry-leading outcomes for our shareholders, customers and employees is the overarching goal of the Airline Leadership Plan, the strategic program we launched in 1999 that focuses the Company's activities on the six areas that we believe define success for any airline: Safety, Service, Product, Technology, Culture and Network. In 2000, we made important strides toward industry leadership in all six.

As has been the case throughout American's history, Safety is the foundation of everything we do. One of 2000's early highlights took place in January when our Aviation Safety Action Partnership (ASAP) program was lauded by President Clinton as a model to be implemented throughout the industry. Another important milestone was the creation of a new organization ­ reporting directly to the office of the Chairman ­ sharply focused on issues of safety, security and the environment. And within that framework, one of the very significant developments of 2000 was the reorganization of training in the Flight Department. We are investing more than $11 million annually to increase the frequency of recurrent pilot training. As we seek new ways to improve upon our already industry-leading safety programs, it's no secret that high load factors ­ combined with some unusual weather and an ongoing crisis in our nation's air traffic control system ­ put a serious strain on our industry's ability to deliver the reliable service our customers deserve and expect. While no carrier can remedy the inadequacies of the air traffic control system ­ nor can we do much about the weather ­ we have made some important structural changes that are improving our ability to deliver industry-leading Service.

In 2000, we completely overhauled the American Airlines and American Eagle schedules at our Chicago O'Hare and Dallas/Fort Worth connecting hubs. We also implemented a series of programs throughout our Maintenance and Engineering organization designed to increase the dependability of our fleet. These and other efforts have borne fruit, and while we ­ along with the rest of the industry ­ remain somewhat at the mercy of air traffic control, we are determined to preserve American's reputation for service leadership by running the best, most reliable operation possible. In the third area of airline leadership, Product, we made tremendous progress in 2000. We put 43 new jet aircraft into service at American and introduced 29 new regional jets at American Eagle. More dramatically, we seized industry leadership in onboard comfort with the launch and implementation of our More Room Throughout Coach program, which is enhancing the comfort, satisfaction, loyalty and disposition of virtually every American Airlines coach customer. We have also increased legroom in Business Class and introduced two major enhancements to our premium cabin ­ the 767 fully flat seat, and the new Flagship Suite Concept on our 777 aircraft serving Europe and Latin America.

In addition to our aircraft-related product enhancements, we also improved our onboard entertainment options, continued to refresh and improve our physical infrastructure at airports all over the world, and began a partnership with America Online to create AOL/AAdvantage miles, which gives AAdvantage members a wealth of new opportunities to earn and redeem miles, online and off. The AOL/AAdvantage program is a good example of how new technology is changing virtually every part of our business ­ and why technology leadership is a critically important element of our over-all strategy. In 2000, we made important strides to better leverage the changes taking place in technology to produce positive results for our shareholders, customers and employees. At airports and reservations centers through-out the American Airlines system, we are in the throes of major re-engineering projects designed to give our people better, easier-to-use tools that will enable them to provide even better customer service. From a marketing perspective, the Internet revolution is creating enormous opportunities for American. In 2000, our Web site, AA.com, was hailed by CIO magazine as one of the top 50 business Internet sites. No other airline site made the list. Kudos are nice, but what's even nicer is the ability AA.com has given us to leverage the strength of AAdvantage and offer our best customers a wide range of individualized promotions. While the business of travel distribution continues to evolve very quickly ­ with new online channels emerging on what seems like a daily basis ­ American is also exploring ways to exploit the connective power of the Internet to reduce procurement costs.

In fact, we are collaborating with several other carriers to create a new business-to-business site that we think will streamline, and wring significant expense and investment from, our supply chain. Technology leadership has been a hallmark of American's strategy for decades. Sustaining that leadership in an environment as fast changing as today's is tougher than ever. That's a big reason why we launched the on-time on-line home computer program in 2000. This program, which provides our people with discounted home computers and Internet access, is an acknowledgement that we are taking the technology challenge very seriously and that we will need the partic-ipation of the entire American team if we are going to meet it. Technology is obviously an area of our business that has changed dramatically in recent years. But one part of our management challenge that hasn't changed is the imperative to consider the interests of our employees in every decision we make. Culture leadership is a strategic imperative every bit as important as the other five areas of the Airline Leadership Plan, and in 2000 American launched a number of "people initiatives" with that in mind. These include the aforementioned on-time on-line program, enhancements to our 401(k) program, improved flight privileges, the introduction of domestic partner benefits and a new long-term care benefit.

We also reinvigorated our corporate training programs with the opening of FlagShip University, created a People Selection Center focused on more quickly identifying qualified new-hire candidates,and reaffirmed our commitment to giving our people a greater voice through 360 degree performance reviews and a company-wide employee survey . These positive initiatives notwithstanding, as we enter 2001, we face a number of unresolved issues associated with the unions representing many of our people, and those issues inject an element of uncertainty into our 2001 forecast. Nonetheless, we are confident that we will be able to reach agreements that meet the needs of the Company and all our employees, while avoiding any disruption of the American operation. As we scan the horizon for other matters affecting our business in 2001 and beyond, it is clear that Network ­ the sixth area of our Airline Leadership Plan ­ will continue to be key to American's success. In 2000, we pursued our goal of network leadership in a number of ways. First, we grew our domestic network in a very strategic manner, expanding our operations in cities like Boston, New York, Los Angeles and San Jose ­ cities that are very important to our prime business customers.

In 2001, we will build on our success by continuing to expand our San Jose schedule with new service to both Paris and Taipei. The Taipei service is particularly notable in that it will enable us to begin the expansion of our Pacific network by linking Silicon Valley with the very important technology industries of Taiwan. Closer to home, we're also pursuing Network Leadership through American Eagle's aggressive deployment of regional jets. In addition to strengthening and feeding our hubs ­ and putting hundreds of thousands of customers on American flights ­ these new aircraft have been effective weapons as we explore new point-to-point opportunities in markets previously considered other airlines' strongholds. At the end of 2000, the Eagle RJ fleet was 83 strong, and as we continue to grow and strengthen the Eagle fleet and network, the overall American network will get stronger as well. In the global arena, while the past two years have been a somewhat uncertain time when it comes to airline alliances, we continue to believe that with our oneworld partners ­ combined with our bilateral relationships with carriers such as Swissair, Sabena, JAL and EVA of Taiwan ­ we have built the industry's premier set of alliances. Indeed, despite a few speed bumps along the way, the effectiveness of our alliance strategy is clear. The traffic connecting to American from our partners has grown dramatically over the past two years.

While our 2000 network progress was impressive, three transactions announced in January 2001 represent a giant leap forward for our network building efforts. First, we agreed to purchase substantially all the assets of TWA for approximately $625 million in cash and the assumption of over $3 billion of TWA's obligations. Second, American will acquire certain key strategic assets from US Airways, including 14 gates, 36 slots, and 86 aircraft. We will also lease the gates and slots necessary for us to share the operation of the Northeast Shuttle with United Airlines. Under the terms of this transaction, we have agreed to pay $1.2 billion in cash to United Airlines and to assume approximately $300 million in aircraft operating leases. And third, American will acquire a 49 percent stake in DC Air, a new-entrant carrier operating out of Washington Reagan Airport. DC Air ­ to whom we will wet lease up to 14 Fokker 100 aircraft ­ will participate in the AAdvantage program, and American will have a right of first refusal on the acquisition of the remaining 51 percent of the new airline. The consummation of the DC Air transaction, as well as our acquisition of assets from US Airways, is contingent upon the closing of United's proposed merger with US Airways.

These three transactions mark the beginning of an exciting new chapter in American Airlines history and represent a very positive outcome for all three of our constituency groups. For our employees, these are terrific developments. We are growing the airline in a way that will bring a wealth of hiring and promotional opportunities for the people of American. For our customers, the benefits of a much broader network are clear. Our best customers ­ both individuals and large corporate accounts ­ increasingly expect their airline of choice to take them everywhere they want to go. We are determined to create a domestic and international network that is second to none. But at the same time, we do not intend to add more capacity to the industry than the growth in demand can justify. Our shareholders will be happy to know that these transactions will enable us, in a very economical way, to dramatically grow our airline without introducing incremental industry capacity. For a commitment of just over $5 billion, we are adding more than 270 airplanes to our fleet and acquiring a wealth of other assets in critical and strategic parts of our network. There is no other series of deals we could have made that would have given us this much breadth and strength for the amount of money we have committed. Moreover, even with $5 billion committed to these transactions, AMR's balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the airline industry. As always, the forecast for the year ahead contains a few unknowns, including the direction of both the U.S. economy and the price of jet fuel. Nonetheless, I believe AMR is in excellent shape to handle whatever 2001 has in store for us. Demand for our product ­ which we are working hard to improve ­ continues to grow.

We're committed to building a premier global network. We've got the best team of employees in the business, and new technologies are enabling all of us to do our jobs better and more profitably. Add it all up, and I believe that we have, in American and American Eagle, a very powerful and well-positioned franchise. And you have my assurance that all of us will be working hard in 2001 ­ to build on our 2000 success and to create positive outcomes for our customers, employees and shareholders. Donald J. Carty
