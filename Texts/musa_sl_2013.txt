      LETTER FROM OUR CHAIRMAN
   Fellow Shareholders:
It is my honor to welcome you to the new Murphy USA. On August 30, 2013, we launched Murphy USA as a stand-alone gasoline and convenience retail company and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on September 3rd under the ticker symbol MUSA.
The spin-off from Murphy Oil Corporation was designed to enhance MUSA’s ability to grow, innovate, build capabilities and focus on its core business as the leading low-price retailer in its sector.
That has been the focus of the new MUSA board of directors and management as we prepared for the separation and since. Gasoline and convenience retailing is a challenging and highly competitive business. That said, the history of retailers like MUSA with advantaged business models has shown that the returns can be outstanding. As shareholders, we have the opportunity to participate in MUSA’s exciting future while benefiting from a distinguished past.
Since the initial listing in 1956 under the leadership of Charles H. Murphy Jr., Murphy Oil established an exemplary track record of excellence in corporate governance and responsibility, innovation and returns to shareholders—MUSA benefits from and will build on this rich legacy. We have assembled a board of directors with a balance of continuity,
deep industry expertise and fresh new perspectives; your board is active and strong. The company has a strong management team with strategic vision and leadership, public company and financial acumen, and deep operational execution skills. As shareholders, we are positioned to capitalize on a clear and distinctive organic growth strategy, one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and a passion for executing the details of retail. As Chairman,
I have the privilege of leading MUSA’s board as we navigate the road ahead and deliver returns to our shareholders.
Murphy USA completed 2013 with a strong finish on a number of strategic and operational fronts and entered 2014 with momentum. We have an exciting and promising outlook and we appreciate the support you have shown by investing in our business.
R. MADISON MURPHY
