 Letter to Shareholders

  We Have the Resources for the Future
he robust commodity prices of 2005 drove a clear demarcation in the stock market between
energy companies such as EOG Resources that have the resources for the future and those that lack valuable long-term reinvestment opportunities. It isn’t by chance or luck that EOG Resources has developed into an even stronger resource company. The effectiveness of our long-term approach to the exploration and production business, which produced outstanding financial and operational results in 2005, has been realized.
Over the six-year period since EOG became an independent company, the strategy articulated annually in the letter to shareholders has remained remarkably consistent. We have reiterated the company’s relentless pursuit of capturing high rate of return assets — weighted in favor of natural gas reserves — in politically secure areas.
At EOG, we have accomplished a great deal:
• By perfecting new techniques in both exploration and development, we have

 identified significant North American resource plays that competitors have overlooked or underestimated,
• EOG has aggressively strengthened its rich reserve portfolio throughout the United States and Canada, in addition to realizing meaningful opportunities in Trinidad and the United Kingdom North Sea, and
• With a focus on returns, EOG has pursued organic production growth rather than seeking lower return large-scale acquisitions and mergers to bolster reserves and production.

Delivering On Our Promises
The marketplace rewarded EOG’s tenacity based on both its robust 2005 results and the recognition of its skill in identifying and developing resource plays that should be powerful growth engines for years to come.
EOG reported one of the very highest financial returns of the large cap peer group with 35.5 percent return on equity (2) and 30 percent return on capital employed (2) in 2005. Compared to the same benchmark group, EOG delivered the
    2 EOG Resources, Inc.

   highest return to shareholders (2) — 106 percent, ranking number four in the S&P 500 Index.
EOG reported net income available to common of $1,252 million in 2005, compared to $614 million for 2004. At year-end 2005, the company reported a debt-to-total capitalization ratio (2) of 19 percent, compared to 27 percent at December 31, 2004. The net debt-to-total capitalization ratio (2) was only 7 percent at year- end 2005.
Total company daily production increased 16.2 percent in 2005 over 2004, all organic growth achieved through the drillbit. This included a 12 percent increase in natural gas production
on a daily basis from the United States and Canada. Total daily production increased 40 percent last year from the United Kingdom North Sea and Trinidad, where EOG is supplying natural gas that is used as feedstock for the M5000 Methanol Plant and the Atlantic LNG Train 4, both of which started up during 2005.
Building on its firmly established North American asset base, during 2005 EOG underscored that the Barnett Shale Play in the Fort Worth Basin is a substantial company resource. By extending the play well beyond its conventional limits using horizontal drilling and enhanced completion technology, EOG has become an industry leader in the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale with over 500,000 net acres under lease across multiple counties. Applying the same parameters as it did to the Barnett Shale, EOG has accreted positions in new potential North American resource plays that will be tested over the course of 2006.
Our Employees Make the Difference
At EOG, it is not a cliché — our employees do make the difference. They represent an invaluable

  resource for the future, as important as the reserves that we seek to develop. EOG has created a fast-paced, exciting environment across the company in which the science of exploration and production thrives. Our creative, hardworking prospectors and those who support them not only utilize the latest technology available in the market, they adapt and modify it to meet EOG’s needs, thereby producing outstanding results.
We are proud of our EOG workforce. Our men and women not only care about performing their jobs extraordinarily well, they are concerned about the safety and welfare of those around them and the communities in which they live and work. It was an employee- driven effort that galvanized EOG’s effort to raise $1 million to help those whose lives were torn apart by Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita. The management team and board of directors recognize and encourage the unique individual contributions of our top-notch people to EOG’s success.
Our Goals for 2006 and Beyond
EOG will never be satisfied with the status quo. To be the best — not the biggest — independent exploration and production company in North America remains our goal. EOG defines ‘best’ in simple terms — generating the highest total shareholder returns. In addition, we strive to be the most profitable independent exploration and production company in terms of return on equity and return on capital employed.
Because we see no significant long-term change in the global natural gas and oil supply

fundamentals, EOG will continue its consistent strategy of building the company for the future by focusing on our strong organic growth platform rather than making decisions based on short-term fluctuations in the financial and energy markets.
Based on our deep prospect inventory, EOG is targeting an increase in total company production of 10.5 percent for 2006 compared to 2005, while we expect to achieve a 7 to 11 percent annual production increase between 2007 and 2010. In

With more than 500,000 net acres under lease and a multi-year drilling program underway, EOG is a major player in this dynamic Fort Worth Basin resource.
    North America, contributions from both the Fort Worth Basin Barnett Shale and our other extensive captured assets will fuel this increase.
We will further expand EOG’s position in multiple North American resource plays through the application of horizontal drilling. We will also continue to seek additional new prospects on this continent. We expect EOG’s Trinidad and United Kingdom assets, which already are well on the way to emulating the company’s success in the

  United States and Canada, to gather additional momentum.
EOG will continue to place a high emphasis on superior reinvestment rates of return from our capital program and wisely utilize any free cash flow. We will operate with a low level of debt, providing our company with the flexibility to consider different reinvestment opportunities that include adding acreage, further developing existing drilling programs and identifying possible big-target resource plays. We will work hard to maintain the company’s reputation as a low-cost
operator and a financially conservative organization with high ethical standards.
Looking Forward
Industry-wide, we expect the valuation chasm to widen between companies like EOG Resources that can grow organically through the drillbit and those that are short of attractive reinvestment opportunities. EOG has the resources to maintain long-term performance and sustainability that will translate into superior shareholder value for the future. While consistency will remain our company’s hallmark, the word ‘resources’ in our name is EOG’s pledge of performance yet to come.
