CHAIRMAN'S LETTER

To Our Shareholders:
Fiscal Year 2012 was a period of continued, profitable growth at HARMAN. We posted our eleventh straight quarter of year-on-year improvement at both top and bottom line, we booked multi-year strategic business awards with leading customers, and we continued to advance the agendas of innovation and operational excellence that will make HARMAN a stronger, more competitive company year after year. Net sales in fiscal year 2012 were $4.4 billion, an increase of 16 percent from the prior year. Sales increased in all three divisions and the Company continued to gain share in selected markets. Operating income in fiscal year 2012 was $300 million, an increase of 58 percent compared to the prior year. Our cash and short-term investments balance stood at $820 million at year end, and our total liquidity of $1.4 billion gives us the continued flexibility to meet our business obligations as we pursue strategic opportunities for growth. All three HARMAN divisions posted sales growth during the year, fueled by dozens of new product innovations, continued emerging markets penetration, and aggressive brand marketing. The Infotainment Division increased net sales by 15 percent and more than doubled operating income. The Lifestyle Division increased net sales by 22 percent and grew operating income by one-third. The Professional Division increased net sales by six percent while strengthening its competitive position with new production capacity in China. HARMAN's achievements during fiscal year 2012 are closely aligned with the Company's defined four-pillar strategy to grow our smart infotainment solutions business, increase penetration of our branded audio systems, pursue aggressive growth in the emerging markets, and drive continued improvement in our cost and capital structure.

HARMAN's achievements during fiscal year 2012 are closely aligned with the Company's defined four-pillar strategy to grow our smart infotainment solutions business, increase penetration of our branded audio systems, pursue aggressive growth in the emerging markets, and drive continued improvement in our cost and capital structure.

As the year began, HARMAN announced a realignment of its division structure ­ in order to recognize the convergence of consumer electronic devices across multiple markets, better leverage the public mind share fueled by our premium brands, and optimize reporting transparency for our stakeholders. We partitioned our large Infotainment business as a separate division to underscore the dramatic sales and profitability improvements we are making in this space, driven by HARMAN's quick-to-market scalable systems approach. We have also energized the brand awareness that drives every HARMAN business with new customer ambassadors including Sir Paul McCartney, Jennifer Lopez, Tim McGraw, Maroon 5, China's Liu Huan, India's A. R. Rahman, and others. Our Infotainment business achieved several significant wins during the year, including a $2 billion multi-year award from BMW, a $400 million extension of our relationship with Volkswagen Group, and more than $500 million in new emerging markets business from domestic automakers such as China's BAIC, Changan and Geely brands, and India's Tata Motors. To meet the growing demand for entry-level embedded infotainment systems, we also launched a new scalable infotainment platform targeting entry- and mid-segment vehicles. Our Lifestyle division continued to support current market trends with new product introductions geared to the soaring popularity of smart phones, tablet computers, and home theater entertainment. We launched new branded audio systems for leading automakers including BMW, Ferrari, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes, MINI, smart and SsangYong. Leveraging the synergies between personal multimedia and in-car infotainment, our Aha Radio brand rolled out a new cloud-based service that will delight our loyal customers with thousands of online music stations, news, audio books, personalized traffic reports, and audio-based social media interaction. Five additional premium automakers embraced the robust Aha platform.

vision with such innovations as real-time smart phone integration via Near Field Communications, a Situational Human Machine Interface that provides drivers with highly personalized in-car data, Augmented Navigation that blends live video with GPS-based map displays for greater clarity, and a revolutionary Parking Assistant that mixes live camera views from the vehicle with virtual reality modeling of the surrounding space. We remain sharply focused on eliminating potential driver distractions as vehicles and their occupants become more connected with the world around them. Millions of HARMAN customers already control their in-car infotainment systems and various vehicle functions via simple voice commands, and others enjoy access to "hands-free, eyes-free" infotainment that converts diverse Web or message content to streaming audio. We recently took yet another step toward multi-sensory human interface as we demonstrated gesture-based controls that will let drivers manage in-car systems with simple hand movements. With an eye to further nurturing our long-term business model, HARMAN published its first Sustainability Report during fiscal year 2012 -- dedicated to the core principles of generating shareholder value and promoting safe, sound enjoyment; innovating to improve our environmental performance; and making sound investments in our people and communities. We continue to take definitive steps in each area. Recognizing that HARMAN's talented people are integral to our long-term success, we continue to empower our team through innovative training programs at every level, and we link a portion of every key employee's compensation to the achievement of specific personal and group goals. We strengthened our top-level talent pool during the fiscal year with the addition of Samsung Electronics veteran I. P. Park as Chief Technology Officer, and the appointment of former Tyco International Chief Financial Officer Frank Sklarsky to the HARMAN Board of Directors. Our seasoned, multinational leadership and governance team

Our Professional division continued to support talented performers such as Lady Antebellum, Neil Diamond, Jimmy Buffet, and Lenny Kravitz on tour, and completed more than 20 major stadium and venue installations around the world ­ from Staples Center in Los Angeles to the People's Great Hall in Beijing. We also provided premium audio systems for such landmark events as the 2012 London Olympics, Super Bowl XLVI, and the 54th annual GRAMMY® Awards where HARMAN again served as official sound partner. The Professional division's innovative new IDX Information Delivery System for large public spaces was installed in eight international airports and railway centers. Our sales performance in the emerging markets was particularly dramatic, with steadily-increasing BRIC country sales led by a 42 percent increase in China. We have now added nearly 3,800 employees in best-cost countries -- highlighted during fiscal year 2012 by the opening of HARMAN's largest new manufacturing and R&D facility in Dandong, China, a new engineering center in Chengdu, and our second Chinese flagship store in Beijing. We will continue to add resources at our multiple development facilities in India and China, and we are strengthening our resources in Russia and Brazil as we pursue such milestone opportunities as the 2014 Winter Olympics, the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and 2016 Summer Olympics. Across these many achievements, cutting-edge HARMAN innovation remains a common catalyst for growth. We added some 700 new patents and filings during fiscal year 2012, bringing our invention portfolio to more than 4,400. We earned distinguished supplier awards from Ferrari and Toyota during the year, and formed new partnerships with other leading innovators including Sierra Wireless, Texas Instruments, Broadcom, NXP and Freescale. This commitment to innovation continues to differentiate HARMAN from its competitors. Our energy-efficient GreenEdgeTM audio and infotainment systems deliver premium performance at twice the power and weight efficiency of traditional systems. We have advanced the HARMAN "Connected Car"

talent
remains a differentiating HARMAN strength, and we have built a robust talent bench with which to seize future opportunities. We continue to reach out to the communities where we live and work through a variety of educational and sponsorship programs focused on our passion for education, music and the arts. We delivered on a key environmental stewardship target by achieving a five percent reduction in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions at several key facilities during the second half of the fiscal year, and we are extending this program and its proven principles to HARMAN facilities worldwide. Beyond our steadily improving financial performance, we took several additional steps to increase shareholder value during fiscal year 2012 ­ doubling our annual dividend and launching a $200 million share repurchase program. Two major ratings agencies upgraded Harman's outlook midway through the fiscal year, and both Standard and Poor's and Moody's have raised the Company's corporate credit rating to investment grade as this report goes to press. I am very proud of HARMAN's management team and the thousands of talented employees worldwide who have embraced our culture of continuous improvement. Our team is energized to carry this performance into fiscal year 2013, and we look forward to the continued support of our customers, employees, and shareholders toward cementing HARMAN's position as the clear global leader in audio and infotainment. Best regards,
