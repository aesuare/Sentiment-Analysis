 04 autoliv 2011 / President’s Letter
Dear Shareholder,
 2011 was autoliv’s best year ever.
• sales increased by 15% to a record high of $8.2 billion
• operating income was up 2% to a record high of $889 million
• earnings per share was up 4% to a record high of $6.65
these records are due to our transformation of autoliv and our continued strong outperformance of the market. autoliv’s organic sales (i.e. excluding currency effects and acquisitions) grew by 9% which was three times more than the increase in global light vehicle Production (lvP). in addition, acquisitions added 2% and currency effects 4%.
autoliv’s exceptional performance compared to the lvP is the result of our technological leadership and early investments in growth markets. in China, for instance, organic sales were up three times more than the 4% increase in Chinese lvP.
the fact that operating income improved less than sales was due to higher raw material prices and higher R,D&E spending. these increases reduced operating margin by 1.6 percentage points. Despite this, we managed to limit the reduction in oper- ating income to 1.3 percentage points and report a double-digit operating margin of 10.8%, the second highest margin ever despite unusually high legal costs due to the ongoing antitrust investigations (see page 39).
Furthermore, autoliv’s strong performance and solid balance sheet (the Company is now net-debt free) allowed us to increase dividends to shareholders by nearly $100 million to $154 million during 2011, the highest amount ever.
Continued Transformation
our strong performance in 2011 reflects the transformation our Company has undergone since the summer of 2008 when we announced a comprehensive restructuring program. We estimate that these actions now save us more than $200 mil- lion each year.
additionally, when global lvP started to recover in the fall of 2009, most of the growth occurred in asia and other low-cost countries (lCC), where we had been investing for long-term growth and strategically building a strong presence.
as a result, autoliv’s sales are better balanced (see graph). Now, Europe, the americas and asia account for 38%, 31% and 31%, respectively, of sales compared to 54%, 27% and 18% before the crisis. China alone accounts for 12% of sales com- pared to 4% in 2007.
this sales mix improvement is also important due to the fact that lvP is expected to continue to grow the most in asia and other lCC over the next several years.
additionally, autoliv now has 66% of its workforce in lCC compared to 54% at the end of June 2008 and 71% of the work-
force are direct workers in manufacturing compared to 66% before the restructuring program was announced. Not only have these changes enhanced autoliv’s resilience in the cyclical automotive industry, but they have also improved profitability by lowering the Company’s break-even point and securing greater labor flexibility.
Investments in New Technologies
the 2011 record results also reflect our investments in R&D. in the midst of the crisis in 2009, we initiated a special R&D program for small car safety that is now helping to drive our sales. During the last few years, we have also increased our R&D for active safety and made a number of strategic acquisitions in this product area. as a result, sales of active safety systems almost doubled during 2011 to $160 million. additionally, we introduced our first camera-based vision system (see page 12). Given current trends (see graph on the next page showing the development of unit sales and vehicle models with our active safety systems), we expect sales of these systems to continue to grow rapidly and exceed half a billion dollars by 2015. this would increase our market share for these products from 20% to approximately 30%.
For future sales it was also important that we, in 2011, re- ceived our first order in the $6 billion brake control market. our cost-efficient and innovative design (see page 12) will start generating sales in 2014.
these investments in active safety may turn out to be a paradigm shift comparable to when autoliv led the start of the airbag market and transformed the entire automotive safety industry from only seatbelts some 20 years ago. this means that we will save even more lives than the over 25,000 lives per year currently saved.
Quality in all Dimensions
although quality has always been paramount in the automotive safety systems business, vehicle manufacturers have become even more quality focused and quality sensitive, particularly over the last couple of years. i welcome this commitment to quality, even if this trend could lead to more recalls, because the trend is good for consumers (i. e. the vehicle owners) and - long term - for autoliv as a technology and quality leader.
to advance our quality leadership we launched, in 2010, a pro-active quality initiative, called Q5.
During 2011, we expanded this program by training and in- volving more employees in the Q5 activities to advance our leadership position.
Outlook
iHS expects global lvP to grow by 4% during 2012. However, virtually all of the lvP increase is expected to occur in growth

  markets with relatively low average safety content vehicles or in Japan where autoliv’s market share is lower than in other markets. in addition, lvP in the important European market is expected to decline by 8% during the year.
Despite this negative geographical lvP mix, we expect to continue to outperform global lvP and increase autoliv’s organic sales by around 7% based on iHS’s lvP data. this strong performance is mainly due to a favorable vehicle model mix. Currency effects are expected to reduce sales by approximately 3%, provided that mid-January currency exchange rates prevail. Consequently, consolidated sales are expected to increase by nearly 4% for the year 2012.
as a consequence of the mixed lvP trends, our manufacturing capacity needs to be aligned with the demand in the individual markets. the cost for these alignments are currently difficult to as- sess, but they could be more than $50 million. in parallel with these capacity alignments, we will increase R,D&E expenses, net by more than $60 million to drive future growth.
Excluding the capacity alignment costs and excluding costs related to the ongoing antitrust investigations, we expect to reach an operating margin in the range of 10-11%. included in this
Net Sales per Region
indication is a 0.8 percentage point (p.p.). negative margin effect from the R,D&E increase.
Currently we maintain an unusually strong bal- ance sheet with a net cash position. We started to build this prudent balance sheet to have ad- equate resources for acquisitions. Subsequently, two additional reasons have emerged. First, the macroeconomic outlook is unusually difficult to forecast in response to which we also maintain a high level of temporary employees (20% of our total workforce). Secondly, a strong balance sheet will better prepare us to respond to the probable outcome of the antitrust investigations.
Since we may need cash for all three of these purposes within a relatively short time span and given that none of the amounts needed for these purposes are currently possible to estimate, we believe it to be prudent to maintain, for the time being, a high level of financial flexibility until more transparency has been obtained regarding the outcome of these events.
A Changing Year
in hindsight, 2011 may give the impression to have been an unchallenging year with all its records. at the beginning, it looked indeed as if we would be able to take a breath after the financial crisis
in 2008 and 2009 and after the sharp and chal- lenging recovery in lvP in 2010. little did we know that 2011 would comprise two natural disasters, a sovereign debt crisis, a business hold from our largest customer and many other surprises.
it is a testimony to the stamina of our employ- ees that autoliv managed to set so many records despite all these unforeseen events. i therefore want to extend a sincere “thank you” to autoliv’s 48,000 employees for a job well done.
Finally, i want to thank lars Westerberg, who has resigned from the Company after nearly 13 years, for his devoted service to autoliv. i also want to thank our former chairman, Jay Stewart, who resigned after 22 years on the Boards of autoliv and its predecessor company.
Yours sincerely,
Jan Carlson
