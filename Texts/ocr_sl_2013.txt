proposition. The results of this new sales strategy were clear and compelling; we increased the number of beds added in 2013 by 32%. Similarly, we reorganized our Long- Term Care Group operations to create more visibility,
while also integrating our account management team into operations to increase customer responsiveness. Our customer retention rate increased 260 basis points to 93.7%, which also represented our best performance of any year in recent history. Collectively, the benefits we realized from our centralized operations and redesigned go-to-market strategy led to three consecutive quarters of net organic bed growth to close out the year, culminating in the first full year of net organic bed growth in ten years.
While the infrastructure of our Specialty Care Group
was largely in place as we entered 2013, we increased our investment in business development to better capitalize
on the valuable support services we bring to the growing specialty pharmaceutical arena. Our heightened focus on enhancing our selling effectiveness generated a favorable outcome, as our Specialty Care Group revenues increased 28% with each of our four specialty care operating platforms yielding higher sales results. Contributing to our success was the refinement of our go-to-market messaging to ensure we convey the value of the fully integrated commercialization solution we offer to better enable continuity through a single program throughout the patient lifecycle. We believe this integrated approach for these services provides a compelling end-to-end solution for manufacturers, positioning us well as

Consistent Capital Returns
As our operations have come together to form a solid foundation, we believe we have better leveraged our strong cash flows to create additional value. Notably, we increased our dividend payments by 43% in 2013, with our current annualized dividend rate of $0.80 per share representing
a 20% payout ratio based on our 2013 results. While
the dividend has become a bigger portion of our capital allocation strategy, we also continue to have a very active stock repurchase program. In 2013, we repurchased an additional 4.8 million shares at an average price of $50.97, which is 16% lower than our 2013 year-end stock price of $60.36. Overall, we returned 59% of our operating cash flows(1) to stockholders in 2013 through dividends and stock repurchases. One of the inherent values of our company
is ourrobust cash flows. Ensuring we employ a disciplined approach toward capital deployment better positions us to continue generating consistent returns for our stockholders.
Platform for Growth
With the appropriate operational infrastructure in place
and a methodical approach to capital allocation, we believe we are also better positioned to optimize our strategic orientation. Across our two segments, Long-Term Care and Specialty Care, we operate under six platforms(2) that provide

    a comprehensive view of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Through these platforms Ð skilled nursing pharmacy, assisted living pharmacy, specialty pharmacy, brand support services, supply chain solutions, and patient support services Ð we serve a broad mix of patient populations; we have a diverse mix of customers (from institutional facilities to pharma- ceutical manufacturers); and we provide services for
both branded and generic pharmaceuticals, spanning most therapeutic categories. As the healthcare continuum continues to evolve in such a way that providers and services become more fully integrated into a patient-centered care model, we believe our comprehensive approach will provide us unparalleled insight into patient care.
Due to the unwavering commitment of our 14,000 employees, we built a strong foundation upon which we can better leverage our value proposition on behalf of our customers. Moreover, Omnicare is proud to have increased total stock- holder returns by 69% in 2013. We look forward to creating more value for our employees, customers and stockholders well into the future.
