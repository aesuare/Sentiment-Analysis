In 2009, we delivered strong, high-quality results while continuing to build an even stronger Kellogg Company for the future.
Dear Shareowners,
Thanks to the hard work and passion of our 31,000 Kellogg employees around the world, the strength of Kellogg was demonstrated again in 2009 with another year of sustainable and dependable  performance. By any measure, this was one of the most challenging operating environments in decades. However, we are pleased that despite the backdrop of a difficult economic environment and a tough competitive landscape, 2009 was a very good year for Kellogg. We once again delivered high quality results while building an even stronger company. Kellogg grew internal net sales, operating profit and earnings per share at, or above, our long-term annual targets.  · We posted 3 percent growth in Internal Net Sales, driven by a particularly strong year in cereal and a solid year in snacks.  · We delivered a 10 percent improvement in Internal Operating Profit, reflecting the success of our cost savings and productivity initiatives.   · We generated $3.16 Earnings per Share, a 13 percent increase on a currency-neutral basis.
David Mackay CEO Jim Jenness Chairman of the Board

Our well-known and trusted brands are the strength of Kellogg. As a focused, branded food company, we provide a balanced portfolio of brands that reaches consumers around the world. The key to our success is in the way we strengthen our brands to keep them relevant, resonant and powerful with consumers. Consumers demand variety and convenience, and, now more than ever, value. Consumers are trading into our core categories--such as cereal--in markets like the United States and the United Kingdom, and they recognize that Kellogg brands deliver on those needs. We operate in two of the strongest categories in the food industry--cereal and snacks--as well as frozen foods. Our strategy is to expand our cereal and snack business throughout the world and grow our frozen foods business in North America. Through leveraging the power of our brands and our proven ability to execute, we are intent on expanding our share in these categories. The ready-to-eat cereal category is robust and growing on a global basis. Its strong appeal to consumers continues even during this weak economy, as consumers seek greater value in addition to taste and convenience. Our cereal portfolio continues to perform well, not only in the U.S., but around the globe in Mexico, Australia, Canada and other core markets. In the U.S. we continue to drive growth and advertising support behind our top eight brands plus Kashi.

The cereal category continues to be on trend with demo graphic shifts around the world. Our strong portfolio of adult cereals is well positioned, meeting the needs of aging baby boomers seeking foods that aid them with weight management and digestive health. Our goal is to be consumers' top choice within these c ategories and also the leader in category growth. To  accomplish this, we must develop new products to  satisfy the consumer. The strength of Kellogg lies in our world-class innovation capabilities. Our innovation process begins and ends with the consumer. Our product development capabilities-- both in innovation (developing new products) and renovation (improving existing  products)--are critical to our continued success. We c ontinue to invest in projects that  expand our capabilities, focus our development efforts on strengthening our core brands and the equity behind them, and maintain a balanced port folio of food offerings across our categories, markets, and brands.

We generated record cash flow of nearly $1.3 billion. We fulfilled our com mit ment of returning cash to shareowners by increasing our dividend by 10 percent and returning nearly three-quarters of a  billion dollars through dividends and share repurchases. Instead of viewing the economic climate as a roadblock--we see it as an oppor tunity. We intend to emerge from this economic crisis as an even stronger, more focused, more effective  organization. Throughout 2009, we invested in our strengths--building our brands in our core categories, spending effectively on brand-building advertising and marketing, innovating and renovating our products to meet our consumers' changing needs, and identifying and implementing efficiencies and cost savings throughout our organization. This investment lays the groundwork for continued sustainable and depend able performance now and well into the future.

The strength of Kellogg is our long history of heavily investing in advertising and marketing to  support our new and established brands. In 2009, we took advantage of the significant media deflation in a number of our markets. Rather than cutting back on advertising spending, we invested even more--over $1 billion in advertising-- In 2009, we completed the expansion of our W.K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research, our world class R&D facility where we develop and  renovate products to meet our consumers' changing needs and tastes. The open atmosphere of this facility fosters collaboration among diverse team members, converging the strengths of varying talents and knowledge bases. Our pilot plant and super-kitchen improvements allow for rapid proto typing and multiple, simultaneous prototyping streams, both of which are critical to quickly launching successful innovation into the  marketplace. Continued investment in our open innovation program enables us to benefit from outside research from around the world to supplement our internal development capabilities. We are seeing positive results in our three areas of focus--technology, strategic alliances with world-class research partners, and our online Great Ideas portal. We also strengthened our brands through renovation. Applying new ideas to adjust the ingredients and nutrients in our existing foods, keeps our successful brands  relevant with consumers today and in the future, thereby protecting these equities going forward. Recent renovations focused on reducing sugar, sodium and fats. We're also enhancing the nutritional value and benefits our foods offer. For example, in 2009 we added fiber to Froot Loops and Apple Jacks in the United States as well as Froot Loops and Corn Pops in Canada. We continue to embrace digital marketing, investing heavily in digital capabilities, online campaigns and partnerships with experts in the space. In 2009, we partnered with leaders in the digital industry, such as Facebook for We have strengthened our core brands through innovation of new products and flavors. Among our many innovations in 2009, we extended our largest brand, Special K, even social media and Microsoft for technology architecture. We began investing in new technology infrastructures within Kellogg, increasing our ability to

resulting in more consumer impressions and a greater impact from each  dollar spent. To optimize our brand building, we consolidated our advertising agencies, market researchers and other vendors to create greater scale across the globe, improv ing the effectiveness of our advertising. We realigned our brands and marketing strategies by geographic regions to create even more advantages from scale. Soon after we consolidated our market research, we realized the benefit. We completed a broad-based   market research study in all of our major ready-to-eat cereal markets. Our global research found that adult females  across a variety of cultures share the same  concerns and needs when it concerns health and weight management. So when we had early successes in the United Kingdom with a Special K marketing campaign "Moments of Truth," we were able to roll it out across a variety of markets that were culturally very  d ifferent. We had great results-- Special K continues to grow globally at nearly double-digit rates--triple-digit in India. And, although only recently launched in South Korea, Special K is already a top cereal brand in that country.

The strength of Kellogg is our employees. The guiding principles of our K Values provide a positive and strong foundation for everyone in the Kellogg organization. Around the world, our employees are committed to excellence, focused on achieving our goals and eager  to embrace new challenges. The experience, ideas, and ingenuity of the employees throughout Kellogg Company have generated a multi-year pipeline of cost-savings initiatives and efficiency improvements. In 2009, the entire Kellogg organization was challenged to deliver $1 billion in annual cost savings by the end of 2011. Our employees rose to the challenge, and we are currently on track to exceed that goal. We dramatically increased our invest ment in pro duc tivity and cost- saving initiatives during 2009 to a level equivalent to

We are investing the savings from these initiatives back into the business, providing fuel for future growth. Supporting the $1 billion cost challenge is K-Lean, our ongoing initiative to drive continuous annual improvement.  Lean principles ensure that our supply chain culture continues to foster improvement, drive waste reduction,  create incremental capacity, optimize manufacturing operations, and uphold exemplary quality and safety stan dards--all while enhancing our focus on consumer and customer satisfaction. We began the implementation of Lean principles in our North American cereal operations in 2008. In 2009, we expanded K-Lean globally throughout our manufacturing network, and followed with a broad implementation encompassing our supply chain support systems. We will eventually leverage these concepts across the entire Company. We see Lean as a culture-changing process that will take us to new levels of cross-functional collaboration and continuous improvement. Our long-term approach to making our business more efficient and effective rather than simply cutting functional costs will benefit us for years to come. Already in 2009, cost and capacity improvement activities combined with top-line growth helped to expand gross margins. Jim Jenness Chairman of the Board David Mackay President and Chief Executive Officer As we enter 2010, we anticipate that the operating environment will remain challenging for Kellogg, our retailers and our consumers. However, we will maintain our focus on consumers, anticipating their changing needs and tastes and keeping our products relevant. We will continue to invest aggressively to support our brands. Our implementation of productivity and cost savings initiatives in 2009 has given us excellent financial visibility into our 2010 financial performance. By setting realistic financial targets, we will make decisions based on the long-term benefit to our Company and to our shareowners. We could not achieve success without our consumers, our par tners, our employees, and, especially, our shareowners. Thank you for your continued confidence  and support. We will continue to execute our sustainable growth model and focused business strategy to deliver sustainable and dependable performance-- that is the strength of Kellogg.
