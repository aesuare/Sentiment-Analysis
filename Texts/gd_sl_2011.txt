LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS

Dear Fellow Shareholders, For General Dynamics, 2011 was a year of continued focus on operating performance, excellent cash generation and accelerating Aerospace growth. Our company's success is anchored by a strong foundation of relevant products and services, a commitment to continuous improvement, and an innovative workforce. As economic headwinds impact U.S. defense spending, the strength of General Dynamics' portfolio is ever more apparent. Our Aerospace segment, driven by market leader Gulfstream, is preparing to deliver two new aircraft to the world, the G650 and G280. These aircraft highlight the importance of our sustained investment in new products and are at the forefront of technological development among business aircraft. Following a decade of growth, we are now in a new era where defense spending is declining. Despite this reality, our diverse defense businesses remain resilient and valuable assets and we continue to feel confident about the relevance of our portfolio. Our facilities are key parts of the defense industrial base which must be maintained. We have solid incumbency in the Army and Navy force structures. We can leverage our incumbency, innovation and experience both to bid as a prime competitor for new development programs, and to provide our customer with steady and dependable proven solutions. As of this writing in early 2012, the defense market is shrouded by the uncertainty of sequestration which could impose $500 billion of additional defense spending cuts over the next nine years if the Congress does not act. If enacted, sequestration would place extreme fiscal pressures

Jay L. Johnson Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

on our customers, with wide-ranging effects on our industry and the security of our nation. However sequestration is resolved, it is clear that defense spending will continue to be a part of addressing our nation's economic problems. Amidst a backdrop of continued deficit focus and political divide, we were pleased by the support our programs received in the fiscal year 2012 defense budget. For fiscal year 2013, the President has requested Defense Department base-budget funding of $525 billion, including $168 billion for investment accounts. Our core shipbuilding and tactical communications programs fared well in the proposed budget. Conversely, funding for our primary U.S. vehicle programs, Stryker and Abrams, declined significantly. These funding levels reflect lower Army investment spending as the Pentagon shifts priorities. We will work with all of our stakeholders to ensure they understand the industrial base implications of significant funding reductions. As we confront a fast-changing business environment, we continue to focus on maximizing profitability. Over the past few years, we have cut overhead costs, improved manufacturing processes, divested certain non-core assets, and right-sized businesses to better position ourselves for the future. These actions will enhance the affordability of our products for our customers, improve the profitability of our business for our shareholders and strengthen our competitive positioning for the long-term benefit of our company and our employees. Report on Operations Company revenues were $32.7 billion in 2011, a modest increase from 2010, as initial deliveries of the G650 drove double-digit volume growth in our

Aerospace group. Operating earnings were $3.8 billion as each of our three defense segments improved operating margins. Free cash flow totaled $2.8 billion after capital expenditures and contributions to our pension plans. This robust cash flow represents 109 percent of earnings from continuing operations, maintaining our trend of efficient cash conversion. The results reported below show that our passion for disciplined execution remains a core focus throughout our four operating segments. Aerospace Aerospace was the company's growth engine in 2011. The group's revenues were $6 billion, up 13 percent from 2010, while operating earnings were $729 million. Initial G650 deliveries and robust demand for aircraft services across our global network propelled this revenue growth. The group's earnings include charges taken at Jet Aviation's completions business resulting from lingering performance challenges on several narrow-body/wide-body aircraft projects and the significant decline in other manufacturers' businessjet completions work. A new management team is instituting necessary measures to improve Jet Aviation's completions business and position it for new opportunities in 2012. Business-jet market indicators were favorable again in 2011 as aircraft utilization improved, emerging market demand strengthened and pre-owned inventory levels gradually declined.

Gulfstream's installed fleet surpassed peak 2008 flying hours last year, a reality that helped our service facilities enjoy record volumes. First-in-class service is elemental to Gulfstream's brand and we are working diligently to ensure that our service network remains well positioned to serve our increasingly diverse and widespread customer base. In pursuit of this goal, we expanded several facilities, enhanced our global parts inventories and added personnel in strategic footholds across the world, including China, England, Singapore and Spain. In 2011, Gulfstream booked the highest number of orders since the economic downturn began in 2008. This healthy demand enabled an increase in backlog to $17.9 billion. Our large-cabin G450 and G550 order book remains at about 18 to 24 months from new order to delivery, while backlog for our new G650 aircraft reaches into 2017. Gulfstream orders continue to favor our large-cabin aircraft although we are seeing gradual mid-cabin improvement. International customer demand remains robust, representing approximately 70 percent of 2011 orders. Asia-Pacific customer interest has been particularly strong in the past year, an encouraging trend in an underserved market with significant long-term potential. North American demand also continues to rebound, including higher Fortune 500 activity. This resurgence is an extremely positive sign particularly in light of the unfounded yet pervasive political rhetoric that has impacted our industry in the United States in recent years.

Gulfstream continues to make significant progress in product development, to include receiving provisional type certifications from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for the G650 and the G280. Both aircraft remain on track to achieve full FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency certification and entry into service in mid-2012. Our $500 million, seven-year investment in Gulfstream's Savannah campus proceeded apace in 2011, including a significant expansion of the group's research and development center. This project will enable us to deliver new products to market and ensure that our business is sized to accommodate a rapidly expanding global customer base. The Aerospace group is poised for doubledigit sales growth again in 2012 as G650 deliveries increase and our service business expands. In the years ahead, shareholders will continue to benefit from our Gulfstream investments as we increase production of new aircraft, introduce enhanced products to the market and leverage the growing global installed base of business jets requiring maintenance and aircraft services. Combat Systems The Combat Systems group performed very well in 2011, once again leading the company in operating earnings. For the year, group sales were $8.8 billion while earnings were $1.3 billion. This represents a modest decline in sales from last year, the result of lower U.S. vehicle volume. International light armored vehicle (LAV) upgrades and axles for military and

commercial manufacturers helped to mitigate the U.S. vehicle decline. Cost reduction and productivity improvements enabled margins to expand ten basis points to 14.5 percent despite lower volume. In 2011, Combat Systems enjoyed its largest order intake in several years with sizeable awards reflecting continued demand for our U.S., European and Foreign Military Sales vehicle programs. The group's year-end backlog totaled $11.4 billion, with $10.3 billion fully funded. Notable U.S. orders in 2011 included approximately $1.4 billion for Stryker production and sustainment and $570 million for Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicle upgrades. The group's $2 billion in international awards included LAV and tank upgrades for several foreign customers who are modernizing their vehicle fleets. Combat Systems' international sales continued to grow in 2011, with export and foreign direct sales representing approximately 34 percent of the group's volume. This trend will continue over the next several years as we progress on several multi-year LAV and tank programs, which accounted for nearly 40 percent of the group's year-end backlog. Beyond our ongoing contracts, we anticipate a number of meaningful international opportunities in North America and the Middle East. At the end of 2011, we further enhanced Combat Systems' portfolio with the addition of Force Protection. This acquisition expands the group's tactical wheeled vehicle product portfolio to include thousands of combat-proven vehicles. Additionally,

with Force Protection onboard, Combat Systems is better positioned to compete for vehicle sustainment and development opportunities globally. As we look to the future, it is clear that budgetary pressures will impact spending for our U.S. Army customer. Amidst the uncertainty of competing spending priorities, the flexibility and operational success of our Abrams tanks and Stryker vehicles are undisputed. The successful development and implementation of the Stryker double-V hull innovation illustrates our ability to rapidly enhance the effectiveness of existing Army platforms. We anticipate further opportunities to help our customer affordably reconstitute and modernize the force, particularly given the customer's desire for enhanced mobility. The Combat Systems business will also be extremely competitive in new vehicle development programs. Combat Systems' battle-proven platforms, munitions and weapons systems have demonstrated their strength, reliability and adaptability throughout the past decade of war. The group's innovative workforce, substantial international workload, successful cost-cutting initiatives, and healthy opportunity set position it to navigate a decidedly more difficult environment moving forward. Marine Systems The Marine Systems group delivered another strong performance in 2011 with sales totaling $6.6 billion while earnings improved 2.5 percent to $691 million. The group's 10.4 percent operating margin reflects the commitment to manufacturing excellence across our shipyards and improved performance on the T-AKE auxiliary surface ship program throughout 2011. Marine's year-end backlog totaled $18.5 billion. Several awards received in 2011 position the group for success in 2012 and over the next several years, including two additional Zumwalt-class destroyers ­ DDGs 1001 and 1002; two DDG-51 destroyers; two Mobile Landing Platform (MLP) ships; and additional repair work. The group's surface ship and submarine repair businesses continued to grow in 2011. We enhanced this growth with the acquisition of Metro Machine, a Norfolk-based naval repair yard. Metro Machine

provides General Dynamics the opportunity to extend our surface ship maintenance footprint to the East Coast and enhances our competitive positioning for future repair opportunities. Looking to the future, Marine Systems has an experienced workforce, an enduring backlog and an excellent reputation for delivering affordable, highquality ships and repair services. The group is well positioned to compete for a number of opportunities on the horizon, including the next block of Virginiaclass submarines, additional DDG-51s, the SSBN replacement program, and new commercial work. Notably, the value of our Navy's global mission was reaffirmed by the Pentagon's recent Roles and Missions Study which emphasized the importance of maintaining a stabilizing military presence in certain areas of the world, especially the Asia-Pacific region. This bodes well for our shipbuilders. Information Systems and Technology Information Systems and Technology (IS&T) delivered solid operating earnings totaling $1.2 billion in 2011 despite top-line pressures. Group sales were $11.2 billion, down 3 percent from 2010, due to lower volume on tactical communications programs. This lower volume was primarily the result of sluggish award activity caused by U.S. defense budget delays and prolonged customer acquisition cycles. Despite these significant pressures, the group's IT service business delivered another year of organic growth driven by several large IT infrastructure projects and success in capturing a variety of new business opportunities. IS&T's operating margins were 10.7 percent in 2011. This healthy margin reflects the group's ongoing optimization and cost-cutting actions made in anticipation of the slowdown in the business' acquisition cycles. These proactive measures will help to mitigate inevitable pressure on the group's margins as our successful but lower-margin service business grows and competitive pressures intensify. Although many of the group's anticipated orders were delayed in 2011, customer demand for products and services across IS&T's portfolio remained robust. The group's year-end backlog was $9.6 billion. This backlog does not include $22.4 billion of estimated

potential contract value comprising unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) awards which generally convert to backlog over time. Together, backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled nearly $32 billion at the end of 2011, up 28 percent from year-end 2010. At nearly three times 2011 sales, this represents an excellent opportunity set. We added several businesses to IS&T in 2011 which broaden and enhance our tactical communications and IT service offerings in faster-growing market segments. IS&T's opportunity pipeline is larger than ever as our portfolio remains well-aligned with customer spending priorities focused on cyber security, enhanced ISR, battlefield communications, health IT and streamlined, more cost-effective IT infrastructure. Capital Deployment General Dynamics' leaders remain focused on maximizing profitability and efficiently converting earnings to cash. We have maintained a balanced approach to deploying this capital by fulfilling our financial obligations, returning cash to shareholders and investing in the future. In 2011, we spent $1.6 billion to acquire six businesses that enhance the outlook for each of our three defense segments and $1 billion in product development and capital expenditures, to include the significant multi-year facilities project at Gulfstream. In July, we took advantage of favorable market conditions to issue $1.5 billion in new debt. This issuance increased the average maturity of our debt, reduced our average coupon rate, and covered repayment of $750 million of maturing notes while providing additional flexibility for future capital deployment. While the performance of our stock fell short of our expectations, we took advantage of that market reality to repurchase 20 million shares in 2011. And, in keeping with our board's commitment to long-term investors, we provided $673 million in dividend payments. Through these dividends and share repurchases, we returned over three-quarters of free cash to shareholders. Based on our solid financial position, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly

dividend 8.5 percent to $0.51, the 15th increase in as many years. The combination of our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook afford us the flexibility to continue to invest in our business, enhance our financial performance and return value to shareholders through the disciplined deployment of capital. In Closing As we look to the year ahead, our Aerospace business is poised to continue along a significant growth trajectory. The entry into service of our new G650 and G280 aircraft later this year marks the beginning of the next generation of Gulfstream aircraft. Meanwhile, as political leaders work to improve this country's financial foundation through more stringent spending regimes, the future of defense spending remains uncertain. The reality of today's threat environment mandates a strong military and a viable defense industrial base. We will continue to aggressively manage our valuable and resilient defense franchise to ensure its long-term success for the benefit of our customers, our employees and our shareholders. Finally, I am pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has elected Phebe N. Novakovic to be president and chief operating officer of the corporation, reporting to me, effective May 2. Phebe has been with General Dynamics since 2001, and has been executive vice president of Marine Systems since 2010. She has performed well in that role and is ready to assume a greater leadership position in the corporation. The resolve and determination of this team is among the many strengths of General Dynamics. Our leaders are seasoned in the intricacies of the markets we serve. Together, we face a future that, although challenging, offers great opportunity for our company and significant value for our fellow shareholders.
