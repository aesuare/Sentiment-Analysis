Letter to Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholders: 2012 was a year of significant progress for Avery Dennison, as we improved our financial performance and delivered a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. For the year, we delivered double-digit growth in earnings per share, reflecting a strong performance by the Pressuresensitive Materials businesses, solid progress in Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS), the early results of our restructuring program, and accretion from share repurchases. Once again, we generated strong free cash flow, which we used to meet our commitment to return more cash to you by repurchasing 7.9 million shares, or 7 percent, of our outstanding common stock, and paying a higher dividend.

These results reflect the excellent work of our employees. We increased sales by strengthening relationships with customers, improving service and product quality, and launching a significant number of innovative and sustainable new products. At the same time, we continued to make our operations more efficient, productive and reliable, and maintained the rigorous capital discipline required to generate strong free cash flow. We accomplished all of this in the midst of a great deal of change and economic uncertainty, and I thank all the members of our global team for their contributions. We are committed to delivering comparable results for the next several years. Last year we announced targets for 2012-2015 sales and earnings growth and free cash flow (available in our March 2013 investor presentation at www.investors.averydennison.com), and made changes to our portfolio and organization to ensure that we meet them.

The most visible portfolio change is the pending sale of Office and Consumer Products (OCP), which we expect to complete in mid-2013. After the termination of the OCP sale agreement with 3M Company last October, we quickly reached a new agreement with CCL Industries Inc., under which CCL would also acquire Designed and Engineered Solutions (DES), our specialty converting business. With anticipated net proceeds of approximately $400 million, we believe the transaction maximizes the value of OCP and DES for our shareholders. The sale will allow us to focus the company on our core businesses, Pressure-sensitive Materials and RBIS. We also implemented a comprehensive re-organization of our businesses to accelerate our earnings trajectory and ensure that we meet our financial targets even in adverse economic conditions. The reorganization includes:  Integrating the Graphics and Reflective Solutions business into Label and Packaging Materials, forming the Materials Group;  Moving the radio-frequency identification (RFID) inlay manufacturing division into RBIS;  Accelerating the reconfiguration and reduction of the RBIS manufacturing footprint; and  Transferring accountability for previously centralized support functions into the businesses and streamlining the corporate organization. We expect this program to yield more than $100 million in annualized savings by mid-2013. Equally important, the changes move resources and decision-making to the businesses and closer to customers, enhancing our already strong competitive advantages -- our global footprint and networks, size and economies of scale, leading positions in emerging markets, and innovation capabilities. We started to see benefits from these actions last year. One example is the integration of the RFID division into RBIS. As part of RBIS, the RFID team is now able to concentrate on its biggest opportunity -- apparel applications -- and

work much more closely with the retail brand owners who purchase our inventory management solutions. As a result, the team was able to increase RFID sales to apparel retailers more than 70 percent over 2011, dramatically improve operating efficiency, and make RFID a solidly profitable line of business. Accelerating Sales Growth Our target for organic sales growth is higher than the projected growth rates for our end markets. We believe we can accelerate sales by increasing market share through our industry-leading quality and service, leadership in faster-growing emerging markets and innovation, and investments in marketing and sales. We are building deeper relationships with customers and the end users who enhance their brands and make their supply chains more "intelligent" with our products and solutions. We have richer dialogues with our partners, giving us greater insights into their present concerns and future plans, which we translate into opportunities for growth. Last year, these relationships helped us gain market share in label and packaging materials in all regions, including economically challenged Europe. Likewise, RBIS delivered a strong second half of the year, driven in part by higher sales of core products. We continue to enhance our innovation capabilities. The Materials Group has launched more than 30 new products in the last two years and in 2012 exceeded its target for new product sales. Materials also used customer feedback to develop numerous "core" innovations -- incremental improvements in existing products and manufacturing processes. RBIS increased sales of its new external embellishments more than 20 percent in addition to its success with RFID. Vancive Medical Technologies, our medical solutions business, developed several new products in close consultation with partners and healthcare providers. Collaboration is also central to our sustainability efforts. In addition to making our operations more sustainable, we are working at the industry level as well as with customers to develop more sustainable products and processes. Last year we became the first supplier of apparel branding and information solutions to join

the Sustainable Apparel Coalition, the leading industry group working to reduce the environmental and social impacts of the apparel and footwear industries. In the same spirit, we worked with the Rainforest Alliance to develop a new company-wide policy on responsible paper sourcing. Sustainability is now an integral part of our innovation process. Virtually all of the products we launched last year are "greener" than their predecessors, and our new B2B ("bottle to bottle") portfolio of label materials, which makes it easier to recycle PET (polyethlene terephthalate) containers, has earned numerous industry awards. Increasing Earnings Growth We believe we can increase earnings faster than sales. The savings from our restructuring program will contribute, but a key reason for our confidence is our day-to-day culture of productivity. With operations based on Enterprise Lean Sigma, and our superb supply chain and sourcing teams, we consistently increase our operating efficiency while improving service quality and reliability. Our disciplined management of working capital contributes to the strong free cash flow that enables us to both invest in our businesses and return a substantial amount of cash to shareholders. Transitions This April will mark Director Peter Mullin's final annual meeting of shareholders, after which he will retire from the board. For 25 years, Peter has ably provided guidance to the board on financial and strategic matters, and I wish him the very best. Two new directors bring distinct experience and perspectives that will help the board guide the company into the future. Anthony Anderson, retired vice chair and managing partner of Ernst & Young LLP, brings financial expertise and experience advising multinational businesses. Martha Sullivan, president and CEO of Sensata Technologies Holding N.V., is an experienced engineer and business leader whose expertise in sensors and controls will prove invaluable as we advance the use of RFID and other information technologies.

Building momentum We accomplished a great deal in 2012. With the portfolio and organization changes we executed, we have positioned the company to accelerate sales growth, increase earnings faster than sales, and generate strong free cash flow. While we're pleased with the progress we've made so far, we know we have more to do. In 2013, we intend to build on our momentum and continue to deliver results.
