From the Chairman
Fellow shareholders,

AT MARATHON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, WE LOOK BACK ON 2015 WITH THE SAME SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT AS WE HAVE EACH YEAR SINCE 2011, WHEN WE BECAME AN INDEPENDENT COMPANY. IT WAS ANOTHER YEAR IN WHICH WE ENHANCED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SOLID LONGTERM RETURNS TO OUR OWNERS. IT WAS ANOTHER YEAR IN WHICH WE POSITIONED OURSELVES TO HELP MEET THE NATION'S AND THE WORLD'S ENERGY NEEDS WELL INTO THE FUTURE.
Our dual focus on capital returns to shareholders and investing strategically in the company's growth has yielded excellent results. During the year, we returned $1.6 billion to our owners. We intend to continue a disciplined approach to resource allocation and capital returns in 2016 and beyond. We have continued to execute on our commitment to grow the stable earnings from MPC's retail and midstream businesses while simultaneously improving margins in our refining and marketing segment. We have accomplished this not just through strategic transactions, but also through our ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions into our structure. We have implemented this transformative process repeatedly across our value chain. We created MPLX LP as a midstream master limited partnership, which benefits MPC shareholders through MPC's ownership interest in MPLX's general partner. We acquired the Galveston Bay refinery, significantly increasing our refining capacity in the geographically critical U.S. Gulf Coast region. We almost doubled Speedway's marketing footprint and have made tremendous progress converting the new stores to the Speedway brand. And MPLX's acquisition of MarkWest Energy Partners, L.P. expands MPLX into the midstream natural gas business. These strategic transactions have increased our scale and diversified our geography and operations. They make us a stronger company and a better investment. MPC has been in the energy business for almost 130 years, and we have a long memory of what it takes to succeed. As we continue to strengthen our long-term value proposition in the world's energy market, we thank you for sharing in our vision, and for contributing to our success. Sincerely,

Thomas J. Usher Chairman
