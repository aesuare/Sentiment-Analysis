                 to our stockholders
 If a single word can be used to sum up 2010, it would be this: Progress.
After so many challenging months, the
year began with hopeful signs of labor market stabilization and—finally—economic recovery. As 2010 unfolded, we struck a positive course, moving forward at a quickened pace, and with increased confidence.
The result? 2010 was a year in which Kelly returned to profitability.
groWing profits
Our earnings from operations for 2010 totaled $38.1 million, compared with a loss of $146.1 million in 2009. Included in this year’s results were $7.2 million of restructuring charges. For the year, we increased revenue by 15 percent. Earnings from continuing operations were $0.71 per share, against 2009 losses of $3.01 per share. Taken together, restructuring charges totaled $0.15 per share in 2010. Most significantly, we held costs in check and maintained stable margins.
While the economic rebound certainly helped, there is no doubt that the restructuring we completed in 2009 set the stage, fueled our performance, and boosted our momentum.
energizing our Company
As you remember, during the recession we reassessed nearly everything about our company. We reshaped the organization, refined our strategy, and sharpened our focus. Across every business segment, throughout every region, we took decisive steps to streamline operations.
With that difficult but necessary process behind us, we entered 2010 a leaner, more agile organization.
Strengthened by renewed goals, a refreshed strategic plan, and a reduced footprint aligned with new market realities, Kelly emerged as an energized company, poised to deliver competitive returns.

a recharged strategic plan in place, we’re poised to deliver competitive returns.
innovative supplier networks that can be scaled to
     supplying WorkforCe solutions
Trends are with us: GDP is picking up, global markets are accelerating, and employment growth is slowly following.
Yet a return to full employment may take several years. And, until hiring picks up and confidence is restored, this environment actually favors our industry.
After a prolonged recession, businesses have dramatically changed the way in which they operate. Seeking greater flexibility, they are turning to new workforce models that engage free agents and contingent employees. At the same time, they face a global talent deficit.
Kelly is in an excellent position to apply our expertise and leverage our experience to capitalize on this new customer demand.
targeting our sigHts
With the global economic recovery underway, 2011 provides the opportunity for increased focus on professional/technical staffing, fee-based services, and customized outsourcing. And our strategic initiatives set the foundation for aggressive growth in these higher-margin specialty businesses.
We have now substantially completed the global infrastructure for Kelly Outsourcing and Consulting Group. Designed to respond to complex customer needs, KellyOCG is the platform for delivering a wide range of services that help customers manage their workforce and maintain their suppliers across multiple disciplines—and multiple geographies.
To date, Kelly has already won several significant global contracts through KellyOCG, which is key to our future success. At the same time, we are witnessing growth in all our business segments, retaining accounts, and earning high marks in customer satisfaction.
engaging exCeptional talent
Even the smartest business plans don’t execute themselves. It all comes down to talent. The current landscape offers a paradox: persistent unemployment coupled with unmet demand.
Kelly is well prepared to provide our customers access to hard-to-find, high-caliber talent. We are aggressively growing our pipelines and building
serve local or global operations.
At the center of these networks is our team of
internal experts—engaged, passionate professionals who deliver customer-focused solutions with a commitment to service excellence.
moving aHead
As we reflect on our structural changes and the progress we’ve made in the past year, we are confident that Kelly is ready to meet the labor market demands that lie ahead.
We are committed to returning a competitive profit by:
• Emphasizing higher-margin specialty staffing, expanding fee-based businesses, and building on our reputation for excellent service to broaden customer relationships
• Delivering customer-focused workforce solutions across a wide spectrum of services; and
• Engaging the best talent by attracting and retaining an exceptional team of employees, free agents, and suppliers
I want to thank our stockholders for the confidence you have placed in us, and our directors for their steady guidance. I’m especially grateful to all our employees for their efforts during the year. They did
an exceptional job of upholding customer service, controlling expenses, and working smart to help us deliver solid results. All of us are proud to be part of the Kelly team, and eager to succeed together.
