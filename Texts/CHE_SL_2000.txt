S h a r e h o l d e r s
We are keeping our promise to focus on growth. Rather than paying a high dividend, we are invest- ing in Chemed’s core businesses and executing our strategy to become the premier provider of services to home owners and businesses. As a result, your company is gaining recognition in the financial world.

Service revenues and sales grew to $500.7 million, up 10% over 1999’s $453.6 million.

 products by technicians to customers. Service America, Chemed’s
provider of major-appliance and
HVAC service, increased revenues
17% in its retail sales and service busi-
ness in 2000. This growth was offset
by a planned reduction in contract
sales due to the elimination of unprof-
itable contracts from its customer
base. Thus, total revenues of $74.2
million in 2000 were essentially even
with 1999 revenues. During 2000,
Service America was impacted by rap-
system, coupled with the ever-growing demand for homecare services.
IN MEMORIAM
On a personal note, Chemed mourns the loss of three longtime asso- ciates in 2000. Director Emeritus Herman B Wells, chancellor of Indiana University, passed away in March, and Director Emeritus Neal Gilliatt, retired vice chairman of The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc., died unexpectedly in September. Finally, we were saddened by the untimely death of former Roto-Rooter President and CEO William R. Griffin on December 13. We extend our sym- pathy to their families.
OUTLOOK
It is a great pleasure to report to you Chemed’s results for 2000. We accom- plished excellent growth in our major
operating business, Roto-Rooter. Roto-Rooter and Service America pro- vide essential repair services to our principal residential and commercial markets. Patient Care serves a critical need for high-quality home health care. We believe the best way to build shareholder value is to focus on our repair service businesses, particularly Roto-Rooter, as you will read in the next sections of this report. With Chemed approaching its 30th anniver- sary as a public company, we see a bright future ahead.

Patient Care Inc. generated $137.1 million in revenues in 2000, up 6% over 1999 revenues. This revenue increase was achieved at a time when many home health agencies saw declining revenues as a result of Medicare’s interim payment system. This system, in place since 1997, has caused many providers to exit the industry, as they were unable to oper- ate profitably. Patient Care, in spite of these difficult conditions, earned $2.1 million in 2000. Going forward, Patient Care expects to benefit from a new, more favorable reimbursement
with the planned reduction in con-
tract revenues and investments in crit-
ical infrastructure, restricted earnings. Even so, Service America is on target to generate sustained income growth in the years ahead.
