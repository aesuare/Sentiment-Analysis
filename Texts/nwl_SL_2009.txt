The year 2009 was extraordinary in many ways: extraordinary for the depth and breadth of its economic challenges, and extraordinary for the way our employees at Newell Rubbermaid responded to it. Despite the challenges, we delivered what we promised. We achieved our financial goals, we made meaningful progress on the execution of our strategic transformations and we demonstrated that our brands can grow market share in a down economy – all requisites for being the best-in-class company to which we aspire. Our vision to become a global company of Brands That MatterTM and great people, known for best-in-class results, is becoming reality. Throughout Newell Rubbermaid today are examples of real transformations that are delivering results. Given our journey of recent years – and the challenging economic hurdles of the last 12 months – I could not be more proud of “Brand NWL.”
  
SOLID PERFORMANCE
We began 2009 in a rapidly declining sales environment on the heels of the global economic meltdown that began in late 2008. Our financial priorities were clear: protect earnings and maxi- mize cash flow, despite pressures from inevitable revenue declines. Even more importantly, we were determined to preserve investments in new product innovation and consumer understanding to keep the momentum we had worked so hard to establish in our strategic brand-building initiatives. Our organization achieved this ambitious agenda and more.
• Normalized earnings grew by 8 percent from $1.21 to $1.31 per share.
• Gross margin expanded by 390 basis points to 36.7 percent of sales, putting us well within reach of our 40 percent gross margin target over the next few years.
• Operating cash flow increased by 33 percent year-over-year to $603 million, restoring our cash generation to pre-recession levels.
An emphasis on working capital discipline, rigorous inventory management and disciplined cost control also contributed significantly to this performance. We eliminated almost $130 million in SG&A expense during the year and preserved a healthy level of brand-building investment as a percentage of sales. The emphasis on main- taining our new product pipeline will serve us especially well as we set our sights on renewed growth in a recovering marketplace.
AN OPTIMIZED PORTFOLIO
The Company’s financial and operational achievements in 2009 speak to the tremendous progress made in recent years to achieve best costs through manufacturing and sourcing rationalization, as well as sharing services and best practices. Without these enterprise-wide efficiency and productivity enhancements
to support our brands, I would be less upbeat about our progress.
Our 2009 performance also demonstrated the strength of the Newell Rubbermaid brand portfolio. The decision to exit $500 million in sales of low-margin, commoditized product categories in the Office Products and Rubbermaid Consumer businesses was critical to our improved results. We now have a portfolio of core platforms that are responsive to consumer understanding, product innovation and brand marketing. This
was demonstrated in 2009 when despite declines ranging from 5 to 25 percent in our end-user markets, about two-thirds of our businesses achieved market share gains.
With a product portfolio centered upon everyday necessities such as food preparation and storage, baby care and hair styling, our Home & Family segment proved to be the most resilient among our businesses in 2009. This segment experienced a low-single-digit decline in core sales for the full year, with a return to core sales growth in the fourth quarter. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segment was particularly challenged due to sustained weakness in the housing, industrial and commercial markets. As a result, this segment reported a mid-teens-percentage decrease in core sales. Serving both retail and commercial consumers, the Office Products segment’s core sales fell mid-single digits, in line with the overall Company performance. The good news is that all three operating segments showed sequential improvement in sales trends in the fourth quarter, which we believe to be a leading indicator of a return to growth in 2010.
BRAND BUILDING SUCCESS
Though these financial results tell the story of the past year, they do not fully impart the progress that has been made within our business units in recent years and the potential that lies ahead. While work remains, we can increasingly see a distinct cause and effect between brand-building excellence and share gains in our portfolio.

The team at Rubbermaid Food Storage, for example, has done an outstanding job of put- ting the brand-building process to work. Using consumer research, they identified container and lid organization as the number one unmet need with food storage containers. This insight led to a solution in the form of an innovative new product – Easy Find LidsTM. Rubbermaid Food Storage then commercialized the new product by investing in advertising and market- ing that resonated with their target consumers. A commercial for Rubbermaid Easy Find LidsTM was rated the most effective TV spot of 2009.
Our Sharpie® brand has a similar story. Innovative new products, such as the Sharpie® pen, and integrated marketing campaigns have propelled Sharpie® from the largest marker brand to the largest writing brand in North America today. The success of the Sharpie® brand reflects the strategy of our Office Prod- ucts segment to focus its portfolio around four leading global brands – Paper Mate®, Sharpie®, Parker® and Dymo® – in order to leverage supply chain management, product innovation and marketing investments on a global basis. As part of this effort, we are consolidating our regional everyday writing brands under the Paper Mate® brand. We recently unveiled a new logo and will introduce new global packaging later this year.
In our Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segment, Rubbermaid Commercial Products continues to set the standard in the commercial facilities cleaning and maintenance market. Our 2008 addition of Technical Concepts (TC) to this business has proven to be an excellent example of how strategic acquisitions can enhance our portfolio. As a leading provider of touch-free hygiene, skincare and aircare solutions, TC grew 25 percent in 2009, largely due to heightened demand for its hand sanitizer and hand cleaner dispensing products.
Though the Tools, Hardware & Commercial Products segment continues to battle market cyclicality, our brands are outperforming many peers and gaining market share in key catego- ries and channels. This team worked hard to improve the cost structure, and the segment is now well positioned for sales growth as indus- trial and construction markets recover.
PRIMED FOR PERFORMANCE
These are but a few of many examples that demonstrate the meaningful progress we have made over the past year despite a challenging economic environment. Newell Rubbermaid is a stronger organization and better competitor for having proven it can deliver under adverse circumstances. Indeed, the Company is in an excellent position to perform well going for- ward, with a more streamlined cost structure, significantly improved margins and a portfolio responsive to innovation and brand building.
As 2010 begins to unfold, we have seen a degree of stability return to the marketplace. While the rate of recovery will vary across our businesses, we expect a modest level of sales growth this year as we continue to grow share in what is likely to be a flat to slightly positive economy. Consumers are seeking value more than ever, and our emphasis on best costs combined with innovative solutions provides all of our business units with a compelling go-to-market proposition.
In last year’s letter to you, I expressed my confidence in our ability to weather the economic crisis and achieve our goals because of my trust and high regard for the men and women of Newell Rubbermaid. This year, I give them all the credit for rising to the challenge and doing an admirable job on behalf of our consumers, customers and shareholders. This team is the essence of Brand NWL, and their potential to create value is just beginning to emerge.
Sincerely,
  ..................MARK D. KETCHUM...........................................................................
