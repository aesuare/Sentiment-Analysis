 A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, AND VENDORS
YEAR 2002
Year 2002 was another difficult year for the entire electronics industry.Vishay, like other electronic component manufactur- ers, faced problems related to market demand, inventory, pric- ing, and other factors. Nevertheless, despite the ongoing industry-wide downturn,Vishay continued to generate cash, increase market penetration, and make strategic acquisitions.
As stated in last year’s Annual Report, “We will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities to facilitate the growth of our business and to strengthen our position in the markets we serve.This is consistent withVishay’s historic ability to maintain a competitive edge throughout economic cycles. In the year 2002 and beyond, we will continue to build on our position as a leader in the U.S., European, and Asian electronics markets.”
In this light, in December 2002 Vishay completed its acquisi- tion of BCcomponents Holdings B.V., a leading manufacturer of passive components with a strong market position in Europe and Asia. Its product lines complement Vishay’s passive component product lines and include additional products, such as miniature aluminum capacitors, thermistors of the PTC type, and varistors.The acquisition also provided passive component manufacturing plants in China and India.These plants, our first ones for passive components in China and India, will strengthen considerably our market position in Asia by making Vishay more cost-competitive and bringing us clos- er to our customers in Asia.Vishay already has had, for several years, discrete semiconductor manufacturing facilities in Asia, with plants in China,Taiwan, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Now we also have plants in Asia for passive components.
We are very excited about the opportunities presented by the BCcomponents acquisition, which, barring extraordinary events, should add approximately $250 million in sales during year 2003.
During 2002,Vishay also expanded into the measurement and weighing markets by making a series of small acquisitions: Sensortronics (in January 2002),Tedea-Huntleigh (in June 2002), the BLH and Nobel businesses of Thermo Electron Corporation (in July 2002), and Celtron Technologies (in October 2002). Our Vishay Measurements Group unit already was the world’s largest manufacturer of strain gages, which are sold into the global transducers market.With these
acquisitions, which are being consolidated into Vishay Measurements Group, we have implemented a strategy of ver- tical market integration.Vishay now manufactures and markets strain gages (which are used in transducers), the transducers themselves (metallic structures to which strain gages are cemented), and the electronic instruments and systems that use transducers to measure and control output.
The global market for transducers, instruments, and systems that measure the output of transducers is estimated to be over $1.5 billion [Company estimate]. Because this market is relatively fragmented, and because Vishay is now a vertically integrated player in it,Vishay is well positioned to increase market share.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
For the year ended December 31, 2002, sales were $1,822,813,000 compared to sales of $1,655,346,000 in the previous year, an increase of 10%. Before restructuring charges and other unusual items of $169,800,000, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $43,489,000 or $0.27 per share as compared to net earnings of $119,289,000 or $0.84 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2001. After the restructuring charges and other non-recurring items of $169,800,000, the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $(92,614,000) or $(0.58) per share. Non-recurring items incurred during 2002 include a write-down of current inventory of tantalum and a pre-tax loss on long-term pur- chase commitments for tantalum in excess of market price in the amount of $106,000,000.
Cash generation is critical, especially during difficult times.The Company continued to generate cash from operations during year 2002. In fact, for the year ended December 31, 2002,
the Company’s cash flow from operations was $366,871,000. Purchases of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $110,074,000.
The long-term debt of the Company was $706,316,000 at December 31, 2002 and the stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2002 was $2,358,787,000 resulting in a debt to equity ratio of 0.30. Our cash balance at December 31, 2002 was $339,938,000.
LOOKING AHEAD
We expect our cash generation to continue during 2003 and beyond, giving us the ability to make acquisitions. Revenues from our specialty products help to offset the impact of price

 erosion for many of our commodity products. Our broad product line and global footprint allow us to be a one-stop shop for discrete semiconductors and passive components, from single-source and specialty components to commodity products.
The ongoing industry-wide downturn has a positive side, as it lowers the cost toVishay of potential acquisition targets.We acquired the former Infineon infrared components group and General Semiconductor in 2001, and successfully integrated them with our former Vishay Telefunken operations into the newVishay Semiconductors unit in 2002.These acquisitions contributed strongly to our cash generation in the last year. We acquired BCcomponents at the end of 2002 and anticipate immediate cost savings and increased revenues during 2003. Also, I expect that the integration of the recently acquired transducer companies into Vishay Measurements Group will increase our revenues and earnings, and will provide an addi- tional avenue of growth.
Another area where Vishay’s growth during 2002 set the stage for future growth is Asia. During 2002,Vishay’s revenues in Asia increased to 38% of our total global revenues.We expect our growth in Asian sales to continue during year 2003 and beyond, as Asia, particularly China, assumes an increasingly important role in the global electronics industry — not just in manufacturing, but in product design and development as well. Our acquisition of BCcomponents during 2002 — like our acquisitions of General Semiconductor (2001), the Infineon infrared components group (2001),Telefunken and 80.4% of Siliconix (1998), and the transducer companies Celtron and Tedea-Huntleigh (2002) — brought with it manufacturing and sales locations in Asia.Vishay’s ongoing penetration of the Asian market involves close cooperation with local and regional sales channel partners in mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, India, and elsewhere.
In March 2003, Marc Zandman was named Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors of Vishay, along with existing Vice Chairman Avi Eden.While I have no current plans for retire- ment, in a company with the size, worldwide presence, and technological sophistication of Vishay, it is prudent to plan for the future. I believe that the present management team of Avi Eden, Gerald Paul, Richard Grubb, and Marc Zandman assures the Company of having the strong strategic and operational direction it will need in the future.The appointment of Marc as Vice Chairman will now provide for an orderly succession of experienced leadership at the top, with Avi assuming the
Chairmanship, depending on the timing of my retirement, and Marc following thereafter.
During year 2003, as in
the past,Vishay will con-
tinue to develop and
introduce new manufac-
turing techniques, prod-
ucts, technologies, and
packaging methods. In
2002, our Siliconix unit introduced 127 new products and achieved 857 new design-wins with customers. Our other semiconductor unit (Vishay Semiconductors) and our passive component units also introduced many new products and achieved design-wins, thus ensuring that Vishay components will be used in new generations of end products such as laptop computers, automotive subsystems, computer game systems, home appliances, televisions, and many other end products. Vishay, with over four decades of technology leadership, remains firmly committed to product innovation.
When the electronics industry recovers from the current downturn,Vishay will be well positioned for enhanced growth. Meanwhile, and without having to wait for the upturn,Vishay will do what we have done during all economic cycles, both good and bad: roll out new and innovative products, generate cash, explore opportunities for strategic acquisitions, maintain our focus on cost reduction, and strengthen our relationships with customers and strategic partners.
We are very grateful to our employees, customers, and suppli- ers, all of whom worked very hard to meet the challenges of 2002.To our stockholders, thank you sincerely for your confi- dence in Vishay during the past year, a difficult one for the entire electronics industry.We look forward to renewed growth and new accomplishments during 2003 and beyond.
Sincerely,
Felix Zandman
