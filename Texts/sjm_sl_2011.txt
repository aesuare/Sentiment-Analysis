Dear Shareholders and Friends:
our family – all 4,500 of us at The J. M. Smucker company – is pleased to share a successful year of accomplishments with you. Fiscal 2011 delivered impressive results and performance despite the challenging economic environment. These results prove that when a dedicated team is focused on Our Purpose – bringing families together to share memorable meals and moments – and implementing a clear strategy, strong financial results and enhanced shareholder value will follow:
• Sales grew to $4.8 billion, an increase of five percent over last year, due to strong performance across many of the brands in our portfolio.
• The strength of our brands and our ability to manage successfully through a volatile commodity cost environment resulted in a seven percent increase in non-Gaap earnings per share to $4.69.
• We repurchased approximately 5.7 million common shares that represented over four percent of shares outstanding. We also increased our dividends paid to shareholders by 17 percent.
continuous investment in our company has resulted in a portfolio of iconic brands, the majority of which hold category-leading market positions. This leadership reflects our long-held philosophy of delivering great products at a fair value. We believe value is as much about quality, consistency, and trust as it is about price.
This past fiscal year, our brands have delivered this
type of value in numerous ways with impressive results:
• new product innovation contributed significantly to the company’s growth, particularly within our coffee, peanut butter, and baking brands.
• our consumer communications efforts continued to drive brand equity, and we continued to be the primary share-of-voice for most of our categories. as a result, we produced an unprecedented number of television and broadband video advertisements during the year.
• We dramatically increased our digital marketing and social media programs, which now comprise over 10 percent of our company’s media spend.
We are particularly proud that our communication efforts continue to be executed in an effective and family- friendly manner. The parents Television council has honored Smucker with the #1 ranking on its “Top Ten
Best advertisers” list recognizing companies that advertise only on responsibly produced entertainment programs.

as an independent company with a history of leadership continuity, we are able to manage our business with a long-term perspective. our unique culture, combined with this long-term perspective, has enabled us to deliver consistently strong financial results. on a 10-year basis, our total shareholder return has outpaced the average of the Standard & poor’s packaged foods industry, as well as those of broader market indexes.
We remain committed to preserving our Independence and ensuring leadership continuity because both have been significant contributors to our culture, financial performance, and ability to serve our business and constituents – consumers, customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and shareholders.
accordingly, throughout our history, we have proactively planned for leadership succession. as part of this process, several executive appointments and realignments became effective on May 1, 2011, the start of our 2012 fiscal year.
