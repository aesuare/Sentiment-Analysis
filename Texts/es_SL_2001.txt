Dear Fellow

Shareowner

Stronger, brighter and a sharp focus on delivering results--I believe these words best describe Northeast Utilities as we enter the second year of the new century. 2001 was a year in which we accomplished most of what we set out to do. Revenues topped the $6.8 billion mark, and we now serve nearly two million retail electric and gas customers in an 11 state region. We successfully met a number of our long-term goals-- including the sale of Millstone Station for a record price, the issuance of $2.1 billion of rate reduction bonds on behalf of our three regulated electric companies, and the introduction of industry restructuring in New Hampshire. At $243.5 million, reported earnings were the best we have recorded since 1995, supported greatly by a $115.6 million gain from the sale of Millstone Station. In those few areas where we did not achieve our targets, we consistently improved performance and set the stage for substantial growth in coming years. NU has never been financially stronger. Our balance sheet improvements resulted in multiple rounds of credit upgrades, ending the year at the highest levels in decades. Our capitalization ratios were significantly stronger at the end of 2001 than a year earlier. Our current ratio--52 percent debt, two percent preferred stock and 46 percent common equity--is among the best in our history. Additionally, we refinanced more than $1.7 billion of debt and credit lines, generally all with more favorable terms. All of these moves give us a high level of financial strength and flexibility to fund our future growth. And, that future is bright. Our key regulated businesses--Connecticut Light & Power (CL&P) and Y ankee Gas as well as Public Service of New Hampshire (PSNH) and Western Massachusetts

Electric (WMECO)--are now positioned for growth. We are pushing hard into the arena of interstate transmission, and we believe this will be an important opportunity for us to expand our regulated earnings base and fulfill our obligations to serve all of our customers as cost effectively as we can. Our competitive businesses are hitting their top line revenue targets for growth, although they do need to deliver improved profitability. Absolute earnings of our regulated businesses were down in 2001 due to the sale of Millstone early in the year and the resulting loss of wholesale revenues. Earnings before preferred dividends for CL&P fell to $109.8 million from $148.1 million in 2000. Results at PSNH and North Atlantic Energy Company (NAEC) declined as a result of implementation of industry restructuring and an 11 percent reduction of retail rates. While the combined earnings before preferred dividends of PSNH and NAEC totaled $86 million in 2001, compared to $100 million the previous year, we were able to use the proceeds of restructuring to buy back 10 percent of our common shares in 2001. Results at NU's competitive businesses showed significant gains in revenue growth, but yielded lower earnings. Revenues reached $3 billion in 2001 and delivered earnings of $5 million compared to revenues of $1.9 billion and a contribution towards NU's consolidated earnings of $13.6 million in 2000. Management will be keenly focused in 2002 on improving the bottom line at those businesses as revenues continue to grow. Many aspects of our performance at Select Energy

has been steadily improving with the exception of one underperforming contract --standard offer service for electric customers in Connecticut. More than two years after restructuring, competition has yet to develop in Connecticut --due primarily to the below-market standard offer rates. To stimulate development of this competitive marketplace, we asked regulators to consider a one-cent increase in customers' energy rates. Although they rejected our initial request, the state Department of Public Utility Control (DPUC) has opened hearings into the "state of competition" and we are optimistic that this issue will be addressed this year. Partially offsetting the decreased regulated electric earnings discussed above was a significant increase in earnings at Y ankee Gas, which NU acquired in March. Y ankee earned $25.8 million in 2001, compared to a loss of $700,000 in 2000. Additionally, NU repurchased some 14.3 million shares in 2001 and is authorized to purchase another 11 million in 2002 and 2003. In 2001, the repurchases added $0.06 per share and should add several additional cents per share in 2002. Our return on investment is at a predictable and stable level. When we add in the dividend, total return to shareholders' growth over the past four years has averaged approximately 13 percent on an annualized basis. Our dividend will continue to grow as our regulated businesses grow and expand. We anticipate continued 10 percent annual growth, up to 50 percent of regulated earnings. A major disappointment for shareholders this year was ConEd's refusal to proceed in accordance with the terms of the merger contract that had been approved by shareholders of both companies and by almost every regulatory body that had reviewed it. The 27

percent reduction in NU's share price in 2001 was painful, even though the Dow Jones and Standard and Poors utility indices fell by more. We are determined to restore that lost value both through growing the earnings of the company and by recovering fair compensation for our shareholders from ConEd. I expect a trial to begin in federal court later this year. One of our greatest strengths is our focus --both on strategy and on delivering results. We have adopted a balanced approach to growth, concentrating on what we do well and not trying to be all things in all markets. Our future lies principally in an 11 state geographic region with specific businesses related to the delivery and marketing of energy. Our vision --set several years ago--is to be the leading energy delivery and marketing company in the Northeast region. The fact that we continue to deliver on that strategy today is a testament to the strength of this vision and that of our management and employee team. As we move forward with our plans, you will see the focus I mentioned across all of our businesses. To better leverage our resources and streamline our operations, we made some significant organizational and management changes this year. We created the Utility Group, comprising our regulated operating companies. Working together, our regulated energy delivery companies are now better positioned to capitalize on each other's best practices. To meet the need for long haul energy delivery infrastructure expansion, our Transmission Business unit was created and launched one of the most ambitious expansion plans in our company's history.

are seeking approvals for transmission projects totaling nearly $1 billion. When approved, these projects will alleviate serious transmission congestion problems in the Northeast region, improve the regional energy delivery infrastructure and promote access to less costly power for customers. Our expansion plans also extend to our Y ankee Gas distribution system. As part of this organic growth, more than 70 miles of new gas mains and services were installed during the second half of 2001 throughout Connecticut at a cost of $23 million. Another $170 million of projects are expected over the next several years. Completion of this expansion will extend greater fuel diversity to Connecticut consumers by offering another energy choice. Our proposed construction of a liquefied natural gas plant would give us greater control over and diversity for our gas supply, and deliver a more stable supply and lower prices for customers. Our plans for expanding the distribution system were approved in January 2002 by Connecticut regulators. In our competitive businesses, Select Energy is maturing as its revenue growth continues in spite of a challenging and often chaotic market. The acquisition of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing (now Select Energy New Y ork) bolsters our role in the region's energy marketing arena. In addition to Select Energy, our competitive businesses will continue to grow in the area of generation services. With further integration of profitable energy supply and services businesses into our competitive affiliates group, our unregulated rates of return will continue their year over year growth. This year we expect these businesses to contribute one-half of our revenues. We will continue our focus on responding to the market's needs rather than

trying to force our products into the market. We are not taking undue risks and we continue to realize success by staying within our regional approach. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly recognize four of our trustees who either retired or left the board to focus on their other business obligations in 2001. Bill Pape, Bill Conway, Emery Olcott and John Turner served the shareholders of Northeast Utilities with distinction during some very challenging times. Bill Pape was our most senior trustee with more than 27 years of dedicated service. Their thoughtful advice and wise counsel will be greatly missed. We thank them and wish them all the best. I am happy to report that Richard Booth, president of Hartford Steam Boiler Company and James F. Cordes, recently retired executive vice president, Natural Gas for The Coastal Corporation have joined the board. I already have seen significant input from these experienced executives and look forward to working with Richard and Jim. As we move through 2002, our talented senior management team and employees will remain focused on delivering results that you, our shareowners, deserve. We believe the future has never been brighter. We hope you will agree. Sincerely,

Michael G. Morris
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer March 1, 2002
