Dear Fellow Stockholders
James Verrier,
President and Chief Executive Officer
                     
 We are very proud to have delivered another year of strong performance in 2014. We began the year with a fresh perspective on our business, refining our vision, mission, and key strategies. In doing so, we gained greater clarity on the future of our company and reaffirmed our long-term growth target of becoming a $15 billion revenue company by 2020. Our operating results indicate that we also maintained our focus on effective execution. Notably, we led the industry in growth and profitability with revenue and EPS growth of approximately 12% and an operating income margin of nearly 13% in 2014.
Delivering on our promises
Our outstanding financial and operational results are truly a testament to the exceptional global BorgWarner team, who strives every day to unlock the inherent strength of our strategies and fulfill the company’s potential. Our recent efforts have driven some notable results, including:
In the first quarter of 2014, we completed the Wahler acquisition, which positions us well to exploit the rapid adoption of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems in gasoline engines.
We maintained R&D spending of just over 4% of net sales during the year, highlighting our commitment to organic innovation and product development.
We increased our quarterly cash dividend four percent, from $0.125 to $0.13 per share of common stock, building on our balanced capital allocation strategy.
The Drivetrain restructuring plan took a major step forward in July as we began moving equipment from Western Europe into Poland, enhancing Drivetrain’s competitiveness and ability to serve customer needs.
In September, we opened our second turbocharger production facility in China, a strategically located, environmentally efficient facility that will produce advanced turbocharging technologies for several automakers.
2014 was also another year of recognition for the innovation, collaboration, and excellence at BorgWarner:
We received the 2014 Automotive News PACE Innovation Partnership Award for our collaboration with General Motors
on the Eco-LaunchTM solenoid valve.We also received the 2014 Automotive News PACE Award applauding BorgWarner’s innovation.
BorgWarner supplied advanced technologies for a number of winners of the 2014 World Car Awards, including Audi A3 (World Car of the Year), Mercedes-Benz S-Class (World Luxury Car), and the Porsche 911 GT3 (World Performance Car).
BorgWarner Turbo Systems received the Automotive INNOVATIONS Award 2014 in Frankfurt, Germany for a variety of turbocharging technologies.
119 of our employees worldwide received BorgWarner Innovation Awards for operational excellence, product development, customer excellence and collaboration.
BorgWarner’s facilities in Frankfort, Illinois; Water Valley, Mississippi; and Ithaca, New York were awarded 2014 Supplier Quality Excellence Awards from General Motors.

BorgWarner’s manufacturing plant in Manesar, India was awarded a 2014 Supplier Quality Excellence Award from GM India for being a top-performing supplier.
When I stepped into this role more
than two years ago, I was committed
to putting our substantial free cash to use. I am pleased to report that we are delivering on that promise. In 2013,
we returned to stockholders 95% of
our free cash through dividends and share repurchases, and this past year we deployed nearly 150% of our free cash between our dividend program, share repurchases and a strategic acquisition. I am gratified by our recent achievements and will remain committed to creating economic value by optimizing our operational proficiency, increasing focus on capital efficiency, and prioritizing strong cash flow that will allow us to fund organic growth, pursue strategic acquisitions, and ultimately return cash to stockholders.

Producing consistent performance
At BorgWarner, we have a strong track record of consistent growth, consistent innovation in technology, and consistently delivering strong operating performance. Commitment to consistent performance
is ingrained in our culture and means we expect the company to remain a driving force in the industry for many years to come.
As anyone in our industry will confirm, margin expansion is difficult with product pricing pressure creating meaningful headwinds. While cost savings are the first line of defense against margin erosion, even well-run businesses must achieve strong sales growth to successfully expand or maintain margins. Our business model is based on highly engineered products, intellectual property, complex and capital-intensive manufacturing and high switching costs for our customers. These characteristics deter potential new entrants and provide a foundation for strong margins and sustained growth. In 2010, our operating income margin was
9.3% (excluding non-comparable items). Based on the continued determination
of our team, we have been able to achieve margins of nearly 13% (excluding non-comparable items) in 2014. We expect to maintain or expand our margins and we expect our annual incremental margins to be in the mid-teens for the foreseeable future.
Key factors in our ability to consistently grow faster than the market are our knowledge of macroeconomic trends and how we use this knowledge to predict and rapidly adapt to a constantly changing marketplace. In combination with the close partnerships we forge with our customers, our ability to predict and adapt to market trends is a hallmark of our success.
In close association with our review of macroeconomic trends is affirmation
of our strategy. Our research and deliberations have confirmed that we are focused on exactly the right segment of the industry: powertrain applications.

 Powertrainefficiencyispartofour heritage, synonymous with the name BorgWarner, and is as critical to the automotive world today as it has ever been. We take pride in our leading position
in powertrain technology, notably in downsizing and boosting, down-speeding, and emissions reduction, all of which continue to provide tremendous growth opportunities. Additionally, we have identified and studied other emerging trends that will provide opportunities for us to evolve and grow, as we have done throughout our history.
Moving from strength to strength
As we look into the future, it is clear that BorgWarner will be a supplier for all vehicle powertrain architectures, for light and commercial vehicles, and will develop
a broader scope of products for the continued evolution of internal combustion engines, electrification, thermal management, and drivetrain evolution. The portfolio of products required to serve each of these trends is a natural extension of, or is adjacent to, our current portfolio. Notably, we will be expanding our focus on electrification over the next decade. In fact, our portfolio already includes products specifically designed for electrification. Our Eco-LaunchTM solenoid valve, developed specifically for stop-start equipped vehicles, is already in production and our eBooster® electric turbocharger is slated to launch in 2017. These are just two examples of the many innovative technologies to come. We continue to develop and pursue the talent, skills and knowledge required to build a leadership position in electrification. We firmly believe that electrification, like boosting, variable cam timing, dual-clutch transmissions, all-wheel drive and all of the other growth drivers of our business, is another opportunity for BorgWarner to evolve and expand its reach across the powertrain.
The immense opportunities in powertrain provide us with confidence that our
goal of $15 billion in revenue by 2020 is very achievable. Our robust three-year backlog, which is driving organic growth

at a rate of 10% to 12%, highlights the progress we have already made. We feel very confident in the growth of the backlog itself as well as the increased breadth of demand across our evolving product portfolio.
Our geographic mix continues to evolve. In 2014, the breakdown of total net sales by geography was approximately 50%
in Europe, 22% in Asia and 28% in the Americas. As we move forward, we are working toward a more equally balanced portfolio with increased emphasis on Asia, which we expect will grow rapidly from 22% of our business in 2014 to 26% in 2015. While Europe remains an important leading market for the advancement in powertrain technology and a driver of growth for the company, there are significant opportunities in the Asian market, particularly in China, being driven primarily by the regulatory environment and consumer demand. By 2019, we predict that Asia will contribute approximately 30%

of net sales, with Europe accounting for approximately 40% and the Americas remaining approximately 30% of net sales. We believe that our competitive advantage within the global market is incredibly strong and we are making significant investments to optimize our manufacturing base while prioritizing R&D to maintain our leadership position.
In 2015, we are expecting another strong year despite the mixed economic environment in which we are operating. As of the writing of this letter, we anticipate net sales to grow between 2% and 6% and EPS within a range of $3.35 to $3.55 per diluted share. Excluding currency, we expect net sales growth in 2015 to be between 9.5% and 12%, right in line with our long-term target. We look forward to the exciting opportunities that 2015 brings as we make strides toward our growth trajectory.
