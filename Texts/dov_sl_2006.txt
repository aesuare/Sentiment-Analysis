Letter to Shareholders

A Strong Year for Shareholders, Customers and Employees
With 2006 revenue of over $6.5 billion and earnings from continuing operations of $2.94 per share, Dover set a new earnings record, easily surpassing its last record of $2.54 per share achieved in 2000. This EPS growth reflected strength in our end markets, acquisitions, and significant contributions from the "Performance COUNTS" initiative which challenges all Dover operating managers to achieve best-in-class goals in earnings improvement, inventory turns, operating margins, working capital and return on investment. Dover registered gains in all five metrics for the full year 2006 which drove our free cash flow generation to an all-time high of $684 million. In addition to a 34% year-over-year improvement in continuing earnings per share, driven by 22% growth in revenue, Dover increased its dividend for the 51st year in a row, the fourth longest reStrategic Portfolio Enhancement Activities Two years ago, I announced that we needed to reevaluate our portfolio of operating companies and determine whether we were favorably positioned in sustainable growth markets capable of driving improvements in shareholder cord on the New York Stock Exchange. Further, our best-in-class full year organic growth of 14% is a testament to the strategic initiatives of our operating companies and their focus on new product development, market expansion and customer service initiatives. With record earnings, the culmination of our portfolio review initiative, the addition of several exciting acquisitions and the benefits of our "Performance COUNTS" program, we are confident that we have set the stage for Dover's continued success in 2007 and beyond. value. That two year review process is now essentially completed. It resulted in the discontinuation of 20 companies with annualized revenue of nearly $1.1 billion and margins of about 5%. Fifteen of those companies have since been sold, including one in January of 2007, and the remaining five are expected to be sold in 2007. During that time, Dover added seventeen new acquisitions that are expected to bring $1.2 billion of revenue at roughly 15% margins. This portfolio restructuring focused on exiting a number of volatile capital goods businesses and refocusing our acquisition efforts on larger companies that serve broad higher growth markets and have significant recurring revenue opportunities. The culmination of these efforts is a portfolio containing several growth platforms that will drive Dover's future results. These growth platforms are groups of synergistic operating com-

panies that share common end-markets and benefit from similar manufacturing capabilities and product development initiatives. This year's annual report showcases four of our larger platforms. Although Dover's portfolio of companies will no doubt evolve further over time as we strive to optimize its performance, we believe the major portfolio rationalization process initiated two years ago is complete. Acquisition Momentum Continues 2006 was another very active and successful year building our company through acquisitions. As I announced last year, Dover has refocused its efforts on acquiring larger companies that meet our selective criteria. We believe bigger companies bring significant product development capabilities, enhanced growth opportunities, deeper management teams and the scale to expand globally, all of which should significantly enhance Dover's future performance. In 2006, Dover invested a record $1.1 billion on seven new value-creating acquisitions that also underscored our commitment to building key growth platforms. In particular, Markem, O'Neil, and Paladin, our three major acquisitions, enhanced our product identification and material handling platforms. Markem, with annualized sales of about $290 million, joined Dover Technologies' Product Identification platform.

Markem is one of the world leaders in thermal transfer printing and laser marking. This acquisition closed in early December and the synergy initiatives and integration plans for leveraging its products and customer base with other Dover Product Identification companies are currently under development. This acquisition, along with O'Neil, a leading portable printer company, clearly puts Dover in the position of being a worldwide leader with a broad array of solutions to meet the ever expanding product identification requirements of our global customer base. Paladin is the leading independent manufacturer of specialty attachments for enhancing the utilization of construction equipment, such as tractors, front loaders, excavators, backhoes, skid steer loaders and utility trucks. Paladin products serve a very broad range of applications in the light and heavy

With annualized sales of about $350 million and a strong aftermarket focus, Paladin joins Dover Resources' broad Material Handling platform. We anticipate significant opportunities to improve the financial performance of Paladin, based on its current internal initiatives, global sourcing efforts and recent manufacturing expansion into Mexico. We are truly excited to welcome these acquisitions to the Dover family and look forward to their future contributions to Dover's performance. In summary, we are confident that our revamped portfolio of operating companies, coupled with our focus on larger acquisitions that can serve broader markets with greater recurring revenue opportunities, will benefit our shareholders well through future economic cycles.

Record Growth Dover's record revenue and earnings were the product of several strong performances at the subsidiary level. First and foremost, Dover Electronics experienced a 155% increase in earnings while growing revenue 61%. These spectacular results were driven by the excellent performance of Knowles Electronics and a strong focus on leveraging synergies at Microwave Products Group, Ceramics Product Group and Vectron. Dover Technologies revenue growth of 27% drove a 53% increase in earnings. Both our Product Identification and Automation and Measurement businesses produced great results and are poised to build upon the successes of 2006. Dover Resources, our largest segment, posted increases in both revenue and earnings of 21%. This strength was primarily driven by our Oil and Gas Equipment businesses which continued to enjoy a

robust end-market in 2006. Dover Industries maintained its focus on the "Performance COUNTS" program by sequentially improving its operating margins in each quarter of 2006. A solid 7% gain in revenue leveraged into a 19% improvement in earnings. The Mobile Equipment businesses showed great results in 2006 driven by strong demand for fuel tankers and refuse trucks while the Service Equipment businesses produced a modest increase in earnings off a small decline in revenue in a flat growth environment. Dover Systems experienced significant topline growth of 18% and a 14% increase in earnings. This performance was primarily driven by Hill Phoenix which continued to win market share while managing heavy customer demand in a challenging cost environment. Dover Diversified had a mixed performance with revenue up 8% and earn-
