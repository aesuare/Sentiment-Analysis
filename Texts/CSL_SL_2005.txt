Dear Shareholders:
The year 2005 was a year of growth and change for Carlisle as we focused on building better businesses. We initiated strategic changes in 2005 that make us a more focused company and better positioned for growth. We realigned the company into three business segments, restructured our operating management team, acquired two heavy-duty braking businesses, announced the opening of two new roofing in-
sulation manufacturing plants, and announced plans to sell thirteen of our businesses that have not been core operations of Carlisle. These steps help us to strategically plan our future – and sharpen our focus – in those industries we know best and where we have demonstrated success. What did not change was the dedication of our exceptional workforce and experienced operat- ing management, some of whom you will see on the pages of this report, and all of whom are committed to the success of our company.
Now for the 2005 results: sales from continuing operations were $2.21 billion
and earnings per share from continuing operations were $4.29. This represents a 10% and 22% increase, respectively. Our return on beginning equity from continuing operations was 19.1%. Our EBIT (earnings before
interest and taxes) margins from continuing operations improved from 8.7% in 2004 to 9.5% in 2005. We were also pleased to provide our shareholders with a dividend increase for the 29th consecutive year.
During 2005 we realigned Carlisle to focus on our core businesses. This entailed several important steps. We:
• Consolidated a number of smaller Carlisle companies under new management in the Diversified Components Group, providing greater focus and enhanced capabilities to drive improved revenue and profitability in each individual business;
• Strengthened our braking businesses by acquiring the heavy-duty brake assets of Zhejiang Kete in Hangzhou, China, and the off-highway brake assets of ArvinMeritor in York, South Carolina, and Cwmbran, South Wales;
• Announced the opening of two new roofing insulation manufacturing plants in Tooele, Utah and Smithfield, Pennsylvania, a
critical execution strategy to enhance our national sales and service capabilities in our Construction Materials business;
• Announced plans to sell 13 of our non-core operations; and
• Implemented a new management structure that organizes Carlisle into three operating groups, down from five:

Our goals for 2006 include building upon concepts and practices that have driven our success. We will continue to create and extend competitive advantage in all our markets. Unique goals are developed for each of our business
units. These goals are weighted to drive performance in such areas as organic sales growth, return on invested capital, margin improvement and operating cash flow that will reinforce each unit’s specific near and long-term financial and strategic goals.
We will intensify the level of service
we provide to our customers and at
every opportunity seek to create what
our customers want before they ask for
it. Our decentralized operating structure will continue to encourage our operating management to make decisions for their businesses at the local company level while challenging our management team to plan
strategically and execute vigorously with a focus on the long-term. Our emphasis on accelerating growth is focused on four basic areas: Cost, Service, Quality and Innovation.
All of our operating companies will continue to benefit from Carlisle’s overall corporate strength as well as improved cash generation driven by our new structure focused on better businesses. We will creatively and energetically employ our resources to maximize value at every opportunity. Stock market participants may measure us quarter by quarter, but we are managing our businesses with a long-term commitment. Every decision we make will have the long-range interests of Carlisle’s shareholders in mind.
Reflecting on the past year, we wish we had organized our business portfolio sooner. While we may have been slow to do so, and we were rightly criticized for it, we ended the
year where we wanted to be: a leaner, more focused company.
It’s been a year of change and a year of
solid growth. It was a year in which we made decisions that will serve Carlisle’s employees, customers and shareholders well for many years. We see great opportunity ahead for our company and we are confident that as long as we plan and execute well, Carlisle will continue to grow and create value. And that is exactly what we intend to do.
