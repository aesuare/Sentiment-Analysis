Timken
The acquisition of The Torrington Company represents a powerful move by a strong company. It builds on our proud heritage and bodes well for a promising future.
During three years of transformation, Timken
associates prepared well for such a move,
building the company into a leaner, more competitive world leader with a strong balance sheet and solid cash flows.

Why buy Torrington? This most significant event in the company's
history creates a platform for accelerating both profitability and growth. Timken and Torrington have been global leaders in their areas of expertise. With the acquisition, we build an organization that will be better able to compete strongly the world over. At the same time, we improve our ability to provide additional value for Timken shareholders and customers. We’ve positioned ourselves structurally and financially to
'catch the wave' as economies and markets recover.
Specifically, this acquisition offers the company opportunities to:
• Leverage our core competencies by offering a strong strategic fit. Timken is a world leader in applying bearing steel material science to anti-friction bearings. Torrington is a leading worldwide producer of needle roller, heavy-duty roller and ball bearings, and motion control components and assemblies. Together, we become a global leader in three complementary product and service lines: tapered roller bearings,
needle roller bearings and alloy steels.
• Bolster our presence in the automotive markets by building on the strengths of each organization. The addition of Torrington's customized bearings solutions business significantly strengthens Timken's existing automotive segment and provides opportunities for innovation in a dynamic area – power train systems. The combined company's engineering expertise enables our customers to benefit from innovative new products and components to further enhance their competitive positions. For example, Torrington's sophisticated needle bearing solutions for automotive power train applications strongly complement Timken's leading tapered roller bearing and precision steel component solutions for wheel ends and drivelines. Following the
acquisition, Timken is one of the top 100 automotive suppliers worldwide.

 • Improve service to industrial customers by offering a broader line of engineered products and services. The acquisition enables us to bring our expanded product and service offerings to new markets and leverage our geographic presence to provide more products and services to our distribu- tion network. For other industries, the acquisition creates the opportunity for Timken to provide a broadened base of technology, market and applications knowledge for customers and distributors globally. One important result is more integrated engineering solutions for new
original equipment designs and the opening up of new market segments.
• Create an even more competitive global presence. Although Torrington is U.S.-based, it has operations and affiliations in Asia, Europe and around the world, which strengthen our own global operations. Having manufacturing, engineering, sales and marketing close to our customers, wherever in the world they are, strengthens our ability to serve them.
• Build upon the reputation of our Timken technologists. The research, engineering and product development knowledge and experience of the experts at Torrington are a strong match for our organization. The result is a fiercely competitive global team.
Timken and Torrington are very similar in heritage, brand promise and market approach, which will facilitate integration. Both companies were founded on a patented innovation – Timken, the tapered roller bearing, and Torrington, the needle roller bearing. And both companies, through more than 100 years in business, have built strong traditions of quality, technology and innovation.
A key to capitalizing on the value of Torrington is to fully integrate it into Timken – to move ahead as one operating enterprise. We believe we have put the resources in place to achieve that. And while we are pursuing cost savings through synergies, this acquisition is really about growing the company profitably. The knowledge and operational base at Torrington is central to that growth. We welcome the great capabilities of the Torrington associates, whom we highly respect.
With the acquisition, we all join the same team. We'll become one integrated organization, poised for enhanced profitability and growth. It's an exciting prospect.
