TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
2009 was a difficult but successful year for Jones Lang LaSalle, as our people outperformed the market to deliver a strong finish to a
challenging 12 months.
Starting the year in the depths of the Great Recession, we finished 2009 by achieving the “Twice and First” goals we had set five years
earlier:
Twice: We more than doubled our revenues, from $1.2 billion in 2004 to $2.5 billion in 2009.
First: We secured our leadership position in the real estate services and investment management industry.
For us, First means being the leader—the best in our business—as determined by clients, industry organizations and other third-party
observers. For example, Procter & Gamble named us “Supplier of the Year” for the second consecutive year in 2009, one of only seven of
P&G’s 80,000 suppliers worldwide to receive the honor. We virtually swept the 2009 EuroMoney Awards, earning awards that included Best
Overall Global Advisor and Consultant honors and, for our LaSalle Investment Management business, Global Best Investment Manager
Overall.
Already this year, and for the third year running, we have been named one of the 2010 World’s Most Ethical Companies by the Ethisphere
Institute. And the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has selected us 2010 Energy Star Partner of the Year. We believe that these awards,
along with the many others we received, speak far more convincingly about our leadership credentials and core business values than any
claims we might make ourselves.
2009 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Full-year revenue was $2.5 billion in 2009, 8 percent below 2008 totals and 5 percent lower in local currencies. We reported a net loss of $4
million, or $0.11 per share, for 2009. Adjusting for restructuring and co-investment charges, net income would have been $70 million, or
$1.75 per share. Adjusted EBITDA was $239 million for the year.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, capitalizing on early signs of economic recovery, we reported net income of $52 million, or $1.19 a share,
compared to $41 million, or $1.17 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2008. Adjusting for restructuring and co-investment charges, fourth-
quarter 2009 net income would have been $63 million, or $1.44 per share. Adjusted fourth-quarter EBITDA was $112 million.
We maintained a strong balance sheet in 2009. With the proceeds of our successful stock offering in June and the strong cash flow that our
business generated, we reduced our net bank debt by $334 million during the year. The outstanding balance of our long-term credit facilities
was $175 million at year-end. Finally, investor confidence in Jones Lang LaSalle was reflected in our strong share price performance during
the year.
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES
Building on the momentum and market share we gained last year, we entered 2010 confident about the future and uniquely well-positioned to
take advantage of new opportunities that have begun to emerge around the world. A year ago, real estate markets were universally bad.
Today the situation is stabilizing, and we see signs of recovery in a number of areas.
In general, we anticipate a recovery in investment sales markets, while leasing markets, driven by supply and demand fundamentals, will
continue to lag. Real estate markets overall around the world remain in vastly different stages of health, from continued decline to selective
recovery.
Our response has been to focus selectively on opportunities we identify, while continuing to strengthen our position across markets and
service lines to take full advantage of the recovery as it emerges.
IDENTIFYING SHORT-TERM OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES
To help guide us as the recession recedes, midway through 2009 the firm’s Global Executive Committee identified four short-term
operational priorities.
First, we will continue to focus externally on clients and new business prospects, both to identify and respond to changing client demands and
to expand existing relationships and establish new ones. We believe that a major share of our growth over the next five years will come from
the deeper relationships we develop with clients we serve today.
Our second priority will be to maintain strict controls on costs. During the recession we responded quickly and aggressively to reduce costs
and right-size our operations in the face of deteriorating market conditions. We intend to maintain that cost discipline as markets recover.
Continued cost containment will support our third priority, rebuilding profit margins that were compressed during the downturn.
Investing selectively will be our fourth operational priority. We will hire individuals and teams, and make small targeted acquisitions, in
areas where we anticipate that new growth will reward such investments. But we believe that a significant percentage of new revenue and
profits will come from the global service platform we developed during the past five years. With our platform essentially complete, we will
begin to reap the full potential of our investments as markets pick up again.
REFRESHING OUR G5 GLOBAL GROWTH PRIORITIES
In 2005, we identified five strategic global growth priorities which we refer to as the G5. They are consistent around the world and guide our
efforts to build and grow our business globally. As with our goals and operational priorities, we reexamined the G5 last year. Once again, we
concluded that, for the most part, they remain aligned and consistent with our goals and strategy.
G1 addresses our presence and position in key markets around the world. Gs 2, 3 and 4 reflect priorities for building our competitive strength
in global businesses where we have advantages which we believe our competitors lack. The fifth G is new: It identifies the opportunity to
further differentiate our firm by continuing to enhance our ability to connect externally with clients and internally among our own people.
G1 BUILD OUR LEADING LOCAL AND REGIONAL MARKET POSITIONS.
Because real estate transactions and services take place on the ground in markets
around the world, we continually focus on building the depth of our skills and services in key cities. The successful 2009 integration of our
2008 merger with The Staubach Company, which contributed significantly to our strong performance in the Americas region last year, is one
example of our success with this priority.
We will also expand our geographical presence carefully and selectively when we identify compelling market needs or opportunities. In
March 2010, for example, we opened a corporate office in Cairo, our first in Africa.
G2 STRENGTHEN OUR LEADING POSITION IN CORPORATE SOLUTIONS.
G2 reflects our goal of maintaining and extending our position as the leading
provider of outsourcing services to corporate occupiers around the world. Our Corporate Solutions business grew substantially and
consistently through the recession, reflecting steadily growing demand among corporate clients to reduce costs associated with real estate.
We established 47 new Corporate Solutions relationships in 2009, expanded existing relationships with 31 clients and renewed our contracts
with another 44 clients. We also found that average revenue per new business contract in 2009 was nearly 60 percent higher than in 2008.
The picture for corporate outsourcing remains encouraging. Our new business pipeline is as strong as it was a year ago. To turn these
opportunities into new assignments, we remain committed to elevating the quality and consistency of our service delivery throughout the
world.
In February, for the third consecutive year, we were named to the Leaders category of The 2010 Global Outsourcing 100®, an annual ranking of high-quality outsourcing service providers across all industries.
G3 CAPTURE THE LEADING SHARE OF GLOBAL CAPITAL FLOWS FOR INVESTMENT SALES.
Our third global priority is to maximize our share of global capital
invested in real estate. The world’s real estate investment sales markets continued to suffer in 2009, as investors could not obtain credit, and
buyers and sellers could not agree on pricing in most markets for most of the year.
We have begun to see conditions stabilize in some countries. In France, although overall 2009 capital markets volumes were down 40 percent
compared to 2008, our Capital Markets team doubled its market share to nearly 20 percent of volume transacted, moving to the number one
position from number three in 2008. We were market leaders in the United Kingdom as well, where property values were among the first to
show signs of recovery. Prices had also begun to recover in some Asian markets by year end, including Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and
Seoul.
Going forward we will continue to target local and international capital markets business, since there is profitable business to be won and
good clients to be served at both levels. Thanks to our network of wholly owned offices around the world, we can work successfully both
locally and globally, while most competitors cannot. Our aim remains to make sure that we have deep skills in our local offices to keep pace
with local competitors, while continuing to build our excellent international reputation for cross-border capital markets expertise.
G4 STRENGTHEN LASALLE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT’S LEADERSHIP POSITION.
Throughout the downturn, LaSalle Investment Management protected
its reputation as a stable, transparent and client-focused partner adding value to property and managing risk for its clients.
Our second priority will be to maintain strict controls on costs. During the recession we responded quickly and aggressively to reduce costs
and right-size our operations in the face of deteriorating market conditions. We intend to maintain that cost discipline as markets recover.
Continued cost containment will support our third priority, rebuilding profit margins that were compressed during the downturn.

profits will come from the global service platform we developed during the past five years. With our platform essentially complete, we will
begin to reap the full potential of our investments as markets pick up again.

G4 STRENGTHEN LASALLE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT’S LEADERSHIP POSITION.
Throughout the downturn, LaSalle Investment Management protected
its reputation as a stable, transparent and client-focused partner adding value to property and managing risk for its clients.
As many investment managers faltered in a challenging year for raising real estate capital, LaSalle Investment Management reaffirmed its
leadership position by successfully raising over $4 billion of net equity in 2009, gaining commitments in separate accounts, funds and public
securities.
With institutional money beginning to flow back into stable, income-producing core assets in most parts of the world, LaSalle is focused on
taking advantage of the problems of competitors to gain market share and expand its leadership position.
G5 CONNECTIONS: DIFFERENTIATE BY CONNECTING ACROSS THE FIRM, AND WITH CLIENTS.
To take full advantage of the progress we have made on G1
through G4, we identified a new fifth G, Connections, to more effectively link up our people and businesses globally and optimize our client
service delivery capabilities.
During the past five years, we invested in people, businesses, systems, processes and technology to build a global service delivery platform
that is unique in our industry. Now, supported by our culture—which values and rewards teamwork and collaboration—we are continuing to
knit these global operations even more closely together, creating stronger connections with our clients and across our business to generate
higher levels of client service and profitable new growth.
We are focusing on connections because that is what our clients need and demand. Only 5 percent of them are purely local organizations
whose needs are limited to a single market. All the others want to be served across geographies with a broader range of services. By creating
stronger linkages across markets, service lines, industries and asset classes, we are responding to their needs while, at the same time, creating
new growth and improved revenue quality for Jones Lang LaSalle.
WELCOMING AND THANKING MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS
In 2009 we welcomed a new Director to our Board and thanked two departing Directors for their distinguished service to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Ming Lu was first elected to the Board of Directors in May 2009. Based in Hong Kong, Mr. Lu is a partner with KKR & Co., L.P., a leading
global alternative asset manager which sponsors and manages funds that make investments in private equity, fixed income and other assets in
North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Before joining KKR, he was a partner at JP Morgan Partners Asia Pte Ltd., a private
equity fund focusing on investments in Asia. Given the depth and scope of his business career, and his experience as a partner in two leading
private equity firms, Mr. Lu brings perspectives on conducting business in Asia to our firm that are particularly valuable as we continue to
grow market share in the region.
Professor Henri-Claude de Bettignies decided to retire after ten years of Board service. Having held distinguished academic positions at the
European Institute of Business Administration (INSEAD), the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS) and the Stanford
Business School, Professor de Bettignies enriched Board discussions with his global perspectives on corporate responsibility, sustainability
and leadership.
Alain Monié, President and Chief Operating Officer of the global information technology distributor, Ingram Micro, Inc., decided not to
stand for reelection after four years of Board service to devote more time to his other business activities. We benefited from his distinguished
career as a senior operational officer with major corporations on three continents.
LOOKING AHEAD
In the March 2010 edition of the
Global Market Perspective
, our monthly publication which tracks and interprets changing conditions in
world real estate markets, our researchers noted:
“Recovery is tangible, and sentiment in the world’s major real estate markets is clearly more positive than a year ago. Investment
markets are improving across the globe, with a significant weight of money chasing real estate opportunities.... Leasing markets, too,
are showing signs of increased activity.... However, even in the most buoyant markets, confidence is still being dampened by the
persistent debt crisis, constrained lending and the trillions of dollars of property debt still reluctantly held by the banks.”
Countries, businesses and markets will clearly have to deal with the consequences of the downturn for some time to come. But these
emerging market trends give us great confidence that it is time to turn the page and get on with business.
Thanks to the skills and commitment of our people around the world, we emerged from the recession a far stronger company and competitor.
In 2010 and the coming years, our people will continue to create real value for our clients as markets evolve and new opportunities emerge.
And we will continue to grow our business profitably, always putting the best interests of those clients first, connecting across businesses and
geographies to produce the best results for them, and conducting business ethically and with the highest integrity.
Thank you for your continued interest in Jones Lang LaSalle.
