 DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER:
Our acquisition of the distribution and pipeline operations of TXU Gas has created a powerful union— which is the subject of much of this year’s report.
The acquisition, which closed on October 1, 2004, has exceeded our best expectations, as measured on several dimensions. It contributed to Atmos Energy’s extraordinary financial results in fiscal 2005. It transformed Atmos Energy into the largest all-natural- gas distribution company in the country, and it created major opportunities for future growth.
Atmos Energy’s gross profit in fiscal 2005 doubled to exceed $1 billion for the first time in our company’s history. Net income increased 58 percent to a record $135.8 million, and earnings per diluted share grew by 14 cents to $1.72.
Fiscal 2005 marked our fifth year of consistently improved performance. Our total return to shareholders was 17.2 percent, and our return on average shareholders’ equity was 9.0 percent.
Recognizing these accomplishments, the Board of Directors raised the dividend by 2 cents to an indicated annual rate of $1.26 per share. This marked our 18th consecutive annual increase. Moreover, when adjusted for mergers and acquisitions, Atmos Energy’s dividend has gone up every year since it was formed in 1983.
The acquisition has nearly doubled the size of our utility operations by adding 1.5 million gas utility customers in Texas. Overall, the additional territory exceeds national averages for customer growth. In particular, the Dallas and Fort Worth metropolitan areas as well as the northern suburbs of Austin are experiencing strong residential and commercial development.
Integrating the former TXU Gas employees and operations has gone exceptionally well. Our integration teams have exceeded goals and completed work well ahead of deadlines. In particular, we are proud of the conversion of all the former back-office and information technology systems. We no longer are using any outsourced services for meter reading, customer billing or telephone call centers. We expect that using our own state-of-the-art systems will lead to improved customer satisfaction and lower long-term operating costs.
EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Atmos Energy’s employees did more than just deliver on the company’s promise of $1.65 to $1.75 in earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2005. They overcame warmer- than-normal weather that reduced earnings by 29 cents per diluted share, dilution from a year-over-year increase of 24.6 million more shares outstanding and the ravages of two hurricanes that affected two-thirds of our Louisiana operations and a portion of our Mississippi territory.
The TXU Gas acquisition was a major contributor to earnings. It was accretive in the first year—adding 18 cents to earnings per diluted share. That result far surpassed our original estimate of a contribution from 5 cents to 10 cents per diluted share.

PIPELINE AND STORAGE
An especially noteworthy part of the acquisition was our addition of one of the largest intrastate natural gas pipelines in Texas, which became the Atmos Pipeline– Texas Division. This expansive pipeline system, shown on page 9, supports our regulated utility operations by carrying natural gas from producers and storage fields to our local distribution system. It crisscrosses the state, with terminals at three major gas transportation hubs where we can buy gas from other intrastate lines and major interstate pipelines. It also transports volumes from the state’s nine major gas-producing basins, which hold a substantial portion of our country’s onshore natural gas reserves.
Atmos Pipeline–Texas gives us new opportunities to transport gas for producers to wider markets. In fiscal 2005, the pipeline added transportation volumes of 375.6 billion cubic feet (Bcf). It contributed $149.5 million, or 95 percent, of the $157.9 million in gross profit from our pipeline and storage segment. By comparison, the segment’s gross profit last year before the acquisition was just $10.4 million.
We are continuing to unlock added value from the Texas pipeline. We currently have four pipeline projects under way that we expect will add to earnings starting
in fiscal 2006. The largest of these is a joint-venture project to install 45 miles of 30-inch pipeline to serve the northern suburbs of the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. This new pipeline will help Atmos Energy deliver reliable natural gas supplies to one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the country. It also will provide needed gas transmission capacity to serve natural gas producers and shippers in the Texas intrastate wholesale gas market.
NATURAL GAS MARKETING
Our natural gas marketing segment produced exceptional results in fiscal 2005, contributing 30 cents per diluted share. The improvement largely was due
to achieving more favorable arbitrage spreads using our underground natural gas storage facilities. It also came from our marketing efforts that added customers in new areas.

THE METTLE of the atmos energy team
Across Louisiana to the Mississippi Delta, Atmos Energy employees responded courageously to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. After Katrina devastated southern Louisiana on August 29, Atmos Energy was the first utility back into hard-hit Jefferson Parish. There and elsewhere, employees — many of whom had lost their own homes—worked tirelessly, some living for weeks at company service centers in order to respond to customers’ needs. Atmos Energy mobilized supplies and manpower to aid its crews, displaced employees, customers and neighbors. The second storm, Rita, delivered a lesser blow to Atmos Energy’s operations in western Louisiana. Disruption was further minimized thanks to wise preparedness and fast response.

The TXU Gas acquisition opened up a large gas marketing area in Texas with hundreds of prospective customers, providing further confirmation that the acquisition is a good fit with all segments of our business.
During fiscal 2005, our nonutility operations contracted for 9.0 Bcf of additional working gas storage capacity and expanded our marketing efforts into four more states. Altogether, our natural gas marketing operations now serve more than 800 industrial, municipal and other customers in 22 states.
RATE STRATEGY
We continue to be successful in maintaining our rates, with $15 million to $25 million in average annual additions to our utility revenues. Part of the increase in fiscal 2005 came from our GRIP filings in Texas. GRIP, the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program, is a Texas law that permits natural gas utilities to earn a timely return of and on their basic investments. Without filing a lengthy rate case, a utility can raise rates annually
to pay for investments in pipelines and other facilities to maintain reliability and safety and to meet customer growth. The utility must file a complete rate case at least every five years to justify its GRIP expenditures.
Higher natural gas costs have intensified public scrutiny of all utilities’ rates. As a result, regulatory bodies in three of our states have been asked to review our rate structures. We are cooperating fully in these inquiries and believe our rates in all jurisdictions remain fair and reasonable.
In our rate filings, we are seeking to decouple the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns that are affected by weather, declining use and conservation. Because gas volumes fluctuate, our earnings depend on consumption factors over which we have little control. We are seeking to put more of our costs into our basic monthly customer charge and to add adjustments that help moderate the effects of the rise and fall in our gas sales volumes.
Our most recent rate agreement in Mississippi,
for example, reflects our decoupling goals. The state’s Public Service Commission allowed us to shift $10 million in annual margins from volume-based charges to fixed customer charges. We also were granted an improved weather normalization adjustment (WNA), which adjusts our rates when winter weather turns either unseasonably warm or cool, and we obtained a GRIP-like mechanism in Mississippi to reduce the regulatory lag for the investments we make on behalf of our customers.

 We have been successful in obtaining weather normalization adjustments for about one-third of our customer base. In our two largest jurisdictions, our Mid-Tex and Louisiana Divisions, we do not have WNA. In those areas, other rate-design features help offset the lack of weather protection—up to a point. In fiscal 2005, our Mid-Tex Division had weather that was 20 percent warmer than normal, and our Louisiana Division had weather that was 22 percent warmer than normal. Overall, weather was 11 percent warmer than normal in fiscal 2005, reducing our net income by $22.8 million, or 29 cents per diluted share.
In our rate filings, we also are seeking to recover the gas-cost portion of bad debt expense. As a public utility that is obligated to serve everyone in the community, we work to help the less-fortunate and other customers who have difficulty paying their energy bills. In return for supporting the community’s social needs by not disconnecting those who do not pay during the winter, we are asking regulators to let us recover the sizable costs
we incur for gas supplies used by our indigent customers.
PAYING DOWN DEBT
We financed our TXU Gas acquisition with two successful equity offerings, which raised about $618 million in
net proceeds, and with a sale of $1.39 billion of senior notes. Not unexpectedly, our debt level went up, which has occurred in the past to finance earlier transactions, yet we maintained investment-grade ratings with all of the major rating agencies.
We issued approximately 26 million new common shares in connection with the acquisition. Our weighted average number of common shares outstanding increased, year over year, by 24.6 million shares, causing dilution
in our per-share earnings.
Our total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, including short-term debt, was 59.3 percent at year- end. We are committed to paying down debt to return to the range of 50 percent to 55 percent during the next three to five years. We are confident we can do so to continue our reliable record of reducing our debt- to-equity ratio after major acquisitions.

In fiscal 2005, we generated operating cash flow of $386.9 million, compared with $270.7 million in fiscal 2004. Our capital expenditures increased to $333.2 million from $190.3 million in fiscal 2004, with virtually all the increase being spent on our Mid-Tex and Atmos Pipeline–Texas Divisions.
OUTLOOK FOR 2006
For fiscal 2006, we see more opportunities than ever before, largely because of the size and growth of our added operations in Texas. Our goal is to continue to grow our earnings at 4 percent to 6 percent a year on average. We estimate that earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2006 will reach $1.80 to $1.90, assuming normal weather and no material effect from marking to market our storage and related financial hedges.
We are especially mindful of the effects that volatile, high natural gas prices are having on our customers everywhere. More of our customers could have difficulty paying their bills this winter, and our bad debt expense could go up.
 We have stepped up a broad range of programs to help our customers as well as to seek increased natural gas supplies. Actions by Congress are sorely needed— to permit more gas exploration in coastal waters and on Western public lands, to build a pipeline from the abundant gas fields in Alaska and to permit liquefied natural gas terminals on domestic shores. These actions would help provide more natural gas and, in turn, would help lower gas prices.
In 2006, we also must deal with the lingering aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The hurricanes affected
up to 230,000 of our customers and reduced our fiscal 2005 net income by $3.8 million, or 5 cents per diluted share. To aid in the recovery, Atmos Energy and its employees donated nearly $1.5 million to the hurricane relief efforts.
Today we estimate a semi-permanent loss of about 40,000 meters in the four hardest hit parishes where we serve. Our lost margins in fiscal 2006 will
be between $10 million and $12 million. Nevertheless, in surveying the region just days after the destruction,
I became convinced that the resilient spirit of Louisiana residents and business owners will triumph over the storms’ fury. Their desire to rebuild is evident everywhere. It will just take time.
We estimate our capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 will total $400 million to $415 million. Of that total, about 60 percent will be spent on our growing Mid-Tex and Atmos Pipeline–Texas Divisions. Our spending reinforces our goal of investing growth capital to seek the best returns. Although one of our key strategies
is to continue to grow through sound acquisitions, our immediate goal is to reduce our debt with longer- term plans for future acquisitions.
LEADERSHIP CHANGES
It was my pleasure this year to announce the addition to the Board of Directors of Stephen R. Springer. I have known Steve for nearly three decades and have worked closely with him in the past. He brings an extensive background in the natural gas industry and a steadfast commitment to integrity and honesty. We are pleased he agreed to join our board.
On April 1, 2006, JD Woodward will retire as senior vice president, nonutility operations. He will be succeeded by Mark H. Johnson, who recently was named vice president, nonutility operations, and who also serves as president of our natural gas marketing subsidiary. JD founded Woodward Marketing, which became the core of our natural gas marketing segment. He has led all our nonutility operations since joining Atmos Energy in 2001. I deeply thank him for his friendship, his leadership and all he has done to serve our customers and employees and to produce results that have rewarded our shareholders.
We expect 2006 to be another prosperous year
for Atmos Energy. All of us appreciate your continuing support as investors. We pledge to protect your investment and to use it wisely to provide exceptional service to our 3.2 million customers and 1,500 communities. That is the best way we can ensure future financial success.
