 Letter to Stockholders
Amgen 2007 Annual Report 1
 Dear Stockholders,
2007 was not the year we expected. Amgen was challenged as never before across a broad front. Shareholder value suffered, top and bottom line growth slowed, and we found it necessary to restructure and shrink the organization.
There is another story about 2007 for Amgen that is equally true, and one I want to expand upon here without at all distancing ourselves from the difficult aspects of the year.
At the beginning of 2007, we were still enjoying a long period of unprecedented growth. From 2001 to early 2007, we grew adjusted earnings per share (EPS)* and revenue at compound annual growth rates of 27 and 29 percent, respectively;** our share price approached an all-time high; the pipeline expanded dramatically; we successfully completed and delivered on what was at the time the industry’s largest acquisition (Immunex) and two other major acquisitions (Tularik and Abgenix); and the organization grew to more than 20,000 staff operating in 35 countries.
Then in the first quarter of 2007 a clinical trial, exploring the use of our anemia medicine Aranesp® in cancer patients with anemia related to their underlying disease, revealed a new safety concern in a population not indicated for this medicine. While this trial properly and appropriately explored an off-label use of Aranesp®, its results and those of several other off-label studies led to more restrictive labeling and stricter reimbursement limits in the U.S. Medicare program.
Amgen responded to new safety data as they became known to us by making appropriately prompt and transparent disclosures of the relevant facts to regulatory authorities, physicians and patients. We put patients first, then dealt with the business consequences. That’s what shareholders expect and what we demand of ourselves.
The safety challenges of 2007 drove a dramatic reduction in planned revenue and profit and changed the financial trajectory of the company. Amgen quickly adapted to this

  Dennis Fenton, Ph.D., Retires After 25 Years
In 2007, Dennis Fenton announced his decision to retire—a declaration that profoundly affected the thousands of Amgen staff who know firsthand Dennis’ energy and passion for our mission to serve patients. Over the years, Dennis worked in nearly every function at Amgen. After starting as a research scientist, he helped to create Amgen’s Process Development and Manufacturing organizations. At various times he led Sales and Marketing, Research, Information Systems, Human Resources, and most recently Operations. Dennis helped build the world’s most reliable, efficient and skilled biotechnology manufacturing organization to ensure that Amgen delivers vital medicines to “every patient, every time.” Dennis, we’ll miss you, and we wish you and your family many happy times ahead.

new reality, kept focused on our mission to serve patients, and demonstrated that we are resilient and can take a punch. We met the needs of patients and providers for our currently approved medicines, advanced the pipeline, successfully defended our intellectual property, and positioned ourselves to deliver strong financial results in the future.
Before detailing our 2007 accomplishments, I want to share my thinking about the environment we face and how we are meeting the challenges and demands of this new world. Physicians, patients and regulators have always understood that no medicine is perfect and that benefit must always be balanced against risk. There has also been a recognition that while pre-approval clinical trials may be well designed and conducted, we often learn more about medicines as they are more broadly used over the years in larger patient populations. Recently, a combination of factors has increased the focus on the risk dimensions of medicines, and the FDA and other regulators have responded. There is more focus on safety and greater urgency around ensuring that safety concerns are quickly and fully disclosed, thoroughly explored and considered, and aggressively recognized in setting payment and usage policy.
The implication for Amgen and our industry colleagues is that we must focus even more intently on safety risk management.
Amgen has always been committed to meeting the very highest standards with regard to patient safety, and we are reinforcing those standards in every area of our organization. In practical terms that means continued full disclosure of safety-related concerns; early, robust, and ongoing discussions with regulators; aggressive and extensive clinical trial-based safety exploration and post-approval safety surveillance; and effective two-way dialogues with providers and patient groups. Our mission is to serve patients; our commitment to patient safety is unwavering.
I am very proud of our accomplishments in the face of our recent challenges. It is in tough times that companies find out what they are made of, and 2007 brought out exceptional efforts by Amgen staff worldwide.
• We demonstrated that we take very seriously our responsibility and obligation to disclose safety information quickly and transparently to regulatory authorities, physicians and patients.
• We listened carefully to regulatory authorities, physicians and patient groups regarding our anemia medicines and worked with them to seek the best answers for patients.
• We restructured the company. We cut operating expenses, dramatically reduced planned capital expenditures, and took other swift and decisive actions to protect EPS and fund and advance the pipeline. Despite the unexpected reduction in operating income, we delivered 2007 adjusted EPS* of $4.29, very close to the low end of our original guidance.
• We successfully defended our intellectual property rights against Roche. Following a jury trial in the U.S. Federal District Court in Boston, Roche’s peg-EPO product was found to infringe 10 of Amgen’s U.S. patent claims for erythropoietin alfa.
• Product sales outside of our ESA franchise grew 14 percent. Enbrel®, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® grew, Sensipar® thrived, and our international business delivered great results.
• Even in the midst of a challenging restructuring, our manufacturing operations group turned in a stellar performance, with an outstanding safety record and highly successful compliance-related inspections. Most importantly, we delivered reliable supply for patients.
*See reconciliation on page 6.

• We had an enormously productive year in research and development, with unprecedented expansion of our early pipeline. We introduced 13 new molecules into development, including two phase 2 candidates from acquisitions of Ilypsa and Alantos.
• We advanced our mid- to late-stage pipeline, including nine phase 2 programs that we hope to progress towards late-stage clinical trials.
• We also moved forward with denosumab, our novel monoclonal antibody we are developing for postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone metastases, and other serious bone loss conditions. Early this year, we announced promising findings from our head-to-head study comparing denosumab to alendronate in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density. We look forward to communicating more study results as we have them, including important phase 3 fracture data we expect to review later this year.
• We recently announced an exciting new partnership in Japan with Takeda, who will acquire rights in Japan to VectibixTM and Japanese development rights to as many as 12 additional molecules from Amgen’s pipeline. In return, we receive a substantial upfront fee, success-based milestones and royalties, which we will use to advance our pipeline globally. This collaboration validates the significant value of our clinical pipeline and further ensures patients in Japan and around the world will have access to our potential new medicines for serious illness.
We know that 2008 will bring new challenges. Based on our performance in 2007, I am confident that we can handle whatever happens. We are ready.
