We are entering the fifth year of this severe housing recession. Last year at this time, Lehman Brothers had recently collapsed, paralyzing the financial markets. Now, one year later, after massive government intervention, the debate about the economy and the housing industry seems no longer to be focused on whether we have seen the bottom, but rather, when and how quickly the economy and the housing market will recover. Our declining cancellation rate(1) and improved pace of contract signings provide some signs of recovery. From elevated levels ranging from 18% to 39% over the prior 12 quarters, our cancellation rate has improved dramatically -- down to 8.5% in our third quarter, and then to 6.9%, our historical average, in our fourth quarter. We also note the improved pace of our net contracts signed per community this fourth quarter, which, although well below our historical averages, exceeded fourth-quarter paces dating back to FY 2006. A number of factors continue to weigh on the housing market. The nation's unemployment rate in November 2009 remained elevated at 10%, but was down from October's 10.2%, the highest in 26 years, and the rate for college graduates, our primary demographic, was a much lower 4.9%. Recent news reports indicate that one in four Americans has a mortgage that exceeds the value of the home, which restricts their ability to sell and move to another home. On the other hand, affordability hovers near an all-time high, mortgage rates are near historic lows, and home prices, although down to 2003 levels, have improved sequentially over the past two quarters according to the most recent S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. And although the volume of home sales continues to be near record lows, inventories of unsold homes are declining nationally. The choppiness in demand that began after Labor Day, following a stronger period from late March through late August, has continued. This is consistent with recent weaker economic news. Since the holiday season is not typically the busiest time to purchase or sell homes, we suspect the housing market may be following seasonal buying patterns. We believe it may take some time for Americans to regain confidence in our economy, their job status, and the benefits of homeownership. Therefore, we anticipate a gradual recovery in housing, similar to the one that occurred over several years coming out of the last recession in the early 1990s. 6 Toll Brothers 2009 Annual Report We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity as we wrestle with the downturn and prepare for the eventual upturn. We ended FY 2009 with a net debt-to-capital ratio(2) of 7.4%, our lowest level ever, compared to 12.6% at FYE 2008. At FYE 2009, we had $1.91 billion of cash and marketable U.S. Treasury securities, compared to $1.66 billion at FY 2009's third-quarter end and $1.63 billion at FYE 2008. At FYE 2009, we had $1.38 billion available under our $1.89 billion 30-bank credit facility, which matures in March 2011. We were pleased that Standard & Poor's recently reaffirmed our investment-grade corporate credit rating and upgraded our outlook to "Stable" in recognition of our solid financial position. In April 2009, we became the first public home builder to tap the public debt markets in the aftermath of the September 2008 financial crisis. Since then, we have raised $650 million of senior debt in the public markets with a weighted average maturity of 9.1 years at the time of issuance and retired $543 million of public debt with shorter-term maturities, including, most recently, the remaining $48 million of our outstanding FY 2012 Senior Subordinated Notes on December 1, 2009. Therefore, we have extended the average term of our public debt maturities from 3.5 to 6.1 years and now have no public debt maturing before FY 2013. Our FY 2009 results reflect the difficult housing market and the impact of the financial crisis that continues to ripple through the economy. In FY 2009 we reported a net loss of $755.8 million, or $4.68 per share diluted, which was impacted by non-cash pre-tax inventory and other write-downs totaling $476.7 million, a pre-tax charge of $13.7 million related to the early retirement of debt, and a $458.3 million non-cash expense for deferred tax asset valuation allowances. Excluding inventory and other write-downs and charges for early retirement of debt, FY 2009's full-year pre-tax loss was $6.1 million. This compared to FY 2008's net loss of $297.8 million, or $1.88 per share diluted, which was impacted by non-cash pre-tax inventory and other write-downs totaling $848.9 million, a non-cash $24.1 million expense for deferred tax valuation allowances, and $40.2 million of other pre-tax income attributable to net proceeds received from a condemnation judgment. FY 2008's full-year pre-tax earnings were $341.9 million, excluding inventory and other write-downs and the condemnation proceeds.

We continue to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity as we enter the fifth year of the housing recession. At the end of FY 2009, we had $3.3 billion of liquidity, including more than $1.9 billion in cash and marketable U.S. Treasury securities and $1.38 billion available under our 30-bank credit facility, which matures in March 2011.

Our FY 2009 home building deliveries and revenues of 2,965 units and $1.76 billion declined 37% in units and 44% in dollars compared to FY 2008, and our fiscal-year-end backlog of 1,531 units and $874.8 million declined 25% in units and 34% in dollars compared to FYE 2008. FYE 2009 net signed contracts of 2,450 units and $1.30 billion declined 16% and 19% respectively, compared to FY 2008. In contrast to FY 2008, which started out tough and got progressively worse, FY 2009 progressed in a positive direction beginning in March until softening after Labor Day. In our FY 2009 fourth quarter, net signed contracts of 765 units and $430.8 million rose 42% in units and 62% in dollars compared to FY 2008's fourth-quarter totals. Although comparisons to FY 2008's fourth quarter are distorted because of the September 2008 financial meltdown, FY 2009's fourth-quarter totals also exceeded FY 2007's fourth-quarter net signed contracts by 17% in units and 18% in dollars. These increases were achieved despite having fewer selling communities: during FY 2009's fourth quarter, the Company averaged 215 selling communities, down 26% from 290 in FY 2008's fourth quarter and down 32% from 315, its fourth-quarter peak, in FY 2007. FY 2009's average fourth-quarter net signed contracts of 3.56 units per community exceeded FY 2008's fourth-quarter average of 1.86 units per community by 91%, and exceeded FY 2007's fourth-quarter average of 2.08 units per community by 71%. FY 2009's average was 4% above FY 2006's fourth-quarter average of 3.42 units per community, but still well below the Company's 20-year fourth-quarter average of 6.16 units per community. We ended FY 2009 with a significantly lower backlog than at FYE 2008 and, as a result, expect the number of homes we deliver in FY 2010 will be lower than the 2,965 homes we delivered in FY 2009. We estimate that we will deliver between 2,000 and 2,750 homes in FY 2010 at an average price of between $540,000 and $560,000 per home. We have been reducing our community count over the past 2.5 years in response to slower demand. We ended FY 2009 with 200 selling communities, compared to 273 selling communities at FYE 2008. We expect to end FY 2010 with approximately 200 selling communities, down approximately 38% from our peak of 325 selling communities at FY 2007's second-quarter end. We have nearly 100 communities that have been mothballed or delayed, many of which can be brought to market relatively quickly if demand improves. We ended FY 2009 with approximately 31,900 home sites owned and optioned. This is down 20% from approximately 39,800 at FYE 2008, and

down 65% from our peak of approximately 91,200 at FY 2006's secondquarter end. Due to the long downturn in our industry, we believe builders and land developers have been unwilling or unable to take land through the approval process, and that, when the market picks up, there will be a shortage of approved land in some markets. We believe our current land position could give us an advantage. In the past few months, we have been seeing and competing for a greater number of attractive land acquisition opportunities from financial institutions and other sellers. With our strong cash position, our record low net debt-to-capital ratio, and our demonstrated access to liquidity, we believe we can take advantage of opportunities that arise from the current state of distress in our industry. As has happened in previous downturns, we believe there will be further consolidation in our industry. Many of the small and mid-sized private builders, which historically have been our primary competitors in the luxury niche, are facing serious capital constraints, among other problems, and are either hobbled or no longer in business. The other major public home building companies remain primarily focused on the lower end of the housing market, rather than on the luxury niche. Facing less competition and supported by our strong balance sheet, our diverse product lines, our broad geographic footprint, and our brand name and reputation for dependability, value, quality, and service, we believe we are well positioned to gain market share as the housing market gradually recovers. We thank our shareholders for their patience, our capital providers for their confidence in us, our customers for their support in choosing us, and our suppliers and contractors for their relationships. We especially thank our entire Toll Brothers team for their continued commitment to our customers; dedication to our goals of providing quality, value, and service to our buyers; and diligence and perseverance in the face of very difficult times.
