      LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS P03
  To Our Shareholders
On August 28, 2008, the worst thunderstorm in a generation 230 ripped through metropolitan Phoenix, toppling 150 power 199
poles and cutting off power to 80,000 APS customers. As the
storm clouds rolled in, our dedicated, hard-working employees
responded both quickly and effectively. Everyone called upon
in this emergency, including linemen, dispatchers, vegetation
crews, support personnel and managers worked around the 98 clock and restored power to virtually all customers before the
end of the Labor Day weekend.
The combined effort was efficient, impressive and often heroic. Over the years, Arizonans have come to expect this superb level of performance from our workforce. The storm response proved the validity of our processes and systems as well as
the dedication of our people. Our information technology 1988 1998 2008 infrastructure showed its worth as our network carried critical
information to the linemen in their service trucks, pinpointing
outages and prioritizing repairs to benefit the largest number APS Retail Customers
of customers. Served Per Employee It was a proud moment that again proved your company is
well-run and expertly operated.
THE ECONOMIC STORM + Now we are using that same reliance on our core strengths to weather a different kind of storm – a severe economic downturn that may surpass anything seen in our lifetimes. You know the story. Credit markets seized up, real estate prices fell, unemployment rose and consumers slowed their spending.
These global factors affect everyone and every company, and APS will continue to confront them. We have seen customer growth slow from three-to-four percent during the previous decade to just over one percent last year. Our real estate subsidiary, SunCor, has struggled amid declining real estate prices and tight credit markets.
But just as we were prepared for the worst thunderstorm in three decades, we are also solidly positioned to weather this economic storm.
When economic growth eventually returns to the U.S., Arizona’s economy will likely grow at a rate exceeding the nation as
a whole. Accordingly, we will prepare for the 21st century
economy by prudently investing in new technology and infrastructure to power resurgent growth. In keeping with our company’s traditions, we will maintain a competitive edge in energy efficiency, employee productivity and financial stability.
OUR STRONG FOUNDATION + When we say this is a well-run company, it is not marketing hype. By nearly any standard, we have made great strides in our operating performance. In 2008, we set a new company record for electric reliability, made more progress toward returning the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station to excellence and established new performance records for our fossil power stations. The Four Corners Power Plant, with an 86 percent capacity factor, and the Cholla Power Plant with 87 percent, both rank in the upper reaches of the top 25 percent of coal-fired power stations nationally.
During last summer’s peak demand periods, all three units at Palo Verde – the nation’s largest power producer – generated clean, inexpensive, uninterrupted power for 100 continuous days. For 2008, the plant achieved an overall capacity factor of 84 percent. Our Palo Verde team will accept nothing less than a full return to the top ranks of nuclear performance.
Our commitment to technology leads the industry in many areas including the accelerated installation of smart meters, an award-winning consumer Web site, and powerful new
tools for analyzing, predicting and responding to equipment problems. Last year, we won our industry’s most coveted honor, the Edison Electric Institute’s Edison Award, for developing state- of-the-art predictive tools that have the potential to virtually eliminate catastrophic failure of large transformers.
Technology in the hands of our skilled and motivated employees drives productivity. As a result of the effective use of technology and our employees’ outstanding work ethic, we have doubled our customer base over the last 20 years, while reducing our number of employees by 10 percent. We have established
new company records for reliability and increased customer satisfaction. Yet we have increased our residential prices only 11 percent since 1995, a mere one-fourth the rate of inflation.
In early 2008, we identified warning signs of the impending economic downturn and took appropriate measures to prepare for it. As a result, in 2008 APS eliminated about 300

 employee positions and cut operating budgets by $14 million. As the economic downturn became increasingly severe, we deferred more than $700 million of capital expenditure projects over the next several years, trimmed $50 million from our 2009 operating budget and are continuing workforce reductions of an additional 250 positions. We are confident we can continue to control expenses and improve cash flow consistent with our cost management culture.
Although our stock price declined 24 percent last year, the utility average declined 28 percent and the broader market 38 percent. In addition, our stock paid a dividend with an average yield over 6 percent for the last year.
In 2008, we produced nearly six times more electricity from renewable resources than we did in 2006. That is just the beginning. In February of 2008, we announced plans for the Solana Generating Station, the world’s largest solar power plant. When completed in 2012, this 280-megawatt concentrating solar facility will allow APS to provide more solar electricity per customer than any other major utility nationwide. We believe we are making sustained progress toward establishing Arizona as the Solar Capital of the World.
OUR RESOURCE PLAN + Building on our leadership in renewable energy, we have developed a comprehensive Resource Plan that envisions producing nearly half our customers’ new energy needs through 2025 with solar and other renewable energy sources. We are also working to help our customers improve
the energy efficiency of their homes and businesses.
This Resource Plan, prepared with a broad range of public input gathered from more than 120 meetings with more than 1,300 community leaders, constitutes a major step forward into Arizona’s energy future. Paying for major generating facilities like Solana will require broad public support, regulatory commitment and a strong financial position.
OUR REGULATORY PROGRESS + In the last few years, we have worked with our regulators to fashion a new regulatory environment. This environment has produced two base rate increases (including our first since 1991), a mechanism for
In keeping with our company’s traditions, we will maintain
a competitive edge
in energy efficiency, employee productivity and financial stability.
recovering fuel costs, a process for approving new generation and a method for recovering renewable and energy efficiency investments. For the first time in more than a decade, we
also received approval from federal regulators to increase transmission rates, and the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) approved recovery of those prices from retail customers.
In March of 2008, we filed a general rate case with the ACC. The request directly addresses the issue of earnings attrition and suggests several means to mitigate its effects. APS is also seeking higher levels of spending on energy efficiency and new pricing options that would allow customers to better manage their energy bills. That rate case is still pending before the ACC, and we anticipate a decision sometime in late 2009.
In December of last year, the ACC granted APS an interim
rate increase of $65 million, subject to refund if a decision in our general rate case results in a lower increase. We believe the Commission’s approval of this interim increase is a positive step that should help prevent the credit rating agencies from downgrading our debt ratings.
OUR PAST, OUR FUTURE + As we prepare for the return of economic and customer growth in Arizona, our priorities are to provide outstanding customer service, reasonable prices for customers and fair returns for investors. We can accomplish

  these priorities only if we have access to the capital markets on favorable terms. To further enhance our liquidity, we issued $500 million of long-term debt in February of 2009.
Especially during times of turmoil in the financial markets, it is essential that APS maintain its ability to access capital invest- ment – for conventional wires, new “smart” electric distribution technology and large-scale generating stations. Anything less could present a great risk to our company, our customers and our state’s future economy.
Looking ahead, we know there will be more storms to weather, more challenges to meet and more opportunities to capture. You can be assured, our stellar team will continue to approach each day with the vision, work ethic and integrity you have come to expect from Pinnacle West.
