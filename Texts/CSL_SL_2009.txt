2009 Carlisle Annual Report
To Our Shareholders
David A. Roberts,
Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
2009 was a challenging year as we encountered the most difficult economic period in recent memory. Our sales of $2,380 million were down 23%, compared to $3,110 million in 2008, and earnings before interest and income taxes (EBIT) were $207 million, an increase of 11% compared to $187 million in 2008. In spite of the sales decline we were able to increase our EBIT margins from 6.0% to 8.7% year-over-year and efficiently manage our businesses so that we generated $447 million in cash from operations. This enabled us to navigate through the economic storm of 2009 and exit the year in a very strong financial position. This excellent cash performance was the result of superb working capital management within each of our businesses. This cash enabled us to make long-term business investments such as the purchase of a new tire factory in Jackson, Tennessee, where we are consolidating three of our existing tire manufacturing plants into a world class facility that will allow us to serve our customers for years to come; the acquisitions of Jerrik and Electronic Cable Specialists, which expand our product offering, geographic reach and customer base in our interconnect technologies business; and the acquisition of the remaining interest in Japan Power Brake, allowing us to expand our global presence in our off-road braking business.
Our strong cash flow position also allowed us to reduce the borrowings against our revolving credit line and accounts receivable securitization program from $235 million at the end of 2008 to zero at the end of 2009. By reducing our dependence on this financing, we were able to decrease our 2009 interest expense by $19 million, as compared to the prior year. At the same time we contributed $53 million to our pension plans which has resulted in the qualified plan becoming funded. Our strong balance sheet and available credit lines poise us to take advantage of potential acquisitions and further invest in our core businesses while growing our revenue and expanding our earning margins. If there was ever a year not to be dependent upon the banks, 2009 was that year. Additionally, we increased our dividend to our shareholders for the 33rd consecutive year.

Five-Year Performance Graph
The table below shows how a $100 investment in Carlisle Companies Incorporated has grown over the five-year period ending December 31, 2009 as compared to a $100 investment in the S&P 500 Composite Index and the Peer Group Index.
The Peer Group Index includes Cooper Industries, Ltd., Crane Co., Danaher Corp., Dover Corp., Emerson Electric Co., General Electric, Harsco Corp., Illinois Tool Works Inc., Ingersoll-Rand Co., Ltd., ITT Corp., Parker Hannifin Corp., Pentair, Inc., Roper Industries, Inc., SPX Corp., Teleflex Inc., Textron Inc., and United Technologies Corp. The Company believes that these public companies have similar industrial characteristics and constitute an appro- priate index.
A significant contributor to improved margins during 2009, resulting in more than $20 million in cost savings, was the implementation of the Carlisle Operating System (COS). COS is our continuous improvement process that is based
on lean principles and is quickly becoming ingrained in the Carlisle culture. 2009 was our first full year that COS
was deployed enterprise-wide and is redefining the way we do business. Waste is being eliminated and efficiencies improved at every level, allowing us to increase our overall profitability. Our employees are becoming increasingly engaged in COS and have recognized that the role they play makes a significant difference in the overall success of Carlisle. In addition to the $20 million in cost savings, COS drove such significant change in our businesses that we were able to reduce factory space as our operations became more efficient and inventory requirements were reduced. In many cases we saw productivity increases of 20-30%, work-in-process inventory reductions of approximately 50% and square footage reductions of 50% due to COS. Improvements were not limited to production areas as COS enhanced new product development, engineering, purchasing, warranty, product rationalization and other areas. While we made progress in 2009, we are far from done. Similar savings are forecasted for 2010 as COS continues
to change the way Carlisle does business.
Using COS methodologies we took a critical look at the utilization of our facilities and found that we could do more with less. During the past two years we completed the closure of ten Carlisle tire and wheel distribution centers, con- solidating activities into our nine remaining centers. In the past twelve months, we closed two of our three California wheel plants, moving those operations into one facility in Ontario, California, and began the consolidation of six tire plants into three, with one of the remaining facilities being our new plant in Jackson, Tennessee. We consolidated two of our Chinese tire manufacturing facilities into our plant in Meizhou and closed one of our Buji plants. The Buji plant closure enabled us to transfer some of the products we were manufacturing in China back to our U.S. operations where our overall cost structure has become very competitive with Chinese manufacturing facilities.

                      COS productivity gains also drove other facility closings. Two Carlisle Interconnect Technologies plants in Washington State ceased operations, one in Tukwila, which has already closed, and another in Vancouver, which is scheduled
to close during the second quarter of 2010. Also, the industrial brake and friction plant in Logansport, Indiana, will close in mid-2010.
There was, however, a Trail King facility in Brookville, Pennsylvania, that we closed due to declining demand brought on by a slowing economy. The accumulated savings from all of the facility closings will be in excess of $40 million annually.
We were not able to find a viable buyer for Motion Control, our on-road heavy-duty friction and brake shoe manufacturer, which led to the liquidation of the business and brought an end to the operation’s monthly losses and cash consumption.
During the first quarter of 2010, we announced the further streamlining of our operations by the reorganization of our businesses into five segments. This allows us to, again, do more with less. We have eliminated the management position of Group President and each segment will be managed by a simpler, smaller and more focused Executive Team. The new segments will be:
Carlisle Construction Materials
Carlisle Engineered Transportation Solutions Carlisle Interconnect Technologies
Carlisle FoodService Products
Carlisle Specialty Products

Because the future will demand that we apply new ideas and approaches to all that we do, we continued to invest in our people during 2009. While other companies were cancelling or delaying development and training programs, we increased our emphasis on both. We are in the process of training all of our people in COS techniques, a strong area of focus for us throughout 2009.
While business levels dictated that we had to reduce our workforce in some areas, we increased the number of engineers that we employ. We feel that the future of our business hinges on new product development and designing products for specific markets and geographic regions.
We also continued to actively manage our company’s health care costs in 2009 through a company-wide program
we call the Carlisle National Medical and Wellness Plan. Through this plan our employees will manage their medical expenditures while taking advantage of preventative services. Additionally, we are increasing our employees’ awareness of medical costs and focusing them on preventive strategies.
Though some very experienced Board members retired over the past eighteen months, we strengthened our Board with the addition of Robert Bohn, Terry Growcock, Gregg Ostrander and Robin Adams. They represent sitting CEOs and a CFO of strong global companies, most larger than our own. Each of them will be a vital resource as Carlisle grows, expands globally, continues to be acquisitive and becomes more profitable.
We continue to work to breed a culture of continuous improvement, while empowering and encouraging decision- making at the local company level, close to the customer and by those who know their markets best. However, we leverage our corporate size when it helps our businesses and have developed a corporate-wide system to share best practices for the benefit of all of our operations.
 
 The Carlisle Operating System, our continuous improvement process based on lean principles, resulted in more than $20 million in cost savings during 2009 and is quickly becoming ingrained in the Carlisle culture.
 The “5-15-30-15-100 Vision,” introduced two years ago, remains our goal and becomes clearer with each step we take in building a better Carlisle. I believe our performance throughout 2010 and beyond will be dependent on our continued focus and execution of our five strategic priorities:
 The Vision - Building a Better Carlisle
$5 billion in sales
15% operating margins
30% of revenue outside the United States 15% return on invested capital
100% free cash conversion rate
Our operating management has demonstrated tremendous commitment towards these corporate initiatives. And our employees in every Carlisle company have shown enormous initiative and enthusiasm in building Carlisle for the future during a very difficult year.
We have ambitious goals - but we are resolute and pragmatic in how we plan to achieve them. We thank our customers, dealers, suppliers and investors for the trust that they have placed in us. We are ready for the challenges of 2010 and beyond...and the growth that will come from them.
