Dear fellow Williams shareholders,
This past year was one of strong financial results and transformative action that positioned Williams to be a leading supplier of energy infrastructure to our customers and growing dividends for our shareholders. In terms of our financial results, our infrastructure businesses performed very well in 2011, generating more than $2 billion in segment profit. Some of the key drivers of that success were a 7 percent increase in stable fee-based revenues and higher natural gas liquid (NGL) margins. We also continued to work on expanding our infrastructure businesses in all of our key areas, from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to the Marcellus Shale to our operations in Canada. When we think about the future of Williams, perhaps the most significant accomplishment of 2011 was completing the separation of our exploration and production business as WPX Energy. The spinoff transformed Williams into a highgrowth, high-dividend energy infrastructure company. This was a major accomplishment

that sets the stage for a new, significant era of growth at Williams. Our goal with the separation was to create two distinct, focused companies and maximize shareholder value. And since the announcement of the separation in early 2011, we've seen some of that shareholder value become unlocked; with the combined value of Williams and proportional WPX shares as of March 19, 2012, shareholder value has increased more than 30 percent despite spot natural gas prices declining more than 45 percent. When we look at what has happened in our industry over the past several years, we see an incredible amount of growth opportunities for Williams in both the near and longer term. Drilling efficiencies and advances in technology in North America's prolific shale plays have continued to lower the cost to produce natural gas. As a result, we've seen production levels stay relatively strong despite sustained low natural gas prices. Although we have recently seen some operators cut back drilling operations,

we would continue to expect relatively low natural gas prices for some time. Confidence in the industry's ability to develop vast supplies of relatively low cost shale gas is leading to increased demand in many areas like natural gas-fired power generation, and production of materials like steel, petrochemicals and fertilizer. The demand for natural gas in power generation is expanding even more rapidly than we expected a year ago. For example, power generation is the driver behind about a third of the volumes in proposed projects in development on Williams Partners' Transco pipeline. The renaissance in the U.S. petrochemical industry is being driven directly by lower natural gas prices. The reason is that in other parts of the world, the feedstock for petrochemicals are crude oil components. Here in North America, they can use natural gas liquid (NGL) feedstock instead which is much less expensive than their crude oil-based counterparts. The availability of abundant, relatively inexpensive feedstock right here in North America is creating a boom in petrochemical manufacturing. Of course, eventually this translates into more competitive U.S. manufacturing, more jobs and even an increase in exports. Now more than ever, there is a growing urgency for the infrastructure needed to deliver on the promise of the vast supply of natural gas in these new shale plays. Many of these new resources, the Marcellus and Utica shale for example, are in geographic areas that either have not been traditional energy-producing areas, or any infrastructure in place is not sufficient to meet current and future demand. Having infrastructure in place that can connect these vast new supplies of natural gas and NGLs to growing markets is vital.

Williams is extremely well positioned to help meet the soaring demand for large-scale infrastructure. First, producers are going to be looking for companies they can trust, and few companies have our long track record of successfully designing, building and operating the kind of assets required to capture the full value of North America's energy resources. We have more than $25 billion in potential projects identified through 2017. Many of these projects are capital-intensive, and they are certainly large-scale. A great example is our growth in the Marcellus Shale. Williams Partners has made a number of significant acquisitions along with organic expansions to grow our asset base. We're well on our way to reaching our goal of being the leading gathering, processing and transportation solution provider for producers in the Marcellus Shale: ·  We're building a major natural gas supply hub in northeastern Pennsylvania that is expected to deliver 3 Bcf/d of Marcellus production into four interstate gas pipeline systems ·  A new interstate gas pipeline, the Constitution Pipeline, will connect the Susquehanna Supply Hub with two other interstate pipelines in New York ·  The recently announced Caiman Eastern Midstream acquisition gives us a major footprint in the NGL-rich portion of the Marcellus Shale in northern West Virginia, southwestern Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio. It's also adjacent to the NGL-rich area of the Utica Shale, where we're currently working on developing infrastructure for producers

We also continue to expand our presence elsewhere, with several large growth projects under way in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, in the western United States as well as Canada. Our investments in Canada, as well as the planned expansion of our Geismar facility in Louisiana are part of our growing Midstream Canada & Olefins segment. We noted earlier that the petrochemical industry is in the midst of a renaissance ­ these expansions will help serve that booming industry. They will also help balance Williams' NGL commodity exposure, providing more stable future cash flows. Our unique operations in Canada, where we process oil-sands off gas to generate valuable energy products, also contribute to better air quality by reducing sulphur emissions and other greenhouse gases by thousands of tons per year. It's important to understand that with projects of this size and scope, we have to take the long view, and we firmly believe these projects are going to significantly benefit Williams and its shareholders in the long term. As excited as we are about the future, there are still challenges. Complex, contentious permitting is creating a new reality of unprecedented fluidity and variability in energy infrastructure design and construction. Simply put, the overlapping jurisdiction from too many local, state and federal regulating agencies have increased the delays, risk and costs of building new infrastructure. Ultimately the expense of this unwieldy regulation is borne by the public. Williams appreciates the need for regulation ­ indeed, we think that continuous improvement in standards and best practices is essential to our business success. However, we also believe that

a strict, but less complex, regulatory framework would greatly enhance the ability of the industry to deliver natural gas and NGLs and in the process drive a resurgence in our industrial base, increase jobs and help bolster the economy. Speaking of economic benefits, Williams is proud of its contributions to the communities where we have operations. In addition to our direct economic benefits, such as providing local jobs, paying state taxes, and leasing property, Williams has a strong commitment to add value to our communities. From New Jersey to the Gulf Coast, from New Mexico to Washington, Williams and its employees are active in local communities ­ making contributions to social, health and educational programs. We are very excited about Williams' future. We firmly believe that the vast natural resources in North America can and will be a transformative force in our domestic energy outlook. With our assets, expertise and excellent employee base with a proven track record of building and operating largescale energy infrastructure, we're one of the companies that is going to help make that transformation happen. Thank you for your continued support.

"We firmly believe that the vast natural resources in North America can and will be a transformative force in our domestic energy outlook."
