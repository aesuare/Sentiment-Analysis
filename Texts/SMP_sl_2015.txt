TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS,
After four consecutive years of record earnings, our streak came to an end in 2015. Both sales and our profit were down from 2014.
Obviously, we are disappointed in these results. However, much of the shortfall is the result of one-time events, and they are essentially behind us. Moreover, looking behind the financial results, we had many achievements in 2015, which, though not reflected in the numbers, will help us build for a stronger future.
First, let’s look at sales. Our customers reported solid sales increases in our lines in 2015—up 3% in Engine Management, matching industry growth trends, and up 10% in Temperature Control, thanks to the first warm summer in three years.
However, this was not reflected in their purchases from us, which were down about one percent (actually, excluding the effect of the decline in the Canadian dollar, they were flat). Over time, customer purchases and sales will balance out, but in the short term they can be different. In 2014, for example, there were some large pipeline orders to customers which were not repeated in 2015. Further, we believe that many customers took advantage of the strong air conditioning season in 2015 to reduce inventories left over from the prior two cool summers.
Looking forward, we forecast sales increases in the low single digits, in line with industry trends—though Temperature Control sales will vary up or down from that, depending on the weather.
Turning to profit, the bulk of the shortfall—approximately $10 million—resulted from three specific events which are essentially behind us. The three were: unfavorable manufacturing variances in Temperature Control that carried forward into 2015; costs relating to enhancing our line of remanufactured diesel fuel injectors (a product line which we believe has a promising future); and costs related to the termination of our post-retirement medical program at the end of 2016. With these behind us, we anticipate significant improvements in 2016.
In addition, we have taken several steps to build a stronger company for the future. Here are some of them:
• We have substantially increased our budget for in-house manufacturing, including both people and capital investment. We are now manufacturing millions of dollars of products that we formerly purchased. The benefits, in addition to substantial cost savings, include improved quality and more reliable delivery.
• We continue to invest in and upgrade our recent acquisitions. In addition to the diesel fuel injectors, mentioned above, we are currently building a new facility in Foshan, China for our joint venture with Gwo Yng. We anticipate improvements in cost and efficiency for this operation, and we expect Gwo Yng be a major contributor to our Temperature Control business in the years ahead.
• We continue to expand our facilities in low cost countries—China, Mexico, and Poland. We recently announced that we will be closing a factory in Grapevine, Texas over the next two years, with jobs being transferred to other SMP locations in the U.S. and abroad. Once the move is complete, by the end of 2017, we anticipate annual savings of $6-7 million.
These are the hardest decisions we ever have to make, as they affect our people. But we feel they are necessary to enable us to compete with low priced imports from China and other countries in Asia. Needless to say, we do everything possible to help the people involved, by giving many months of advance notice, and offering severance payments, extended medical coverage, and assistance in finding positions in other SMP locations.
Our cash flow remains strong. In 2015, we generated cash from operations of $65 million. In keeping with our strategy of returning cash to shareholders, we recently announced an

increase in our quarterly dividend from 15 cents to 17 cents. In January 2016 we completed our $20 million share buyback program, implemented in 2015, representing roughly 562,000 shares repurchased.
Finally, at the end of the year, we announced a management change. Effective March 31, 2016, Larry Sills, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer since 2000, will become Executive Chairman, and Eric Sills currently President, will become Chief Executive Officer. Eric will be only the fourth Chief Executive Officer in our Company’s 97 year history. We believe that this long tradition of management continuity and stability is one of the major reasons for our success.
In addition, John Gethin, who has been with the company since 1995, and has made significant contributions in his roles as President and Chief Operating Officer, is retiring. Fortunately, he will continue to be associated with the Company, as he will be joining our Board of Directors and will serve as an outside consultant. At the same time, Arthur Sills and Peter Sills will be retiring from the Board, and will become Directors Emeritus.
The Office of the Chief Executive will now consist of Eric Sills, Chief Executive Officer and President; Jim Burke, Executive Vice President Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Dale Burks, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.
We believe that these changes will lead to a very smooth transition and a very strong leadership team to carry the Company into the future, as we approach our 100th anniversary.
In conclusion, while we are disappointed in our financial results for the year, we remain optimistic about the future. Our one-time issues are behind us. Industry demographics are healthy—the average age of vehicles continues to rise, gas prices remain low, and miles driven are up. Our customers report solid sales increases in our lines, and our position in the marketplace has never been stronger. We continue to take steps to grow our sales, reduce our costs, and improve profitability going forward. We look forward to 2016 and beyond.
