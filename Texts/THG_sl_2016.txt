 To Our Shareholders,
2016 was a year of important progress for our company. Our businesses performed well in the face of significant market challenges and
we advanced our mission to deliver value for our stakeholders.
Our performance during the year affirmed the time is right to take our company to the next level. We reported operating income of $4.27 per share, which included
a balance sheet strengthening in the fourth quarter, ensuring that we continue to build on a solid financial foundation. We delivered substantially improved underlying operating income compared to 2015, excluding domestic balance sheet strengthening, and improved
our accident year loss ratios, as we have over the past several years. Each of our businesses generated solid underlying results during 2016, reflecting our inherent strengths and unique competitive position.
At the same time, we developed our go-forward business strategy, Hanover 2021, committing to
build on our proven, agent-centric strategy, expand our industry- leading domestic and international specialty capabilities, and create innovative, technology-based business models to help our agent partners and our company grow. We are confident that the successful implementation of this strategy will generate significant increases in
revenues and book value
per share while producing top-quartile returns on equity over the next five years.
With our organization financially stronger and better positioned than ever, we look forward to providing our partners and customers with exceptional insurance solutions
in a dynamic world and delivering superior returns for our shareholders.
