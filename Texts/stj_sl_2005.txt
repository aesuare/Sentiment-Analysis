Identity® ADx Pacemaker
The Identity® ADx pacemaker family, which includes the world’s smallest dual-chamber pacemaker, provides clinicians with advanced pacemaker technology, including the AF SuppressionTM algorithm, the first algorithm clinically proven to suppress atrial
fibrillation (AF).
   This 2005 report to shareholders reviews the following highlights:
• St. Jude Medical’s 2005 financial results. We are reaching more people around the world to help them in meaningful ways through our medical technology and services. Our financial results for 2005 reflect the impact we are having globally.
• The strong performance and competitiveness of our cardiac rhythm management (CRM) growth platform. The impressive results in our cardiac rhythm management business confirm that we are doing the right things to help patients impacted by heart rhythm disorders, and we expect more growth to come.
• Our programs to sustain future growth. We pay as much attention to sustaining our success long term as we do to ensuring that we deliver outstanding annual results. In 2005, we made important progress building our atrial fibrillation (AF) and cardiology businesses, while adding an additional potential long-term growth platform outside the cardiovascular market with the acquisition of Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, Inc. (ANS), a chronic pain management and neurostimulation company.
2005 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
St. Jude Medical reported record sales in 2005 of $2.9 billion, a 27% increase over 2004. This caps a five-year history where the compound annual growth rate of our sales has averaged 21.3%.
Our 2005 gross profit margin of 72.7% of sales improved a full 2.3 percentage points over 2004, underscoring our commitment to operating excellence and continuous improvement. This compares to a gross profit margin that was only 63.3% as recently as 1998.
Cash provided by operating activities reached $716 million for 2005, an 18.5% increase over 2004. Since 2000, our cash flow from operations has increased at an annual compounded rate of 28.5% providing us with the financial capacity to fund our multiple growth initiatives.
In short, 2005 was another excellent year of performance and investment for the future at St. Jude Medical. And we aren’t finished yet.

CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT GROWTH PLATFORM
Our cardiac rhythm management program, which has been our primary growth platform in recent years, grew strongly again in 2005 and is well positioned for continued growth.
Total sales for St. Jude Medical grew approximately $621 million from 2004 to 2005, with 73% of this growth (approximately $451 million) coming from our CRM business. Sales of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) totaled more than $1 billion this past year, growing 72% over 2004. We estimate that we captured
5 points of global ICD market share during 2005 and held an estimated 20%
of the worldwide ICD market during the second half of 2005.
What will continue to drive St. Jude Medical’s market share gains in ICDs? There are three key answers.
• Right market. We are one of only three major participants in a market that was about $5.6 billion in 2005 and is expected to grow on average 20% over the next few years.
• Right products and pipeline. We have been investing 12-13% of total corporate revenues in research and development (R&D) to maintain an outstanding flow
of new technology and products long term. A large portion of this investment has been in our CRM program where we expect to launch over 20 new products in 2006 — the largest launch year ever in our Company’s history. We also supplement our internal R&D with additional investment as appropriate, such as our acquisition of Savacor, Inc. in 2005. Savacor develops heart failure diagnostics and therapy guidance products and technologies that may benefit our cardiac rhythm management program.
• Right people. In addition to high-caliber employees within our operating divisions, our U.S. and International Divisions have extremely effective field sales and service organizations, which conduct themselves with the highest level of professionalism and service.
  
< FRANK KINNEY, A RETIRED UTILITIES COMPANY EXECUTIVE AND AVID GOLFER, WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HEART FAILURE SEVERAL YEARS AGO AFTER EXPERIENCING EXTREME FATIGUE AND DIFFICULTY WALKING. HE ALSO SUFFERED FROM ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, WHICH OFTEN ACCOMPANIES HEART FAILURE. AFTER BEING TREATED WITH MEDICATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS, FRANK RECEIVED ST. JUDE MEDICAL’S ATLAS®+ HF CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY (CRT) DEVICE, WHICH COMBINES PACEMAKER AND DEFIBRILLATION THERAPY WITH BI-VENTRICULAR STIMULATION TO TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF HEART FAILURE. SINCE THE IMPLANT, FRANK HAS ENTHUSIASTICALLY RESUMED HIS GOLF GAME AND ENJOYS ANNUAL TRIPS TO FLORIDA WITH HIS WIFE, MAUREEN.

> WALTER CALDWELL HAD BEEN RAISING CATTLE OUTSIDE ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA, FOR OVER 35 YEARS WHEN AN ERRATIC HEART RHYTHM BEGAN MAKING HIM EXHAUSTED, UNABLE TO EVEN CARRY A SMALL PIECE OF WOOD. HE WAS PLACED ON MEDICINE,
BUT DID NOT IMPROVE, AND HE EVENTUALLY HAD TO GIVE UP HIS CATTLE BUSINESS. IN EARLY 2005, WALTER UNDERWENT A SURGICAL CARDIAC ABLATION PROCEDURE USING ST. JUDE MEDICAL’S EPICORTM CARDIAC ABLATION SYSTEM. TODAY HE LOVES CHOPPING WOOD, DOING CHORES, AND CHASING HIS GRANDSON AROUND THE HOUSE.
   EpicorTM Cardiac Ablation System
The EpicorTM Cardiac Ablation System’s unique high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) technology allows physicians to safely and effectively ablate cardiac tissue from the outside of a beating heart without placing patients on a heart-lung bypass machine. Using this less-invasive approach, physicians deliver HIFU energy across the wall of the heart to create very precise and contiguous lines of cardiac tissue ablation.

 < FU GUO-LIN TAKES PRIDE IN HIS WORK AS A PHOTOJOURNALIST IN CHINA, BUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO HIS CAREER WAS INTERRUPTED BY A SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEM. GUO-LIN WAS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH
A HIGH FEVER AND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH ENDOCARDITIS, AN INFECTION
OF THE HEART USUALLY CAUSED BY BACTERIA. DOCTORS IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TREATING HIM WITH ANTIBIOTICS, BUT WHEN HE DID NOT RESPOND, THEY PERFORMED OPEN-HEART SURGERY AND REPLACED HIS SEVERELY DAMAGED AORTIC VALVE WITH A ST. JUDE MEDICAL® MECHANICAL VALVE. JUST ONE MONTH AFTER THE SURGERY, GUO-LIN WAS ABLE TO RETURN TO THE WORK HE LOVED.
In 2005, St. Jude Medical strengthened its CRM program, building on the strong market acceptance of the Atlas®+ HF and Epic® HF cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-Ds) for heart failure patients. Our achievements included the launch of St. Jude Medical’s first ICDs in Japan, the world’s second-largest medical technology market; U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the Frontier® II low-voltage device for cardiac resynchronization therapy pacing (CRT-P) for certain heart failure patients; U.S. and European launch of the QuickSite® Bipolar CRT lead; FDA approval of expanded capabilities for the Housecall PlusTM ICD remote monitoring system; and U.S. launch of the IsoFlex® P (polyurethane) pacing lead.
These highlights point to one conclusion: Our CRM growth platform is successful because we do the right things every day to help patients impacted by heart rhythm disorders...and our results prove it.
PROGRAMS TO SUSTAIN OUR SUCCESS
ATRIAL FIBRILLATION In 2005, we made important progress in our atrial fibrillation business, which is on track to become a major additional growth driver for St. Jude Medical. Atrial fibrillation is the world’s most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting more than 6 million people worldwide. After heart failure, AF represents the largest unmet clinical need in cardiovascular medicine today.
In 2005, we estimate that the number of AF ablation procedures performed in the United States grew to 40,000, up from 26,000 procedures in 2004. Still, this means that less than 2% of the population with AF is currently being treated with curative therapies.
We believe St. Jude Medical is uniquely positioned to develop new approaches for diagnosing, treating, and potentially curing this widespread and often debilitating disease. Through the creation of a focused AF Division in 2005, as well as recent acquisitions and internal development, we anticipate strengthening our position in the fast-growing emerging AF market.
  1994
> IN 1994, ST. JUDE MEDICAL ACQUIRED CALIFORNIA-BASED PACESETTER, INC., THE CARDIAC PACING BUSINESS OF GERMANY’S SIEMENS AG. THIS ACQUISITION
— WHICH MORE THAN DOUBLED ST. JUDE MEDICAL’S SALES AND TRIPLED ITS WORK FORCE — MARKED THE COMPANY’S ENTRY INTO THE CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT MARKET. TODAY, CARDIAC RHYTHM MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO ST. JUDE MEDICAL’S REVENUES AND HAVE BEEN THE COMPANY’S PRIMARY GROWTH DRIVER IN RECENT YEARS.

   1996
> IN 1996, ST. JUDE MEDICAL DIVERSIFIED FURTHER WITH THE ACQUISITION OF MINNESOTA-BASED DAIG CORPORATION, A COMPANY OFFERING A BROAD PORTFOLIO
OF SOPHISTICATED INTRODUCERS AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY CATHETERS FOR MAPPING AND TREATING CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS. THIS BUSINESS QUICKLY GAINED A REPUTATION FOR RAPID PRODUCT DEPLOYMENT, STATE-OF-THE-ART MANUFACTURING, AND EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN MANY OF ITS PRODUCT LINES. TO ROUND OUT ITS OFFERINGS, ST. JUDE MEDICAL SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED THE ANGIO-SEALTM VASCULAR CLOSURE DEVICE, PROVIDING PHYSICIANS WITH INNOVATIVE TOOLS FOR THE BEGINNING AND END OF CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION PROCEDURES.
8
Our 2005 annual product sales for AF and other electrophysiology (EP) procedures were up 62% over 2004. This success reflected strong performance across a broad range of products, including sophisticated catheters, 3-D mapping and navigation systems, and surgical ablation technologies.
We achieved several milestones in 2005, including a limited launch of the EpicorTM Cardiac Ablation System, which delivers a high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) energy to ablate cardiac tissue. The EpicorTM System, which includes the UltraCinchTM Ablation Device and the UltraWandTM Handheld Ablation Device, is placed on the outside of a beating heart, allowing physicians to perform surgery without placing the patient on a heart-lung bypass machine.
In 2005, data from a multi-center study on the Epicor System, published in the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (JTCVS), showed that at the six month follow-up, 85% of patients in the study group remained free from
atrial fibrillation.
Several innovative products for electrophysiology procedures were introduced by St. Jude Medical this past year to help support our continued growth, including:
• The EnSite® System Version 5.1 with enhanced capabilities, representing a significant advance in 3-D navigation and visualization technology, and the EnSite® Verismo Segmentation Tool, which uses CT and MRI scans to build 3-D models of cardiac anatomy; and
• The high-power IBI-1500T6 Cardiac Ablation Generator, delivering up to 100 watts of radio-frequency power, and two TherapyTM EP catheters, expanding our ablation technology portfolio in the United States.
  
< SUSANNE SCHWANDT, OF STUTTGART, GERMANY, SUDDENLY BECAME ILL IN 2005, SUFFERING ACUTE VISION LOSS AND LOSING SOME OF HER ABILITY TO SPEAK. AFTER AN AMBULANCE RUSHED HER
TO THE HOSPITAL, DOCTORS DETERMINED SHE HAD A PATENT FORAMEN OVALE (PFO), A SMALL HOLE BETWEEN THE HEART’S UPPER CHAMBERS. DOCTORS USED ST. JUDE MEDICAL’S PREMERETM PFO CLOSURE SYSTEM TO CLOSE SUSANNE’S PFO, A CONDITION THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN STROKES OR MIGRAINE HEADACHES. SHE’S HAD NO SYMPTOMS SINCE THE PROCEDURE AND CAN ENJOY SPORTS, TRAVELING, AND TIME WITH HER TWO YOUNG CHILDREN.
  PremereTM PFO Closure System
The PremereTM PFO Closure
System was designed specifically for the closure of patent foramen ovale, a common heart defect where a small hole between the heart’s upper chambers (atria) fails to close in infancy. An estimated 25% of the adult population has a PFO, which is usually considered benign but may be associated
with certain strokes and migraine headaches. In 2006, St. Jude Medical launched the ESCAPE clinical trial to study the potential connection between PFO closure and a reduction of migraine headaches.
CARDIOLOGY We followed through on our commitment in 2005 to make targeted investments to expand our cardiology business. During the year, we completed the acquisition of Velocimed, LLC, adding three new products for interventional cardiologists: the PremereTM PFO Closure System, the ProxisTM Embolic Protection System, and the VentureTM Wire Control catheter.
We initiated the ESCAPE (Effect of Septal Closure of Atrial PFO on Events of Migraine with Premere) clinical trial in early 2006 to examine the potential connection between PFO (patent foramen ovale) closure and migraines. A PFO is a small hole between the heart’s upper chambers that fails to close in about 25% of the adult population. Medical researchers have observed that patients whose PFOs have been closed appear to have less recurrence of strokes, and anecdotal evidence suggests that PFO closure may also reduce the incidence of migraines.
In 2005, we announced the results from St. Jude Medical’s PROXIMAL clinical trial showing that the ProxisTM System, which is deployed proximal (“upstream”)
to a lesion, was as effective as distal (“downstream”) protection devices as measured by major adverse cardiac events (MACE) 30 days after the procedure. The ProxisTM device is designed to protect a blood vessel from debris dislodged during interventional procedures.
We also launched the VentureTM Wire Control catheter in the United States in 2005. This catheter can be used to navigate guidewires through many difficult cardiac anatomies, including chronic total occlusions (complete blood vessel obstruction), helping interventional cardiologists access and treat lesions that are difficult to reach.
These products and programs will broaden our Cardiology Division’s portfolio, building on the success of our industry-leading Angio-SealTM vascular closure device. Angio-SealTM has been an important contributor to St. Jude Medical’s revenues and growth in recent years. To date, we have shipped more than 6 million Angio-SealTM devices, underscoring the overwhelming market acceptance this product has enjoyed.

ALICIA PARKS WAS PUZZLED BY THE SHARP, SHOOTING SENSATIONS IN HER LEG AND BACK, BUT AS THE “EXCRUCIATING PAIN” PERSISTED, SHE SOUGHT MEDICAL CARE. AN MRI REVEALED SEVERE BACK PROBLEMS AND DOCTORS RECOMMENDED SURGERY. ALICIA WAS HESITANT, BUT WHEN OTHER TREATMENTS FAILED, INCLUDING INTENSIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY AND MULTIPLE PAIN MEDICATIONS, SHE RELUCTANTLY AGREED. UNFORTUNATELY, THE PAIN CONTINUED AFTER THE SURGERY, SO ALICIA’S DOCTOR IMPLANTED THE EONTM NEUROSTIMULATION SYSTEM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO MANAGE CHRONIC BACK AND LEG PAIN. ALICIA FEELS “SO MUCH BETTER” AND SAYS THAT THE IMPLANT HAS “GIVEN ME MY LIFE BACK.”
 EonTM Neurostimulation System
The EonTM Neurostimulation System is used to manage chronic, intractable pain of the trunk and limbs. Compatible with the full line of ANS leads, the EonTM system offers an extensive array of configuration, programming, and placement options, allowing clinicians to customize therapy to meet each patient’s specific needs.

“I can tell already it has given me my life back.”
 NEUROMODULATION The acquisition of Advanced Neuromodulation Systems, which was completed in November 2005, provides an attractive, additional growth platform for St. Jude Medical. The neuromodulation market is a large ($1 billion), fast-growing, and under-penetrated segment of the medical device industry, representing enormous long-term growth potential. ANS is a technology leader in this market with a strong No. 2 position in spinal cord stimulation to manage chronic pain.
Neuromodulation is the delivery of very small, precise doses of electricity or drugs to the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, or other parts of the nervous system to treat conditions caused by nerve damage or other nervous system disorders.
The technologies used in pacemakers and in neurostimulation systems are extremely complementary. One typical neuromodulation system consists of an implantable pulse generator that delivers electrical stimulation and leads that connect a pulse generator to the targeted therapy area along the spinal cord. The ANS technologies complement our cardiac rhythm management expertise in microelectronics, batteries, leads, and programmers, which should benefit the flow of new products in
both organizations.
An exciting aspect of neuromodulation technology lies in the potential for new applications. ANS already has clinical studies underway in the areas of Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor, conditions that affect almost 7 million people in the United States alone. In the future, neuromodulation therapy may also be used
to treat such widespread conditions as depression, migraine headaches, obesity, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and angina.
  1997
> ST. JUDE MEDICAL ENTERED
THE IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER DEFIBRILLATOR (ICD) BUSINESS
IN 1997 WITH ITS ACQUISITION
OF CALIFORNIA-BASED VENTRITEX INC. TODAY, ICD SALES — WHICH INCREASED 72% IN 2005 — ARE
A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE COMPANY’S OVERALL GROWTH. ICDs DELIVER LIFE-SAVING THERAPY BY SHOCKING THE HEART OUT OF DANGEROUS, POTENTIALLY FATAL ARRHYTHMIAS AND, MORE RECENTLY, ALSO HAVE BEEN USED TO TREAT HEART FAILURE PATIENTS THROUGH CARDIAC RESYNCHRONIZATION THERAPY.

“I’m back to rebuilding antique cars.”
 BUILDING ON A RICH HERITAGE
CARDIAC SURGERY St. Jude Medical’s growth opportunities build on the Company’s rich heritage as a medical technology pioneer and global innovator.
The Company was founded in 1976 around a highly profitable mechanical heart valve business. This business has enjoyed unparalleled success, producing the industry’s gold standard mechanical heart valve and enjoying market and technology leadership for 30 years, an accomplishment rarely seen in an industry known
for constant and rapid change.
In 2005, we strengthened our tissue valve and heart valve repair product lines and were pleased with the successful U.S. launch of our SJM Biocor® stented tissue valve. This valve has a well-established track record of outstanding clinical performance worldwide in both the aortic and mitral valve positions. We expect continued revenue growth and strengthening of our stented tissue valve business in 2006 and beyond.
  
< AFTER SHERRILL LOFTIN BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND SEVERE STOMACH PAINS, HE WAS FORCED TO GIVE UP HIS DAILY WALKS. DOCTORS DISCOVERED A CONDITION CALLED BICUSPID AORTIC VALVE — WHICH PREVENTED HIS AORTIC VALVE LEAFLETS FROM OPENING BECAUSE OF SEVERE CALCIFICATION — AND RECOMMENDED HEART VALVE REPLACEMENT SURGERY. IN 2005, SHERRILL RECEIVED ST. JUDE MEDICAL’S BIOCOR® HEART VALVE, THE COMPANY’S FIRST U.S. STENTED TISSUE VALVE. SHERRILL HAS RETURNED TO WORK AND REBUILDS ANTIQUE CARS IN HIS SPARE
TIME, WHILE ENJOYING LIFE WITH HIS WIFE, FIVE CHILDREN, EIGHT GRANDCHILDREN, AND ONE GREAT-GRANDCHILD (WITH ANOTHER ON THE WAY)!
 WELL POSITIONED TO SUSTAIN OUR SUCCESS
We are pleased with our business achievements in 2005, which were recognized by several national publications, including FORTUNE Magazine, which named
St. Jude Medical one of its “Most Admired Companies”; Forbes Magazine, which selected us as the “Best Managed Healthcare Equipment and Services” company; and Medical Device & Diagnostic Industry, which chose the Company as “Medical Device Manufacturer of the Year” (large company).
