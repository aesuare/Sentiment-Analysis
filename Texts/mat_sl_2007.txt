TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Considering the challenges we faced in 2007, your company performed well. As promised, in 2008 the company will continue to make progress addressing the issues we faced as an industry last year, and as such, I believe Mattel is
in a strong position to achieve sustainable, improved performance. YOU HAVE OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE AND IMPROVE OUR BUSINESS, AS WELL AS THE OVERALL TOY INDUSTRY, both in terms of what we achieve, financially, and how we achieve it, responsibly.
Much has been written about last year’s toy recalls.
In fact, some analysts and media pundits dubbed 2007 as the “Year of the Recall.” Although the recalls only impacted a very small fraction of our products, we do take full responsibility for having every one of our products not only be safe, but also meet all required standards around the globe.
As I said last year, I hope we are remembered not for the issues that we faced, but instead for how we responded
to the challenge. In a public relations crisis like the one we faced in 2007, an organization’s deep-seated, true core values are revealed. I saw a genuine commitment, collectively from the 30,000-person-strong Mattel organization, to do
the right thing, every time. PUT SIMPLY, I COULDN’T BE MORE PROUD TO BE PART OF MATTEL AND TO WORK ALONGSIDE THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THIS GREAT COMPANY.
Globally, Mattel delivered a 6 percent increase in net
revenues in 2007. While the U.S. business was down slightly, in international markets we experienced double-digit growth across almost all major regions. As in any year, some properties increased while others declined, but we did see strong performance across many areas of our portfolio, includingcoreFisher-Price® andtoysbasedonthe Disney/Pixar CARS entertainment property. Despite the costs associated with the product recalls, we were also able to achieve improvements in gross margin and overall profitability.
Your Board of Directors thoughtfully and aggressively deployed capital last year. We acquired the Polly Pocket® brand – a property we had licensed for years – and several
® board games, including the popular Apples to Apples.
The dividend was increased by 15 percent to $0.75 per share, and we repurchased 35.9 million shares of our stock, representing 9 percent of shares outstanding.
 
All told, your Board deployed more than $1 billion of excess cash in 2007.
Going forward, we will continue to make strategic acquisitions
when there is a sound financial rationale based on reasonable
expectations and we believe the business can integrate well
with our company. This approach has served us well with the
®®®
Radica, Polly Pocket and Apples to Apples acquisitions.
We will also return funds to you via dividends, and, from time to time, share repurchases. Over the past five years, we have paid shareholders more than $1 billion in dividends and repurchased $2 billion of our common stock. WE HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED AND OPPORTUNISTIC ABOUT DEPLOYING OUR CAPITAL, AND YOU HAVE OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE DOING SO IN THE YEARS AHEAD.
In 2008, we are committed to continuing to grow the business. While many are anxious about consumer sentiment and potentially choppy economic waters ahead, the toy business has historically performed relatively well during tough times. Additionally, on top of our portfolio
of industry leading brands, we expect strong performances
from toys associated with several of this summer’s likely
TM TM blockbuster movies: Speed Racer, Kung Fu Panda and
TM
Batman® The Dark Knight. Our International business
has grown at a double-digit compounded annual growth rate since the beginning of the decade, and the structure, management team, plans and programs are in place to quickly realize our near-term goal of having sales outside the U.S. contribute more than half of our total revenues.
From a margin perspective, we are experiencing higher
costs this year in many areas, including commodities, labor and quality testing. While there can always be temporary dislocations, we are committed to pricing our products appropriately and reducing controllable costs – just as we did last year – to address cost pressures and improve profitability.
We are also committed to exercising our leadership position in the toy industry. In quality control, for example, WE’VE DEVELOPED NEW, MORE STRINGENT STANDARDS AND HAVE OPENLY SHARED THEM WITH OTHER MANUFACTURERS. We’ve engaged with regulatory bodies around the world
to strengthen systems designed to maintain consumer confidence in toys. And we’ve partnered with retailers
to rekindle growth in their toy departments.
WE HAVE CONTINUED OUR COMMITMENT TO STRENGTHEN OUR EFFORTS AS A RESPONSIBLE CORPORATE CITIZEN
WITH THE CREATION OF A NEW CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY ORGANIZATION reporting directly to me. The organization is tasked with continuing and enhancing the company’s leadership role in this area by adding a new level of accountability to Mattel’s safety and compliance protocols; managing implementation and oversight of the company’s Global Manufacturing Principles; and coordinating and progressing green initiatives on a global scale.
We also continue to be committed to the personal and professional development of our employees. In fact, this year, FORTUNE MAGAZINE NAMED MATTEL TO THE HIGHLY COVETED “100 BEST COMPANIES TO WORK FOR” LIST – an acknowledge- ment of a belief I have had since my very first day on the job.
At the board level, Dean Scarborough, chief executive officer of Avery Dennison, and Vasant Prabhu, chief financial officer of Starwood Hotels, joined Mattel’s Board of Directors,
and we are already benefiting from their valuable insights. Tully Friedman, whose leadership we’ve enjoyed for years, was formally elected lead independent director last May.
Finally, I AM PROUD OF OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE LIVE, WORK AND PLAY. This year, the Mattel Children’s Foundation celebrates 30 years of “making a meaningful difference, one child at a time.” And it was 10 years ago this year that Mattel made the unprecedented $25 million commitment toward the building of a new children’s hospital at the University of California, Los Angeles campus. The Mattel Children’s Hospital at UCLA opens its doors this spring and expects to serve more than 100,000 critically ill children each year.
Abraham Lincoln once said: COMMITMENT IS WHAT TRANSFORMS A PROMISE INTO REALITY. I made a promise to parents across the globe – that Mattel toys will not only be great, but also safe. And it is our collective commitment to you, our shareholders and owners of the company,
that we will make good on that promise as we continue to realize our vision of being the World’s Premier Toy Brands – Today and Tomorrow.
