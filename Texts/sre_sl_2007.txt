Fellow Shareholders, In 2007, we not only exceeded our financial goals, but we also strengthened the foundation for our continued growth in the future.
We generated record income from continuing operations in 2007 of $1.13 billion, or $4.26 per diluted share, up from $1.09 billion, or $4.17 per diluted share, in 2006. Our total shareholder return in 2007 was 13 percent. These results continue a trend of growth in shareholder value that, in 2007, led to Sempra Energy® being named for the first time to the "BusinessWeek 50" list of top-performing U.S. companies. The company was also recognized in Fortune magazine's "America's Most Admired Companies" list in 2007 and again in 2008, ranking No. 2 among electric and gas utilities in 2008. But markets continue to change. That is why we have focused our investment strategy over the last several years on North American natural gas infrastructure and our California utilities. These are the areas where we believe we can produce the most stable financial returns for our shareholders. Another key part of our strategy centers on an agreement that we reached in July 2007 with The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), one of the largest banks in the world, to form a joint venture that will allow us to expand our commoditiesmarketing business significantly while capping our risk. The importance of this new partnership -- in which RBS will provide all growth capital, workingcapital requirements and credit support -- cannot be overstated. Finalized in April 2008, the partnership lays the

groundwork for us to expand our existing product lines and move into new markets -- while greatly reducing our risk profile. This transaction will enable us to benefit from continued growth in the commodities business while freeing up the company's balance sheet to repurchase common shares and increase our dividend. During the past year, we made considerable progress on our major infrastructure projects. When Energía Costa Azul comes online in 2008, it will be the first liquefied natural gas (LNG) receipt terminal on the west coast of North America. The Baja California, Mexico, facility will serve electricity-generating plants, industry and utilities in northern Mexico and the U.S. Southwest.

While LNG represents an important emerging natural gas supply for the United States, Sempra Energy also is committed to improving the domestic pipeline system for bringing gas to market. We are partners with Kinder Morgan and ConocoPhillips in the Rockies Express Pipeline, a 1,600-mile pipeline that will deliver natural gas

from the Rocky Mountain basins to the northeastern United States. About half of the project is now operational; the rest should be completed in 2009. Renewable-energy development is a growing focus, and in 2007, Sempra Energy announced its first renewable-energy project, located in Baja California's La Rumorosa area. The project, which will produce wind power for the California market, could be operational by 2011. Our two California utilities, San Diego Gas & Electric® (SDG&E®) and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas®), continue to set a high standard of service, supplying reliable and safe energy to more than 23 million Californians. In 2007, we completed construction of a new 52-mile transmission loop around urban San Diego to improve reliability and access to new power plants. We also continue to push for timely regulatory approval of the Sunrise Powerlink project, which would be the first major new
(continued on page 6)

Our second LNG terminal, Cameron LNG, on the Gulf Coast of Louisiana, is targeted for completion at the end of 2008. The Cameron LNG facility is only 35 miles from a major pipeline hub that provides access to nearly two-thirds of all U.S. natural gas markets. In the same region, our Liberty Gas Storage facility will begin operations in 2008, providing added flexibility for LNG shippers, producers, local industrial end users and utilities in the market.

high-voltage transmission line in nearly 25 years that connects San Diego to the state's energy grid. We believe the Sunrise Powerlink is the most effective way to improve energy reliability, reduce costs and meet California's mandates for increased renewable energy and reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. Both lines are a vital part of SDG&E's long-term energy plan, which encompasses a balanced mix of energy conservation, renewable resources and new power plants and transmission lines. As we execute our strategy, we are mindful of the escalating concerns about global warming and the future regulation of greenhouse gases. We have taken an environmentally responsible approach in all our businesses. Natural gas is the cleanest of all fossil fuels, and we expect it will play a critical role as a bridge to a "greener" future as renewable sources, such as solar, wind and biomass, become a growing part of North America's energy mix. Our power-generating facilities at Sempra Generation and SDG&E employ the latest clean-burning natural gas technology to keep emissions low. Additionally, our utilities have been recognized nationally for their leadership in energy efficiency, and SDG&E is working aggressively to contract for new renewable resources. The Sunrise Powerlink will serve as a key transmission gateway to import energy from renewable sources into the San Diego region. I look at the road ahead with great optimism. In my 36 years at this company, I've never been more excited about our ability to create long-term value for our shareholders. Our joint venture with RBS is an important

part of it. The transaction immediately will strengthen our balance sheet and provide the flexibility to pursue additional growth opportunities in the future. In 2008, we also expect to begin realizing earnings contributions from several of our major infrastructure projects as they begin commercial operations. Also, in 2008, we mark the 10-year anniversary of Sempra Energy's founding. We are a very different company today, with a balanced portfolio of regulated utility and competitive energy businesses, a pipeline of high-quality development projects and a solid financial foundation to support our growth. Our success starts with our employees -- the ingenuity they bring to the marketplace and their execution of our strategy. For this reason, we are featuring in this report the insights, ideas and stories of employees from the Sempra Energy companies. More than ever before, our employees have embraced the challenge of delivering on our promises. To our employees, for their sustained commitment to excellence, and to you, our shareholders, for your ongoing support, I offer my heartfelt thanks.
