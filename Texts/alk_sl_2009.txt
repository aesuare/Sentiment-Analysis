To Our Shareholders
We recently had the privilege of ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, marking the beginning of a new trading day. The excitement and optimism was palpable. I am pleased to report that in 2009, Alaska Air Group rang some bells of its own, fueling optimism and confidence about our company's future at a time when the airline industry continues to struggle. Here's a brief rundown of some of our accomplishments over the past year: S Alaska Air Group's 2009 financial results were among the best in the industry, marking our sixth consecutive year of profitability and extending our profitability to 31 of the last 37 years.

Alaska Air Group CEO Bill Ayer, Alaska Airlines President Brad Tilden and Horizon Air President and CEO Jeff Pinneo, along with several other company executives, rang the New York Stock Exchange opening bell, signaling the commencement of trading on Tuesday, November 10, 2009. The event marked a partnership with the exchange that spans more than 25 years.

Alaska was ranked highest in customer satisfaction among traditional network carriers in North America by J.D. Power and Associates for the second year in a row. This recognition, along with the results of internal customer surveys, is testament to the warm, engaging experience provided by Alaska and Horizon employees.

Our Mileage Plan won the Freddie Award for "Program of the Year" for the fifth time in seven years. Alaska's Mileage Plan makes it possible for members to fly almost anywhere in the world through alliances with our many airline partners.

Alaska Airlines reported excellent on-time performance, finishing the year with nearly 83 percent of flights arriving on time. Alaska led the 10 largest domestic carriers in eight out of 12 months last year, which represents a marked improvement over a year ago. At just over 86 percent, Horizon's performance would have taken the top spot if they had participated in the official tally.

All in all, 2009 was an excellent year, considering the economic challenges. Lower oil prices provided welcome relief, while service to new cities and other changes to our network helped increase load factors. As a result, our bottom line reflected continued progress on margins and returns for our shareholders.

Strategic Plan
Not long ago, we took stock of the goals we set back in 2003, when we first embarked on what we dubbed our "2010 Plan." We were struck by a couple of things. One is that we've been very consistent with the direction we've taken the company over the past seven years. The other is that some targets that seemed like a real stretch back then have become a reality today, providing us with a powerful lesson in the importance of maintaining discipline around a few really important goals. Following is an update on our progress: S Safety ­ A safe operation is the foundation of our business. Alaska Air Group has been widely recognized for having state-of-the-art safety and compliance practices in all areas of our operation. People ­ Getting everyone aligned around the same goals is powerful. During 2009, we made significant progress toward having all employees at both airlines in a common gain-sharing plan that aligns our efforts around the four big drivers of our business: safety, customer satisfaction, costs and profitability. S Customers ­ At Alaska and Horizon, we are obsessed with providing our customers the best value for their dollar. We are pleased to offer an award-winning Mileage Plan, a firstclass cabin on Alaska Airlines, complimentary Pacific Northwest wines and micro-brews on Horizon Air, and a baggage delivery guarantee that is unique in the industry ­ all for prices that compare favorably with those of our competitors.

Alaska guarantees bags will be at the carousel within 25 minutes or customers receive $25 or 2,500 Mileage Plan miles.

Fleet ­ A single fleet type is a competitive advantage, allowing us to reduce pilot and maintenance expense. Alaska now has an all-Boeing 737 fleet, including 82 "Next Generation" aircraft, and Horizon has simplified its fleet to two types. Alaska's 737-700s, -800s and -900s, as well as Horizon's Q400s are the most fuel-efficient in their classes. Horizon will become an all-Bombardier Q400 operator when market conditions for our remaining CRJ aircraft improve. Route Network ­ Even as we decreased capacity on some routes in response to falling demand, we established a presence in new markets with the potential for future growth, adding 13 new city pairs at Alaska and Horizon during 2009. For example, Hawaii ­ which we began serving in 2007 ­ now makes up about 13 percent of Alaska's available seat miles.

Technology ­ Much has happened since Alaska pioneered selling tickets over the Internet and enabling customers to check in via the Web. We're continuing our tradition of technological innovation with the recent rollout of electronic boarding passes that can be displayed and scanned on a smart-phone. And, speaking of smart-phones, we have our own "app," making it more convenient for customers to check in and manage their trips from a mobile device. In addition, Alaska is working with the FAA to expand the use of next-generation flight guidance procedures that reduce flight times, air traffic congestion and fuel burn, thereby decreasing aircraft emissions and noise. Horizon is also expanding its use of state-of-the-art systems for greater navigational precision and operational reliability.

Financial Performance ­ We're still short of delivering a 10 percent return on invested capital, but the goal is firmly in view and we're making steady progress. We have maintained excess cash as a hedge against economic uncertainty, and we plan to put some of that to work over the next couple of years. Potential uses include repaying debt, paying cash for replacement aircraft, buying back shares and contributing to our defined benefit plans.

Although we haven't accomplished everything we mapped out in 2003, we've made good progress and learned some valuable lessons along the way. We have become much better at focusing our efforts on the most important goals and quickly making the changes needed to achieve them, while not getting distracted by things we can't control.

Current Initiatives
As in 2009, our 2010 key initiative is to increase revenue. We are taking a three-pronged approach that focuses on increasing non-ticket (or ancillary) revenues, improving the merchandising of our product and engaging front-line employees in the marketing process. We are redesigning the alaskaair.com Web site to more Average Revenue Per Passenger prominently feature hotel, car rental Horizon Air and vacation offerings, thereby Alaska Airlines $175 providing customers with convenient, 157 157 one-stop shopping.

Chart on right: In 2009, the economic downturn resulted in lower demand, placing downward pressure on average passenger revenue. The decline was largely offset by new revenue from the first bag fee that we initiated in July 2009.

In the 32 years since industry deregulation, one thing has become abundantly clear: customers want low fares. That means in order to offer travelers a great value and generate long-term returns for investors, we must have low costs. As we work to improve the top line, we are also targeting unit cost reductions at both airlines, with specific efforts aimed at improving productivity and reducing overhead costs.

We're optimistic about our future. Our long-term strategy is based on simple principles that don't change over time. And our decisions will continue to be guided by the overarching goals of providing a preferred product for customers, good careers for employees, and a healthy return for you, our shareholders. Because our company is smaller and more nimble, we reacted more quickly to the economic realities of the recent downturn. The changes we made, combined with the dedication, discipline and hard work of so many at Alaska and Horizon, have put us in position to benefit as the economy recovers and we prepare to "ring the bell" on a new day. Sincerely,

William S. Ayer Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Alaska Air Group April 1, 2010
