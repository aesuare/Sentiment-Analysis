 Letter to Shareholders
Doing The Right Things
  Jeff Turner, President and Chief Executive Officer
Spirit AeroSystems marked its five-year anniversary in 2010, and we believe the words we used to step out as an independent company are still true today. We’ve worked hard to build and maintain the right team, to establish ourselves in the right places, and to be prepared to meet the needs of both the moment and the future.
That’s not to say we haven’t been affected by the challenges of the world economy or been tested by short- term trials; we have. But we’ve stayed true to our mission to maintain our core business, win new work, and diversify where and how it makes business sense. As a result, we’ve grown from revenues of $3.2 billion in 2006 to almost $4. 2 billion in 2010. Our long-term relationships with key customers and our $28.3 billion backlog give us a firm foundation on which to build and grow.
Our efforts to keep our business healthy and our team
for the future intact are paying off. Products in our core business are ramping up in 2011. Many of our development programs are entering production. And we are ready.
A Skilled Team
A skilled core team is essential to our success. One of our goals during the tough economy has been to maintain a
“Today, we begin a new era in our rich heritage of aviation history...uniquely positioned to be the company of choice for commercial, general, regional,
and military aircraft, and aerospace manufacturers throughout the world... This is the right team. This is the right place. This is the right time.”
– Jeff Turner, June 17, 2005
stable labor force. We’ve been creative in avoiding layoffs when demand for our products has fallen, choosing shortened work weeks rather than furloughing employees. This plan helped us to be ready to resume production rates once demand returned.
Now, with announced rate increases on core business for Boeing and Airbus, we have the talent ready to take on the faster pace. In addition, with six development programs for several customers now in
 test stages and moving toward the initial phases of production, we remain focused on meeting our customer requirements.

In 2010, we reached
agreement on new long-
term labor contracts with
the IAM, UAW, and IBEW.
These unprecedented 10-
year contracts include new
pay-for-performance elements and represent a new, groundbreaking model of partnership and collaboration between the company and our represented employee

One of Spirit’s most readily recognizable products is the under-wing component package that includes the nacelle, thrust reverser, and pylon configuration. We build this package for every Boeing 737, 747, 767, and 777 commercial airplane. For the Boeing 787 we build the pylon, and on the Boeing 747-8 we build the pylon, inlet, and fan cowl. We hold the engineering and certification authority on all the commercial airplane under-wing components we build for Boeing aircraft.
Our expertise in the design, fabrication, and assembly of these complex, multi-contoured, lightweight, acoustically- treated components makes us a prime source of product development for future commercial, defense, and general aviation engine interface structural packages.
With the company’s entry into the regional and business jet markets, we are responsible for the design and build of pylons for the Mitsubishi Regional Jet and the Bombardier CSeries Jet, and the nacelle package for the Rolls-Royce BR725 engine which powers the Gulfstream G650 business jet.
Spirit’s Propulsion Systems Segment provides the thrust reversers sold and installed by our Aftermarket business. Service is provided around the world.
2010 accomplishments included:
n Delivered unit 3,500 of Boeing 737 Next Generation pylon and thrust reverser n Delivered unit 36 of B787 engine pylon

well. At divestiture in June 2005, we provided spares and services to many aircraft operators but through only one customer. By the end of 2005 we had six direct customers and five years later, in December 2010, we had over 500. Throughout 2010 we have grown our Aftermarket business:
n Distribution of spares to the Americas is managed at present
from sales offices in Wichita, Kansas,
 Over our first five years we’ve added
to our original operations in Wichita,
Kansas, and Tulsa and McAlester,
Oklahoma. Our first acquisition,
completed in April 2006, from BAE
Systems Aerostructures, established Spirit operations and office facilities in Prestwick, Scotland, and Samlesbury, England. Since then, we’ve continued to grow globally and now operate facilities on three continents as well as joint ventures and partnerships in Europe and Asia, including a newly certified MRO repair station in China.
In addition, we have MRO repair stations in the U.S. and Scotland, effectively providing airline customers worldwide with maintenance, repair, and overhaul services. We strategically position our operations to add efficiency to our processes while providing value to our customers.
Our 2010 milestones demonstrate this:
n In July we officially opened our new 585,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Kinston, North Carolina. Kinston employees design and build the composite center fuselage upper and lower shells and front wing spar for the Airbus A350 XWB aircraft using state-of- the-art technology and processes. The facility was built in proximity to a rail spur leading to a seaport location, where the fuselage sections will be shipped to France for assembly.
Spirit shipped the first leading edge outer spar component to Prestwick, Scotland, in December 2010, following two years of design work.

 Spirit’s work on the Boeing 787 program continues.
We build the 787’s composite forward fuselage, engine pylons, and wing leading edge components. In December, Boeing and Spirit reached an agreement covering the costs of configuration and engineering changes and program delays that will be finalized in 2011. Spirit will continue to work with Boeing to improve the 787 program and has dedicated supplier-customer design teams focused on reducing costs on the program.
The fuselage assembly, which includes composite cockpit and cabin sections designed and built by Spirit, was joined to a supplier-provided aft transition empennage section. Our contract with Sikorsky is to design, fabricate, procure, and build seven units of the cockpit/cabin sections of
the helicopter.
n Spirit’s P-8I team
has begun
production for the
Indian Navy’s first
long-range maritime
reconnaissance and
anti-submarine
warfare aircraft.
The P-8I, based on
the Boeing Next-
Generation 737
commercial airplane,
is a variant of the P-8A Poseidon that Boeing is developing for the U.S. Navy.
n Our work on Gulfstream programs continued in 2010, with support of the test phases for the G250 and G650, and of Rolls-Royce’s testing of the BR725 engine, which will power the G650.
Our core business is founded in solid long-term programs with Boeing and Airbus for large commercial aerostructures and components. Our customers’ confidence is manifested in new work and production rate increases. And it provides us a firm footing as we move programs out of development and into production.
Financial Performance
Spirit’s progress in several areas supported our financial performance for the year. We delivered over 950 core
