  Letter to Shareholders
alue. Our company was founded on the principle that consumers want value and marketers need to deliver that value in an efficient and effective way. Through our
RedPlumTM media portfolio, we believe we provide more value to consumers than anyone in the world – in the mailbox, newspaper, online and in-store. We deliver that world of value by reaching consumers how, when and where they want, and in return, provide advertisers with measurable results and exceptional return on investment (ROI).
   2010 Results and Highlights
2010 was a record year for our company. I am incredibly proud of what our team accomplished this year on top of an impressive 2009. In 2010, we increased our share price by 77% on top of an increase of 1200% in 2009; launched our unique In-Store business; gained momentum in our Digital business; and were listed as one of the “100 Fastest Growing Companies” by FORTUNE magazine, an international- ranking of public companies based on three years of performance.
Overall, results for 2010 were consistent with our long-term goal to drive annual mid-single-digit revenue growth and double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth. Revenue was up 4% and diluted EPS was up 39.7% excluding legal settlement proceeds and debt refinancing costs in 2010 from 2009a. We also continued our recession-based strategy to drive volume and increase market share across our product portfolio. For example, we distributed over 3 billion more pieces in our Shared Mail business in 2010 over 2009 – a high-single-digit percentage increase over 2009, driving our Shared Mail segment profit up more than 42% over 2009. Since our acquisition of the Shared Mail business in early 2007, we have significantly improved the management and profitability of the business. Strategically, it has also proven to be an effective solution for our clients given the secular declines in reach and frequency within the newspaper industry. We expect to see continued migration of newspaper content to our Shared Mail product in the future. The Shared Mail business has strong operating leverage where incremental revenue generates high margins.
We reduced total debt by $304.8 million during 2010, and we ended the year with a net debt of $460.3 million, a decrease of 47.8% from year-end 2009. In early 2011, we significantly improved our financial position and capital structure by refinancing our 81⁄4% senior notes due March 2015. This debt refinancing will save us approximately

$2.8 million in annualized interest expense by reducing the interest rate to 65/8%; extends the maturity to February 2021; and provides us with a less restrictive covenant package. We ended 2010 with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.4:1c and with $245.9 million in cash on the books. We will continue to look for ways to use our cash to drive shareholder value. As a possible example, we have a $192.7 million basket available for potential stock repurchase in 2011 under the terms of our current credit agreement.
We made significant volume and profitability gains in 2010, but much like the rest of the advertising industry, pricing continued to be under pressure due to the ongoing effects of the economic recession. Mid-year we started planning for an improving economic environment and pricing improvement when we saw the general lift in advertising industry rates. This included investing in sales training, and implementing the right incentive programs and organizational structure changes to launch
our three-year post-recession price improvement strategy. For these reasons, 2011 will be an important year for our company as we lay the foundation for driving ongoing sustainable, profitable growth for the future. Our three-year price improvement strategy positions us well to absorb anticipated inflationary cost increases in the future.
In 2010 we also celebrated the 25th anniversary of our partnership with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children® and the U.S. Postal Service® that changed the way our country searches for its missing children. Millions of consumers receive the “Have You Seen Me?®” ads found weekly in our RedPlum products. Valassis remains committed to bring many more children home. You could say this commitment to bringing hope to missing children and their families is part of our DNA at Valassis.
 
Momentum in In-Store and Digital
During the first half of 2010, we began developing and investing in a new In-Store advertising model that gives retailers better control of shopper experiences. Mid-year marked our launch into the In-Store industry, with over 2,000 stores in our network by year-end. We plan to grow our network by another 1,000 stores in 2011.
While digital media represents less than
1% of total consumer packaged goods coupon distribution, consumer interest continues to grow. We developed tremendous momentum in our Digital business in 2010. Our Digital portfolio includes e-mail,
secure print-at-home coupons, display ads, and coupon to card/ID, such as frequent shopper card or mobile phone. The greatest opportunities we see to monetize our digital efforts in the near future are with secure print-at-home coupons and coupon to card/ID. Secure coupon prints in our RedPlum Network grew over 300% in 2010 compared to 2009 and eclipsed historical baselines in January 2011. Coupon to card/ID download volume increased over 1000% in the second half
of 2010 over the first half of the year. In the near future, we expect coupon to card/ID to become increasingly important in the digital coupon arena, and we are a leader in building this digital channel.
In January 2011, we entered into a strategic relationship with AOL to create one of the largest digital coupon footprints in the United States which includes over 7,500 grocery stores. The agreement enables the sharing
of digital coupon offer content across
each other’s online and mobile networks. This joint effort provides advertisers with a vast distribution channel capable of reaching 127 million frequent shopper cardholders across the country on a weekly basis. More than 80% of shoppers participate in grocery and drug frequent shopper programs, and research indicates an overwhelming majority are interested in receiving savings from the Internet directly to their frequent shopper cards or unique ID.
Looking Forward
It is an exciting time at Valassis. While our mission to deliver value to consumers –
how, when and where they want – has not changed, the “how” we go about delivering this value continues to evolve. We continue to invest and develop our distribution channels to offer an even more robust blend of print and digital media. And more importantly, our market intelligence and unparalleled targeting capability provide valuable insights and better media solutions for our clients. Our Integrated Media Optimization (IMO) targeting tool rapidly calculates an enormous amount of data to design the most effective use of Shared Mail, newspapers and online media for advertisers. These insights and tools,
combined with our broad RedPlum portfolio, bring unprecedented value to our clients. Our products are performing better than ever before, providing the best ROI for clients in Valassis history. Getting fair value in return for the exceptional value we provide is an integral part of our plan for sustainable growth in profits and shareholder value in 2011, 2012 and beyond.
