A our

letter to shareholders

continuing expansion across product lines and into new territories

The combination of revenue growth in existing markets, expansion into new geographic areas, increased home sales to both move-up and emptynester buyers and our entry into the active-adult, age-qualified market all contributed to make fiscal 1999 our best year ever.
We produced our seventh consecutive year of record earnings, our eighth consecutive year of record revenues and backlog, and our ninth consecutive year of record contracts. In our fourth quarter, we achieved our 35th consecutive quarterly year-over-year record for sales contracts, and the highest revenues and earnings for any quarter in our Company's history. This year we earned a spot in the Fortune 1000 and ranked first among the Construction and Engineering Group for net profit margins.

Our results were stellar in all areas except one, the performance of our stock price. Although Wall Street apparently believes that most industries will continue to benefit from a healthy economic cycle, based on the stock prices in our industry, the Street seems to think that the home building cycle will end shortly and be followed by a severe and lengthy recession. We disagree. While fiscal 1999 was tremendous, fiscal 2000 has started out even better. Our sales are strong, the economy is healthy and the demographics that drive the luxury market are extremely positive. We began fiscal 2000 with a record 140 selling communities and a record backlog of nearly $1.07 billion, up 31% from the year before. This backlog equates to nearly three-quarters of 1999's record home building revenues. In addition, through the first six weeks of fiscal 2000, our deposits are running 34% ahead of 1999's record pace. Therefore, we believe that fiscal 2000 will be another record year. And, based on current projections, we believe fiscal 2001 will be a record year as well. We think that, sooner rather than later, the market will recognize these factors and give our stock a valuation that more accurately reflects our strong growth potential and our track record of 31% compound average annual earnings growth throughout the 1990s.

We are very excited about the future. As the only major builder focused primarily on the luxury market, we are well positioned to benefit from the tremendous demographics of the coming decade. The number of households earning $100,000 or more, in constant 1998 dollars, has grown at triple the rate of total U.S. households over the past 15 years and now totals 10.5 million households. The largest group of baby boomers, the four million born annually from 1954 to 1964, is entering its peak earning and move-up home buying years. The leading edge of the baby boom is moving into the emptynester market, and the active-adult market is gaining momentum, with the number of 55­64 year-old households projected to grow by 50% in the coming decade.

Diversification Across the Luxury Market Spectrum: By growing our two main product lines, move-up and empty-nester communities, and expanding into a third, active-adult, age-qualified communities, we'll reach three distinct groups of luxury buyers, each with tremendous growth potential. As we broaden the range of buyers we serve, we'll maximize the value of our brand name and benefit from greater economies of scale in marketing, purchasing and land acquisition efforts.

While the move-up market remains our largest niche, home sales to empty-nesters (50+ year-old buyers) now represent approximately 27% of total deliveries. In fiscal 1999, we entered our third niche, the activeadult market, as we opened our first two age-qualified communities totaling over 900 homesites.

Increasing Market Share in Current Territories: We have just started to ramp up in many of the the 36 markets where we build. Combined, these territories, which are located in 18 states in six U.S. regions, contain over 4.5 million households earning $100,000 or more. With this huge reservoir of potential luxury buyers, we view the 3,555 homes we delivered nationally in fiscal 1999 as just the beginning. In our most mature markets of suburban Philadelphia and Central New Jersey, we typically deliver 500 to 700 homes annually. Many of our newer markets have higher numbers of affluent households and more building permits. By growing our market share in these newer territories, we could triple in size. And as we extend our sales to emptynester and active-adult buyers, we could double again. Expanding Geographically into New Markets: This year, we built our first homes in San Francisco, San Diego, Chicago and Detroit, and we acquired Silverman Homes, a leader in the Metro Detroit market. And we have identified another dozen markets with very attractive demographics. Aligning our Financial Structure to Support our Growth Strategy: In fiscal 1999, we extended the average maturity of our long-term debt to beyond 2007 and increased our bank credit facility to $440 million. By reinvesting our earnings rather than paying dividends, we grew stockholders' equity by 17% to $616 million. These steps, coupled with our investment grade ratings from Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Duff & Phelps, give us a solid financial foundation for the future. Expanding our Brand by Maximizing Choice: Our brand name is associated with choice, quality, service and value. We enable our clients to create their dream homes by selecting from thousands of interior and exterior custom features. Our clients can make major structural additions such as guest suites, conservatories, four-car garages and elevators. By systematizing the process, we maintain big builder efficiencies, which translate into great value and quality for our buyers. Since our primary

competitors in the luxury market are smaller private builders, our financial and production strength gives us a great advantage. Embracing Technology in all Aspects of our Business: In fiscal 1999, we welcomed the one-millionth visitor to our award-winning web site. Our site now hosts over 4,000 visitors daily who spend, on average, nearly fifteen minutes per visit. The Internet has become a key point of first contact for our clients. It also has revolutionized the way we advertise and market our homes, recruit new employees and communicate with our investors. Technology drives our production process as well. We have computerized linkages at our architecture company and component manufacturing plants that enable us to manage the design and production of thousands of luxury homes each year. As the decade comes to a close, we are proud of what our team has accomplished. Since 1990, we have grown revenues from $200 million to $1.46 billion and earnings from under $10 million to over $100 million. Our operating and net profit margins have remained at the top of the industry and we have expanded from five to 18 states. Our goals for the coming decade are to continue producing outstanding growth in revenues and earnings; to keep expanding with a focus on profitability; and to continue delivering uncompromising quality and value to our homeowners and shareholders. We thank our shareholders for their patience and support, our home buyers for their confidence in us, and our associates for their outstanding accomplishments of this past year.
