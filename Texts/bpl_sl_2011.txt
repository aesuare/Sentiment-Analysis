Dear Valued Unitholders:

2011

On February 10, 2012, Clark C. Smith became Buckeye's Chief Executive Officer, succeeding Forrest E. Wylie who continues to serve Buckeye as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board.

was a year of milestones for Buckeye. We celebrated 125 years of continuous operations as a midstream energy company. What started as a Standard Oil crude oil pipeline from the western Pennsylvania oilfields to Cleveland, Ohio refineries in 1886 has grown into over 6,000 miles of pipeline and 64 million barrels of crude oil and liquid petroleum product storage spanning 22 states, Puerto Rico, and The Bahamas today. We also celebrated our 25th 500 year as a publicly traded master limited partnership listed on the 400 New York Stock Exchange. We successfully integrated the Bahamas 300 Oil Refining Company International, or BORCO, facility, the largest ac200 quisition in our long history, which expanded our footprint into the 100 international logistics market. We initiated and have already begun 0 delivering on the most ambitious growth capital expansion project in our history at the BORCO facility to further enhance the capabilities Adjusted EBITDA1 of our international assets. We also (In millions) expanded our domestic geographic footprint with the completion of the acquisition and successful integration of a significant portfolio of terminals and pipelines from BP North America, which represented the latest successful iteration of our terminal acquisition franchise.

Safety remains the highest priority at Buckeye and these excellent statistics demonstrate how our employees remain focused even as we integrate significant acquisitions and undertake substantial capital projects. Financial Summary Buckeye achieved record adjusted EBITDA for 2011 of $487.9 million compared to $382.6 million for 2010.1 Our Adjusted EBITDA, excluding transition expenses related to acquisition and integration activities, was $505.0 million, an increase of 31 percent over 2010 similarly adjusted. This increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of our BORCO facility and its contribution to our 2011 results. We also continued our uninterrupted history of quarterly cash distribution increases with the announcement of our 31st consecutive distribution increase for the quarter ended December 31, 2011. Distributions paid in 2011 totaled $4.025 per unit, representing a $0.20 per unit, or 5.2 percent, increase over 2010 cash distributions. We are proud of our history of payment of cash distributions in each quarter since becoming a publicly traded partnership in 1986.

Positioning for the Future Surviving and prospering for 125 years has required Buckeye to demonstrate the ability to anticipate global trends impacting our business and position our Partnership to capitalize on these trends. We believe a significant shift in refined product supply to the Northeast United States is underway as a result of the decline in east coast refining capacity, evidenced by the 2011 announcements regarding the anticipated shut down of over 50 percent of the refining capacity in the region.2 We believe that a significant portion of the idled refinery supply will be replaced by refined products imported from refining centers in Europe as well as the Middle and Far East. The global refined products logistics market will experience significant growth and increase in importance in supplying many of the markets we serve. We have developed and are executing a strategy to position Buckeye to participate in these global logistics markets. Our 2011 acquisition of the BORCO facility in The Bahamas was an important first step in positioning Buckeye for the future. BORCO is a

The Perth Amboy facility, along with our BORCO facility, is a key component of a long-term strategy to create a more fully integrated and flexible system that offers our customers unparalleled connectivity and service capabilities.
Our integration of this facility, as with all facilities we acquire, included implementing our best practices operating model to improve productivity and utilization at the lowest cost without compromising our commitment to safety and environmentally responsible operations. Our employees identified a number of potential productivity improvements, some of which have been implemented and others which we continue to analyze. We also initiated the largest internal growth capital investment plan in our long history that will result in 7.9 million barrels of storage capacity being added to this facility, with this additional capacity scheduled to be placed in-service over the next three to four years beginning in 2012. Buckeye is already benefiting from the completion of two significant projects in 2011: the refurbishment of one

of our offshore jetties, which increases our capacity to berth the largest petroleum carriers in the world, and the construction of an inland dock providing inclement weather berthing capabilities. Connecting the Dots We are very excited about our recent announcement of an agreement to acquire from Chevron a four million barrel terminal storage facility in the New York Harbor. This acquisition reflects Buckeye's efforts to enhance the competitive supply alternatives for our pipelines and terminals in the Northeast by ensuring direct access to waterborne imports of refined petroleum products. The facility, located in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, boasts three active docks including one ship dock with up to 37 feet of draft. Access to New York Harbor will allow the facility to serve as a key import terminal connecting

Buckeye's extensive inland pipeline system with imported products, which could include products imported through our BORCO marine terminal. Our integration plans include a direct pipeline link to our Linden complex, which is a key origination point for our Northeast pipeline system, as well as other significant growth capital projects at the facility that are anticipated to yield substantial incremental contributions to our financial results. The Perth Amboy facility, along with our BORCO facility, is a key component of a long-term strategy to create a more fully integrated and flexible system that offers our customers unparalleled connectivity and service capabilities. Execution on this strategy will continue to differentiate our service offerings and provide sustainability and optionality for future growth in our core business.

The Natural Gas Storage segment services natural gas demand in the San Francisco and Sacramento, California areas through its connection to Pacific Gas and Electric's intrastate gas pipeline system.

Terminal Growth Franchise

A significant cornerstone of our growth strategy in recent years has been the acquisition of assets sold by the major integrated petroleum companies. We refer to our ability to quickly integrate these spun-off assets while unlocking significant value through the application of our best practice formula as our terminal franchise. The 2011 acquisition of 33 terminals and over 600 miles of pipeline from BP North America was the latest opportunity for us to execute our terminal franchise. The acquisition facilitated our participation in several growth markets previously outside of our system footprint and allowed us to realize operating synergies with some of our existing assets. We have successfully implemented several commercial development initiatives to increase the value of these assets to our unitholders.

Operations Review The following is a summary of our operating highlights for 20113: Pipelines & Terminals  Adjusted EBITDA from our Pipelines & Terminals segment was $361.0 million in 2011 compared to $346.4 million the previous year. Pipeline volumes increased by approximately three percent primarily as a result of volumes moved on acquired pipelines. Strength in distillate volumes on our legacy pipelines were offset by some weakness in gasoline and heating oil movements. Terminalling volumes increased by 32 percent, benefiting from the BP terminals acquired in June 2011. Results for the year also benefited from higher pipeline tariff rates and terminalling contract rate escalations.

 We are executing a number of

internal growth projects expected to be completed during 2012, including expanded pipeline capacity from New York Harbor into Pennsylvania and Upstate New York markets.

International Operations  Our International Operations segment, which includes results of our BORCO and Yabucoa marine terminals, produced $113.0 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2011. We acquired 80 percent of BORCO on January 18, 2011 and the remaining 20 percent on February 16, 2011. Approximately 83 percent of 2011 revenue at our BORCO facility was derived from take-or-pay storage contracts with the remainder consisting of variable berthing and other ancillary revenues.

We look forward to being able to report on the achievement of important milestones in our growth strategy during 2012, Buckeye's 126th year of operations.

Natural Gas Storage  Adjusted EBITDA from our Natural Gas Storage segment was $4.2 million for 2011 compared to $29.8 million in 2010. Results of this segment were negatively impacted by low natural gas prices, compressed seasonal spreads, and lack of price volatility. Energy Services  Our Energy Services segment produced $1.8 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the year compared to $5.9 million in the prior year. 2011 results were impacted

Our top priorities for 2012 include the successful completion and integration of our Perth Amboy acquisition, which we expect to close late in the second quarter of the year. In addition, we are focused on the safe and successful execution of our strategic growth capital projects at our BORCO facility and those planned for the Perth Amboy facility after the acquisition closes. We will continue to pursue growth
