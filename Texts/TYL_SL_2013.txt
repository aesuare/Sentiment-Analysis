    shareholders
Net income was $39.1 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, an increase of 18.5 percent compared to $33 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, in 2012. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $52.3 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, up 22.9 percent from 2012. We achieved these solid results even as we expensed significant investments in long-term opportunities, including approximately $3.3 million in startup costs related to our statewide e-filing contract for Texas courts, as well as costs associated with onboarding staff to increase our capacity to deliver current and projected backlog.
Investing for Strength
From an economic perspective, the public sector experienced considerable challenges in recent years
that lengthened sales cycles and caused many local governments and schools to delay software purchases in 2010 and 2011. While many of our competitors reacted
to the slowdown by cutting back on research and development, Tyler chose to increase our investments in product development to further advance our already strong competitive position.
With many local governments seeing an improved economic environment over the last several quarters, activity in our market has gradually returned to normal levels, and Tyler has emerged from the recession stronger than ever. Win
    Tyler Technologies takes a steady, long-term approach to our business — building on successes and consistently investing in growth opportunities. In 2013, our commitment to that strategy continued to strengthen our position by magnifying the benefits of an improving market.
Not only did Tyler achieve our best year ever by virtually every financial measure, reaching new highs in revenues, earnings, bookings and backlog, but we did so while investing in emerging opportunities and continuing to improve our competitive position across our product groups. These results reflect our unwavering focus on the core strategy that has served our stakeholders so well over the years.
Financial Highlights
For the second consecutive year, Tyler achieved double- digit growth in revenue — bringing our 2013 total to $416.6 million, up 14.7 percent over 2012. Recurring revenue from maintenance and subscriptions accounted for 61 percent of total revenue, driven in part by growing client demand for cloud-based software as a service (SaaS) solutions. Subscription revenues rose 39 percent from 2012 as more new and existing clients opted for SaaS delivery, coupled with strong growth in revenue streams such as e-filing for courts.
Bookings grew even faster than revenues, with a 45 percent increase over 2012, pushing year-end backlog
up 45 percent to $551.7 million and enhancing visibility into 2014 and beyond. A great deal of the momentum
in bookings and awards in 2013 can be attributed to a growing number of multiyear SaaS agreements, along with a restructured e-filing contract with the state of Texas that replaces transaction-based fees with fixed revenues now included in backlog.
                               Tyler’s resolute business strategy, combined with a resurgence of public sector activity amid a strengthening economy, generated double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year.

     rates are up and we are clearly gaining market share. We spent a record $23.3 million on research and development in 2013 to keep the momentum going. And our client retention rate of approximately 98 percent serves as a powerful testament to our ability to deliver lasting value to the public sector clients we serve.
An Employer of Choice
Tyler’s current workforce already reflects an unrivaled level of experience supporting the public sector. In fact, more than 60 percent of employees who were with the company a decade ago are still with Tyler today. As Tyler continues to grow, attracting and retaining talented employees remains a top priority. That’s why we offer competitive compensation and benefits, career development opportunities, and a work environment that fosters employee pride. In August 2013, we moved into our new company-owned corporate headquarters in Plano, Texas, which allowed us to
consolidate our Courts & Justice Division and corporate staff from two separate leased spaces in the greater Dallas area. More than 400 employees office here, and the 26- acre campus offers considerable room for future expansion.
We were recognized for the sixth time as one of the Best Places to Work in Maine, where more than 500 Tyler employees are based, and we were ranked among North Texas’ Top 100 Places to Work by the Dallas Morning News. We were also recognized by the Dayton Daily News as one of the Top Workplaces in the Dayton metro area, where our Appraisal & Tax Division is headquartered. These accolades are important to us, in that they reflect our commitment to supporting the professional success and personal well- being of our employees. By strengthening our position as an employer of choice, Tyler continues to lead the industry with innovative, reliable solutions that are helping the public sector do more with less.

Through all economic climates, Tyler’s core growth strategies endure — expanding our geographic reach, broadening our product and service offerings, winning large-scale contracts, and extending our relationships with existing clients. As we review our 2013 performance and set our sights on the journey ahead, we extend our thanks to the valued shareholders, employees and clients who share our success as the journey continues.
