In an era of constant, rapid and unpredictable change, the concept of staying the course, especially in business, can seem like an impossible mission. It takes strong and confident leadership, a clear and focused strategy and a team of talented people who are willing to go the distance in order to achieve the goal.
Since fiscal 2010, the goal at Constellation Brands has been a singular one: profitable organic growth. During this period, we have embarked on an evolutionary journey that has taken us from a collection of stellar brands and acquired businesses to a highly disciplined and tightly aligned company that is, at every occasion, capitalizing on company-wide efficiencies and best practices to strengthen our operations, our people and our brands.
Our fiscal 2011 results serve as a shining indicator that our collective efforts are paying off. More importantly, they validate the importance of staying true to one’s commitments. At Constellation Brands, our commitments are unwavering...to continue to grow our business and our premium brands, to enrich the communities where we live and work and to elevate life with every glass raised.
These commitments are being realized every day because of our people, who are among the best and brightest in the industry. Dedicated, innovative and determined, our employees have stayed the course through unexpected challenges and increasingly higher expectations placed on them. We are grateful for their talents and tenacity and are proud to showcase the impressive results of their work throughout this Annual Report.
Sincerely,
RichaRd SandS
Chairman of the Board
