energizing...
 Dear Shareholder,
2011 was the best year in Peabody Energy’s 129-year history... a year with the safest performance, largest acquisition and strongest financial results on record... a year when Peabody, once again, energized the industry and the world.
The year was marked by multiple milestones.
Peabody set new marks in safety, revenues, operating profit, Adjusted EBITDA, net income, earnings per share and operating cash flows in the face of significant geologic and weather- related challenges.
Your company also completed a series of strategic actions that set the stage for long-term growth. This included the purchase of Macarthur Coal Limited, the world’s leading seaborne supplier of low-volatile pulverized coal injection (PCI) product.
Leading accomplishments in 2011 included:
• Improving our safety incidence rate nearly
30 percent compared to the prior year, with record safety performance in the United States and Australia;
• Delivering record revenues of $8 billion, an
18 percent improvement, led by higher pricing realizations across the company’s global platform and increased U.S. volumes;
• Increasing Adjusted EBITDA 16 percent to $2.13 billion, the highest in Peabody’s history;
• Generating operating profit of $1.59 billion, our best performance to date, leading to record operating cash flows of $1.63 billion;
• Expanding margins as well as increasing contributions from all operating segments;
• Advancing Australian metallurgical and thermal coal export expansions to serve high-growth Asian markets;
• Progressing multiple joint venture initiatives in Australia, China, Mongolia and Indonesia; and
• Earning recognition for safety, environmental and social responsibility, achieving more than 30 major honors around the world.

Peabody delivered the safest year in its history, ending 2011 with a global incidence rate of 1.92. The company’s U.S. safety rate is less than half the U.S. industry average based on the latest available data. In Australia, the company’s safety results in 2011 were 27 percent better than the latest available average of New South Wales and Queensland operators.

We continue reshaping Peabody’s portfolio to target the highest-growth regions. Our recent acquisition in Australia expands Peabody’s global platform to serve major demand centers around the world, adds a valuable coal product to one of the strongest metallurgical and thermal coal portfolios in the business, and brings Peabody’s Australian reserves to 1.2 billion tons.
Peabody Energy’s Australian Operations Contribute Half of Earnings
Peabody now ranks among the top three coal reserve holders in the world’s largest coal exporting nation.
Enormous energy needs around the world point to the early stages of what we expect to be a long-lived supercycle for coal – a period of sustained market expansion to meet the requirements of an emerging global middle class.
Economies are converging, populations multiplying, and nations industrializing
and urbanizing at an unprecedented pace. The International Energy Agency expects energy demand to grow by 50 percent in the next
25 years.
Coal is the only resource with the large scale and low cost to satisfy enormous global needs. Global coal consumption reached 7.5 billion tonnes in 2011, led by the world’s strongest economic performers in Asia. Demand for coal is expected to rise 4.4 billion tonnes by 2035.
The combination of global population expansion and increasing per capita intensity proved especially potent in driving global steel demand.
Peabody continues to build its Australia export platform and advance rail and port
access. Peabody is the second-largest equity holder in the Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group (NCIG)
terminal and has access to sufficient rail and port capacity to meet its Australia growth plans through 2015.

Peabody’s earnings profile illustrates the power of
the company’s global platform. Australian activities comprised less than 1 percent of the company’s Adjusted EBITDA eight years ago. In 2011, Australian operations contributed half the earnings to a greatly expanded base. 1 Australian Adjusted EBITDA for 2003 includes Wilkie Creek, which was
held for sale as of Dec. 31, 2011. Australian Adjusted EBITDA for 2011 excludes Wilkie Creek.
   
  Steel production rose 7 percent in 2011 and
is projected to rise nearly 40 percent within
the next decade, requiring approximately
400 million tonnes of additional metallurgical coal.
Similarly, within the next five years, nations are projected to bring on line another
370 gigawatts of generating capacity, representing 1.2 billion tonnes of added thermal coal use. Asia will continue to drive demand, and supply growth largely will come from Australia.
In the United States, a muted economy, mild weather and natural gas oversupply suppress the near-term outlook.
Peabody Energy’s Margins Superior to Average of NYSE-Listed Peers
Regulatory uncertainty also is contributing to increased retirements of older coal generating units.
We believe older, more costly Eastern generating plants will be disproportionately affected, while the lowest-cost, fastest-growing mining regions – the Southern Powder River and Illinois basins – are expected to grow the most rapidly in coming years. Longer term, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects growth in coal-fueled generation through 2035, with coal as the largest source of electricity generation.
Your company enters 2012 in a position of strength. In Australia, we are continuing to expand on our production base and targeting 45 million to 50 million tons of annual production by 2015, up from 2011 shipments of 25 million tons. Peabody’s expansions are accompanied by increased access to rail and port infrastructure.
Growing coal volumes are vital to energy consumers in Asia, where Peabody is advancing a number of joint venture opportunities. The company is focused on the growing Xinjiang province. Peabody also is advancing projects elsewhere in China, the world’s leading energy and coal user.
New offices in Germany, Indonesia and
India extend our business development
and trading and brokerage capabilities. Together, these actions are helping expand Peabody’s Asia-Pacific sales and production base, which could reach 100 million tons within the decade.
In the United States, we have a fully committed position for 2012. Peabody continues to benefit from our status as the leading producer and reserve holder in the low-cost Illinois and Southern Powder River Basins.

We also have little exposure to the majority of geology, permitting and compliance issues that prevail in high-cost Eastern U.S. mining regions, and we continue expansion and extension projects backed by baseload contracts.
Looking ahead, Peabody has four core focus areas in 2012:
• Maintaining operational excellence in areas of safety, productivity, process improvement and cost control;
• Capturing value by integrating Peabody’s Australian platform following our major acquisition;
• Successfully advancing our organic growth projects, including several U.S. mine developments and the expansions of multiple Australian metallurgical and thermal export mines; and
• Deleveraging following a major acquisition. While debt levels are manageable,
the company will continue to emphasize commercial and operating plans that generate cash, enhance margins and reduce debt.
At the same time, Peabody will invest capital selectively in high-return projects and joint ventures, while managing the company’s overall portfolio through opportunistic actions such as the planned sale of the Wilkie Creek Mine in Australia.
Peabody is proud to deliver the strongest safety and financial results our company has achieved in 129 years of operation. We have the No. 1 position in the fastest-growing, lowest-cost U.S. regions... we have an expanding global metallurgical and thermal export platform... we have a major growth pipeline... and we have access to the very best markets around the world.
Peabody’s position is unmatched, and our priorities for 2012 are clear. The outlook is very bright indeed for the world’s largest private- sector coal company, both in the near term and over the long haul.

Electricity Generation (TWh)
By 2020, incremental coal use for generation is projected to surpass that of gas, oil, hydro, nuclear, geothermal, biomass and solar combined. Asian nations are expected to comprise 83 percent of this growth. About 90 gigawatts of advanced coal-fueled generating units are scheduled to come on line in 2012, representing nearly 300 million tonnes of additional coal use per year.
