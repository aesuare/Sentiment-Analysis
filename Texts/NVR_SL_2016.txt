In 2016, NVR sold 15,583 homes and earned $103.61 per diluted share, increases of 11% and 15%, respectively, over 2015 results. Both of these metrics are records for the company. Other highlights of our 2016 results include: · Homebuilding revenues of $5.7 billion (up 13% vs. 2015) · Net income of $425.3 million (up 11% vs. 2015) · Year-end backlog of 6,884 units, with a dollar value of $2.7 billion (up 14% vs. 2015) We achieved these results against a backdrop of a housing market that continues to slowly improve. Housing starts, permits and new home sales all posted increases in 2016. Affordability is still at high levels, even considering the recent movement in mortgage rates. In addition, the unemployment rate and median incomes have both continued to improve. However, the recovery continues to be slower than most people expected and housing activity is still well below historical averages. NVR's strong financial performance is due in large part to our disciplined adherence to our business model, which is focused on maximizing liquidity and minimizing risk. Unlike our major competitors, our sole business is selling and building quality homes, without the risk of owning and developing land in a cyclical industry. The liquidity generated by this business model has been employed by NVR to grow our business while continuing our history of returning excess capital to our shareholders through our share repurchase program. 2016 was the fourth consecutive year of purchasing at least $400 million of NVR stock, which has resulted in a 25% decrease in outstanding shares since December 31, 2012. In addition to our focus on liquidity, another key aspect of our business model is emphasizing local market concentration. We strive to be the dominant builder in each of our markets. The local market scale achieved from this strategy allows us to leverage our employees, management staff, local market knowledge and relationships with business partners. As a result, we are able to maintain lower costs and achieve higher returns on capital. Regardless of business model, achieving the type of performance we have isn't possible without a constant focus on our customers. We take great pride in our reputation as a company that places the customer first. In fact, over 95% of our customers are so pleased with NVR that they would recommend us to family and friends. Customer service ratings at these levels are a reflection of the quality of our employees, our products and our service. Treating our customers this way is important to us and the only way we choose to do business.
