Chairman’s Letter
To MetLife’s Shareholders:
In 1998, MetLife announced that it would create a new financial services holding company and raise capital through an initial public offering of common stock. Through this IPO, we fueled the company’s growth and created an enterprise that, today, addresses shifting demographics in the United States and abroad through MetLife’s best-in-class products and services. The tasks and requirements associated with such a successful transformation were certainly very challenging but, now more than five years after becoming a public company, the results of our efforts are evident: since 2000, total assets have increased 90%; premiums, fees and other revenues are up 55%; life insurance in-force is up 65%; and MetLife’s market capitalization is now more than three times what it was in April 2000.
In 2005 alone, MetLife’s achievements and growth were equally impressive. Not only did we announce, close and integrate our acquisition of Travelers Life & Annuity, substantially all of Citigroup Inc.’s international insurance businesses and CitiStreet Associates (collectively, Travelers) in ten months, we once again generated record financial results. It is with great pride that, in my last letter to you as chairman of the board, I can report to you, our shareholders, that 2005 marked MetLife’s fourth consecutive year of record net income growth. In 2005, MetLife earned $6.16 per diluted common share in net income available to common shareholders, a 69% increase over 2004’s results. Amid modest equity market performance and rising interest rates, MetLife’s premiums, fees and other revenues reached $30 billion, a 14% increase over 2004. In addition, total assets grew 35%, in large part due to the Travelers acquisition, to reach $482 billion.
Meeting our business objectives and closing and integrating the Travelers acquisition were aggressive, but equally crucial goals. However, the results of our efforts are clear: record financial results, a seamless integration of the Travelers businesses and—perhaps most important—the demonstration that MetLife is a company that delivers on its promises.
H Record Business Performance
During the year, our diversified businesses performed extremely well, both financially and operationally, as they achieved record net income and contributed to MetLife’s growth and expansion.
Institutional Business continued to demonstrate and reinforce its market leadership as it grew net income by 23% over 2004’s results. MetLife remains a leader in the group product area and, according to LIMRA and MetLife Market Research, continues to hold the number one ranking in sales of group life, auto and home, long-term care and disability products, as well as institutional annuities and structured settlements.
While generating record sales growth in multiple product lines, Institutional also introduced a new long-term care product and improved efficiencies by holding expenses at 2004 levels. All of this was accomplished while integrating the Travelers retirement business, which increased MetLife’s retirement and savings general account assets by 62%. Institutional also continues to focus on both growing and maintaining its market share. It has reorganized its product groups to better align with customers’ needs and placed a renewed emphasis on service, which both our customers and distributors identify as an important differentiator in our business.
On the retail side, Individual Business (IB) net income increased 70% as the segment grew life sales faster than the industry, retained agents at record levels and improved distribution profitability by more than 20%.
During the year, IB’s distribution network continued to diversify and grow, particularly in independent distribution channels. While managing Travelers integration work, IB reorganized its independent distribution channels to better serve client needs; redesigned the life and annuity product portfolio; restructured the operations platform for the independent channel and realigned its affiliated distribution network and offered new products. These new product offerings included new living benefits for MetLife’s variable annuities, including the Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit rider and an enhancement to the Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit rider, as well as a new suite of universal life insurance products. In addition to ensuring that MetLife is taking advantage of shifting demographics and growing multicultural markets, IB continues to further its retail growth strategy of focusing on the needs of both clients and distributors in order to drive profitability.
Auto & Home net income was up 8% in 2005 over the prior year. Despite the impact of some of the most destructive hurricanes in history and other catastrophes, new business sales grew 16% over 2004, customer retention grew and the non-catastrophe combined ratio improved from 90.4% in 2004 to 86.7% in 2005. During 2005, Auto & Home launched a new product, GrandProtect, a comprehen- sive ‘‘package’’ policy that provides personal insurance protection for consumers with complex insurance needs. In addition, MetLife Auto & Home was ranked one of the top companies for delivering customer satisfaction to homeowners in J.D. Power and Associates’ annual 2005 National Homeowners Insurance Satisfaction Study.
Adding to our growth in the marketplace was MetLife Bank, which grew deposits by 61% to reach $4.3 billion at the end of 2005. In addition, MetLife Bank introduced residential mortgages as it took steps towards becoming an increasingly important contributor to MetLife’s overall success.
In International, net income increased 18% over the prior year, driven in large part by the acquisition of Travelers’ international businesses. This acquisition significantly increased MetLife’s presence in markets outside of the United States and gave us access to new countries, including Australia, Belgium, Japan, Poland and the United Kingdom. Today, MetLife has access to 71% of the world’s life insurance markets, up from 36% in 2004. At the same time, the transaction increased MetLife’s number of customers outside of the U.S. from 9 million to 15 million and also added new distribution capabilities. In addition to the U.S., MetLife now holds leading market
  
positions in Japan, Mexico and South Korea. As MetLife seeks opportunities for growth in the future, we will continue to tap a shifting and diverse marketplace beyond the borders of the U.S., in countries where we see the potential to grow and expand.
MetLife demonstrated again in 2005 that it has the ability to create shareholder value. During the year, book value increased 19% over 2004 to $35.83 per diluted common share. MetLife also increased its common stock dividend 13% over 2004 to $0.52 per common share.
H Moving Ahead
In 2005, MetLife celebrated its fifth anniversary as a public company and its 137th year of providing financial solutions for generations of individuals and their families. It was also a very special year for me, as it marked my last full year as the head of this outstanding organization. And while 2006 will be another evolutionary year for MetLife, filled with new beginnings, one thing that will remain a constant is MetLife’s commitment to offering the best products and services that our customers can rely on for their lifetimes. This company is extremely well positioned to continue to achieve great things and I can’t think of anyone more experienced than Rob Henrikson to take MetLife to the next level among the giant league of financial services companies.
I wish all of you and all of my colleagues at MetLife the very best. Sincerely,
Robert H. Benmosche Chairman of the Board MetLife, Inc.
