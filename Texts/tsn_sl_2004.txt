  TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
  John Tyson Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Tyson Foods is more than the world’s largest protein company. We are a company that powers people’s lives. Through our products, our services and the Tyson brand, we give people the strength and energy to help them live their lives and achieve their dreams. This is because our products are protein-packed, and the sustainable energy from protein powers people longer than sugar and carbohydrates. Tyson = Protein = Power. In August, we launched a new $75 million “Powering” marketing and communications strategy designed to market our full range of chicken, beef and pork products under the Tyson brand and the new slogan, “Powered by Tyson.” At Tyson, we are united to “Power” people everywhere. We’re embarking on a new era in our company, one that will be marked by opportunity and potential success for our team members, customers, consumers and shareholders.
In July 2004, we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the birth of my grandfather, John Tyson, the founder of what is now Tyson Foods, Inc. In 2005, we will celebrate our
70th anniversary as a company. If my grandfather were alive today, he would be pleased to see what Tyson Foods has become under the current management team and those who came before us. I think he would be especially proud of what we accomplished this year.
Tyson Foods ranked 44th in Fortune magazine’s list of the 100 fastest growing companies. Fortune cited our 49 percent revenue growth, 41 percent earnings per share growth and 32 percent total market return during a three-year period. This simply is the result of a lot of hard work by many talented people. We have built the foundation and created opportunities for growth now and in the future.
I am satisfied with the results we posted in 2004. Our financial performance reflects our position as the world’s leading processor and marketer of chicken,
beef and pork. We have the size, scale and balance of proteins to succeed during difficult times in the industry.

Reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $1.13 compared to $0.96 last year, an 18 percent increase. Our long-term goal is to achieve average double-digit EPS growth. Sales were $26.4 billion in 2004 compared to $24.5 billion in 2003. Strong cash flow allowed
us to pay down debt by $242 million this year and
$1.5 billion since August 2001. One of the goals we set for fiscal 2004 was to achieve a debt-to-capital ratio of 45 percent in 12 to 18 months. Not only did we achieve our goal within 12 months, we exceeded it by reaching 44 percent at year’s end. Our new debt-to-capital goal for 2005 is 40 percent.
Our return on invested capital (ROIC) was 12.2 percent, up from 11.0 percent last year.* Our ROIC goal for 2005 is 14 percent. Our stock price finished the year 18 percent higher than 2003 and outperformed the S&P 500 over the three-year period from fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2004.
* Adjusted ROIC increased from 9.9 percent in 2003 to 14.1 percent in 2004. Fiscal 2003 adjustments included costs related to plant closings, amounts received in connection with vitamin antitrust litigation and impairment of an equity interest in a live swine operation. Fiscal 2004 ROIC adjustments included costs related to plant closings, BSE-related charges, fixed asset write-downs and impairment of various intangible assets.
We set a goal to increase the percentage of sales of value-added products to 50 percent over the next five years. We finished 2004 at 38 percent value-added, and our goal for 2005 is 40 percent. Our company developed 400 new products this fiscal year to meet the changing needs of customers and consumers. However, adding value means more to us than creating new, higher margin products. Value also is providing a set of services to our customers and consumers. Service is what separates us from our competition.
We are creating value and growth by filling in the gaps
in our current product offerings, by creating new and innovative products to expand existing categories and by creating new categories. We are focused on penetrating markets for these products as well as the hundreds of products we introduced in 2003.
We are the leading product innovator in our industry. I believe emphasizing innovation will bring great new products to the consumer, increase value for our

customers, improve margins and increase value for our shareholders. To support our efforts, we announced a new 184,000 square foot Discovery Center here
in Springdale.
When the Discovery Center is operational in late 2005, it will house expanded product development kitchens and provide space for our consumer insights group and team member development activities. An important part of this new facility is a state-of-the-art USDA-inspected pilot plant capable of developing and testing chicken, beef, pork and prepared food products and processes. This
will enable us to shorten the time from product concept to introduction. The Discovery Center underscores our continued commitment to innovation and forward thinking. As a leader in the food industry, we believe
the discovery of new products, processes and consumer insights and helping our people discover their unique gifts and talents is crucial for the continued success of our company.
Also, key to our success is cost management. To maintain our position as the best-cost producer in the meat and poultry processing industry, we are focused on improv- ing our manufacturing efficiencies, capabilities and capacity through automation and “steel to the floor” capital improvement projects. Our initiatives in this area include increased operating efficiencies, plant automa- tion and rationalization. Primarily through attrition,
we accomplished our goal of reducing our plant staffing by 5 percent or 6,000 people, and we did not send
jobs overseas.
We are controlling costs by increasing efficiencies through automation and yield improvement. We approved approximately $200 million in capital spending in 2004 for cost savings and income producing projects. Out of these expenditures, we identified more than
$63 million in annual savings. All of this has been accom- plished while maintaining our focus on quality, food safety, people safety and service to our customers.

Our company is stronger today because of our asset rationalization. While maintaining capacity, we closed and consolidated seven operations in the past two years. In the future, we will continue to evaluate more oppor- tunities for improving efficient use of our assets.
An on-going goal we have at Tyson Foods is to develop our people. We made strides this year in identifying
and preparing team members to become our future leaders through our Emerging Leaders development and mentoring program. As I see team members learning and growing in their careers, I am confident Tyson Foods will be in capable hands for years to come.
Another extremely capable person is now part of Tyson Foods. Albert Zapanta has been elected to the Board
of Directors. He is our first Hispanic board member, and his appointment brings the total number on the Tyson Foods board to 10, with five members being considered “independent.” Leland Tollett was named lead director.
Sadly, we lost a valued member of our board and a pioneer in our industry when Bob Peterson passed away in May. His wisdom and experience were crucial in forming the new company, and he will be missed.
I am proud of the hard work our team members do every day to make Tyson Foods a great food company and to create long-term value for you, our shareholders. We will continue building on our success and our position as the world’s leading protein company. This has been a good year for us, and we’re looking forward to another good year in 2005.
