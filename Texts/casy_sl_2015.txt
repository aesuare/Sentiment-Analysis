Message to Shareholders
                   Fiscal 2015 proved to be another successful year for Casey’s General Stores, Inc. Our same-store sales continued on an industry-leading pace and, along with strong fuel margins, enabled the Company to achieve record earnings. As a result, the market has rewarded those efforts with a 20% increase in our stock price throughout the fiscal year, and a 113% increase over the last five fiscal years. During this same five year period, our dividend has increased 58% providing a 125% total return to our shareholders. It truly is an exciting time for the Company, as well as our shareholders.
However, there is still work to
be done. We continue to deploy multiple store-level initiatives in an attempt to realize even more from our existing store base, while at the same time growing our business through a combination of new store construction and acquisitions. Since the inception of each initiative, the Company has converted approximately
700 stores to 24-hours, has completed 257 major remodels, and has over 330 stores offering pizza delivery service. In addition, the Company completed 45 new store constructions and 36 store acquisitions in fiscal 2015. In the near-term, we plan to accelerate the deployment of these operational initiatives. We also believe there are ample opportunities to build and acquire more stores.
The successful growth has created the opportunity to significantly invest in our distribution and logistics capabilities. The Company recently finished a 40,000 square foot addition to the distribution center in Ankeny, Iowa. We also broke ground in January of 2015 on a second distribution center in Terre Haute, Indiana. The new facility is expected to be operational in February of 2016. These projects will enable us to more efficiently distribute goods to our stores, and at the same time provide greater access to new markets.
