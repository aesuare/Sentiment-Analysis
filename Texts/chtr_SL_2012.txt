This is an exciting time at Charter, with significant change and an opportunity for faster growth. When I joined the company last year, I saw that we had a number of strengths: an upgraded and bidirectional cable network; an attractive market footprint; and many talented employees committed to serving our customers and growing our business. These strengths give us the opportunity to create shareholder value by increasing our market penetration, by adding new customers and by deepening our relationships with existing customers. In 2012, we made fundamental changes to our strategy and accelerated plans to achieve customer growth. The first and most visible change was developing new pricing and packaging across all of our products, simplifying the message and increasing value to our customers. Doing so has helped us better position our products and focus our selling efforts. As a cornerstone of that new offer, we made dramatic improvements to our video product, increasing the number of HD channels we offer to more than 100 and actively marketing digital products. Our goal is for Charter to be an all-digital provider by the end of 2014. Exiting the analog television business allows us to do

two important things: put our best product in front of more customers, and reclaim valuable bandwidth to continue to expand our video and broadband offerings. Our new pricing and packaging also made Charter's digital phone service even more attractive, enabling us to now offer what we believe is the most competitive triple play package--video, Internet and

Finally, we have reorganized our operations and business processes to improve service quality everywhere we operate. That includes network maintenance and capital spending practices, roles and responsibilities across the organization and ensuring that our technicians and customer service representatives have the training and tools to do their jobs at the highest quality standards. These initiatives put us in a better position to improve our services and increase our market penetration. We now offer highly competitive video, phone and Internet services that are combination of advantages creates significant opportunity for Charter. It's still early in our efforts, but our 2012 results are encouraging. We grew revenue 3.9% last year and added nearly 110,000 new residential customer relationships. Moreover, our revenue growth was accelerating at the end of the year. As we ended 2012, approximately 30% of our customer base was under our new pricing and packaging. These customers have richer products, are less likely to require service calls, and are less likely to churn. In addition to our progress in the residential market, we also have a tremendous opportunity in commercial services, providing advanced broadband and telecommunications services to the business market. That opportunity is just beginning to be developed in Charter's footprint, and in 2012, we saw another year of 20% revenue growth in this part of our business. Our adjusted EBITDA was $2.694 billion in 2012, and over time, the operational improvements and pricing strategies are designed to grow the bottom line with free cash flow to follow. Progress toward these goals will be measured by deeper product penetration, higher revenue per relationship, lower transaction costs per customer, and longer customer lifetimes. In 2013, we are focused on a few key areas of execution. The first is to maximize the full potential of our two-way, high-capacity, interactive cable plant. This means maintaining our superior Internet speeds and reliability, investing in plant improvements that sustain high

ing capability that enables customers to access content from smart devices. Operations and customer care improvements will also continue in 2013, particularly as the organizational and process changes we made in 2012 take hold. We are moving in the right direction on many fronts, and continue to improve the service we deliver to our customers. Finally, we are focused on driving commercial growth using the product, service, and network improvements that we have accelerated throughout our business. We have achieved a great deal in a short period of time. I want to extend my sincere thanks to Charter's nearly 18,000 employees for embracing the change with enthusiasm and energy. I also want to thank the more than five million Charter customers throughout the country and our supporters in the investment community. Our goal is to continue to improve, rewarding our customers, employees, and shareholders with the additional value we create. Best regards,
