Letter to Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholder: For General Dynamics, 2003 was a year of growth and accomplishment. Revenues grew 20 percent to $16.6 billion. Net income grew 9 percent to $1 billion, despite significantly reduced operating earnings at Gulfstream and sizeable charges incurred in connection with commercial shipbuilding. Cash generated by operating activities reached a record $1.7 billion. Our free cash flow from operations ­ cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures ­ was $1.5 billion, 150 percent of net income. Our strong cash flows enabled us to spend $3 billion on acquisitions, pay out $249 million in cash dividends and repurchase $300 million of General Dynamics' shares in the open market, while increasing net debt only $2.1 billion. Each of our major business groups passed significant milestones in 2003, some of which I would like to highlight here.
INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY

Nicholas D. Chabraja Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

The Information Systems and Technology group became the largest source of both revenue and operating earnings for your company. Revenue and earnings grew an impressive 35 percent and 23 percent, respectively. We purchased Veridian Corporation to increase our access to the growing intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) markets of the Department of Defense, the national intelligence agencies and the Department of Homeland Security. Two smaller acquisitions, Creative Technology Incorporated and Digital System Resources, further enhanced our role in this area. We also saw strong growth in our command-and-control, communications and computing (C4) businesses that serve U.S. and allied military customers. The growth in the tactical communications market in particular reflects the military's drive to integrate the Soldier, Sailor, Marine and Airman into a network-centric fighting force with real-time situational awareness and the resources to rapidly identify and respond to enemy threats. To better meet the needs of our customers, we consolidated our Decision Systems and C4 Systems businesses in late 2003. The resulting

business will be an even more effective competitor in the tactical command-and-control and communications markets in the United States, Canada, Taiwan and the United Kingdom, in support of General Dynamics United Kingdom.

We also benefited from strong network infrastructure demand in 2003, as government and commercial customers pursued technologically advanced and reliable voice, video and data capabilities. Network Systems' expertise in designing, installing, integrating and operating complex networks supports the ongoing effort, particularly in the Department of Defense, to improve connectivity throughout government operations. In addition, part of the Veridian acquisition further expanded our reach into the federal market for information technology support services.

COMBAT SYSTEMS

  

Our Combat Systems group's sales and operating earnings grew more than 40 percent in 2003, the result of both organic growth and acquisitions. This growth substantially enhances the group's position as one of the world's leading suppliers of combat vehicles and related systems.

During 2003, the group won over $2 billion in contracts related to the U.S. Army's Future Combat Systems and received a $384 million contract for the third of six planned Stryker brigades. The Army also awarded Combat Systems the contract to lead development of the Future Force Warrior, a suite of systems designed to increase the lethality and survivability of combat soldiers through advanced communications, weapons and protection technologies.

In March 2003, we purchased General Motors Defense. This acquisition consolidated the successful Stryker program and gave us significant armored combat vehicle business in Europe through MOWAG of Switzerland. In October, we further expanded our international presence by purchasing Steyr of Austria. We have combined MOWAG and Steyr with Santa Bárbara Sistemas, our Spanish combat systems business, to create European

Land Combat Systems. This business is well positioned to compete in Europe and other parts of the world for this expanding market. Combat Systems has emerged as a full-spectrum ground force provider, offering a range of armored vehicles ­ tracked, wheeled and robotic ­ and other products that span the warfighter's needs, including numerous types of ammunition and individual and crewserved weapons.

MARINE SYSTEMS

Fully Diluted EPS

This past year was a challenging one for the Marine Systems group. Losses associated with commercial shipbuilding at NASSCO reduced the group's operating earnings.

$6.00 5.04 4.36 4.00 4.48 4.65 4.52

On the bright side, the group had a year of extraordinary backlog growth, including an $8.4 billion award to Electric Boat for construction of six Virginia-class submarines. Marine Systems also received a nearly $1 billion contract for two additional Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and a $290 million award for the fourth T-AKE combat logistics ship. The 56 percent increase in the group's total backlog this year provides solid and predictable work well into the next decade.

As Gulfstream began 2003, a global recession had reduced demand in the business-jet market. The resultant loss of volume coupled with an oversupply of unsold new inventory put significant pressure on new aircraft prices. In addition, an oversupply of pre-owned aircraft sharply reduced the value of aircraft previously accepted as trade-ins. As a result, the Aerospace group's financial performance declined dramatically in the first quarter of 2003. In response to these conditions, we significantly reduced costs and adjusted our approach to the pre-owned market. Performance steadily improved and by the second half of 2003, Gulfstream was reporting steadily increasing profitability. Despite the challenges presented by worldwide economic problems, Gulfstream continued to enhance its market-leading product line. In August 2003, Gulfstream received FAA certification for the G550, the most technologically advanced and longest range business jet available. The G550 recently was awarded the prestigious Collier Trophy by the National Aeronautic Association for exceptional advances in both safety and performance, duplicating the achievement of its predecessor, the GV. In October 2003, Gulfstream introduced the G450, the latest aircraft in Gulfstream's best-selling large-cabin, long-range line. The G450 offers many of the same technological advances as the G550, including the PlaneView® cockpit and the Enhanced Vision System. Most recently, Gulfstream introduced the large-cabin, mid-range G350, with the largest cabin volume, most advanced avionics and best performance in its class.

General Dynamics 2003 Annual Report

For 2004, we see signs of an improved market for Gulfstream. This apparent improvement was evidenced by strong increases in the number of orders for both large and mid-size aircraft during the second half of 2003 and a clear stabilization of the pre-owned market for large-cabin aircraft.
LOOKING FORWARD

General Dynamics has entered 2004 solidly positioned for strong performance. At $41 billion, our backlog is at an all-time high. The Global War on Terrorism, Operation Iraqi Freedom and homeland defense concerns have focused the U.S. government's efforts on ensuring that our armed forces are equipped and trained to prevail in conflicts around the world. At the same time, the military is committed to transforming into a more lethal, agile and survivable force. As a result, the Department of Defense has received substantial budget increases since 2001, and likely will continue to receive support for its initiatives in the near term. Equally important, the general economy and the capital goods markets are improving, a good sign for the business-jet market. Your management team will continue to focus on earnings, cash flow and return on invested capital as we execute current backlog and capture additional business. As we convert net earnings into free cash, we will deploy that cash in a highly disciplined way to generate value for our shareholders.

Sincerely,

Nicholas D. Chabraja
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
