To Our Stockholders,
 We are pleased to announce our fourth consecutive year of record earnings. Despite a slight decline in sales, somewhat influenced by a second cool summer in a row, we achieved an 8.6% increase in diluted earnings per share, excluding special items, from $2.32 to $2.52. This profit improvement is primarily the result of the skill and efforts of our people.
We have designed and tooled products we previously purchased.
We have streamlined and improved efficiency in manufacturing and distribution through a formal program of continuous improvement.
We have achieved purchasing savings in many areas, assisted by our engineering and quality group in Hong Kong.
We have increased production in Mexico and Poland, which has enabled us to improve our competitive position in the marketplace. Further, we now have a joint venture with Gwo Yng, a leading manufacturer of Temperature Control products in Foshan, China, and we are now a basic manufacturer of these products in a low cost environment.
We have successfully integrated eight recent acquisitions. These are becoming increasingly important and profitable parts of our company.
Perhaps even more significant, our position in the marketplace, and our customers’ perception of us, continues to improve. In the past several months, we were awarded “Vendor of the Year” by three major customer groups. These are significant awards.

     We compete with hundreds of vendors, and are rated on sales increase, quality, shipping performance, training, catalog and coverage, marketing efforts— essentially every aspect of the business. To win three at once is quite a major achievement, and we acknowledge and thank all of our people for helping the company to win these awards.
Finally, we are pleased that our performance has enabled us to increase returns to our shareholders. In 2015 we increased our quarterly dividend from $0.13 per share to $0.15 per share, and announced the planned purchase of up to $10 million of our common stock. This is on top of the $10 million share repurchase completed in 2014.
In all, 2014 was a good year, but it is now history. All our efforts are focused on 2015 and beyond. We are
optimistic as we look ahead. The demographics of our industry remain positive—as the average age of vehicles continues to increase, and, with gasoline prices coming down, miles driven continues to rise. Most of all, however, we are optimistic because of our people.
