DEAR SHAREHOLDER:
For the past two years, we’ve been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling three key levers to drive value for shareholders: portfolio, performance and capital allocation. In 2015, we made significant progress in all three areas.
PORTFOLIO
In November 2015, we announced a transaction that represents the capstone on our portfolio journey — merging with Plum Creek Timber to create the world’s premier timber, land, and forest products company. The new Weyerhaeuser is the largest private timberland owner in the U.S., with:
• more than 13 million acres of the most productive and diverse timberlands in the country,
• unparalleled expertise in real estate, energy and natural resources, and
• industry-leading wood products manufacturing operations.
This merger is an outstanding strategic fit, and it will create superior long-term value for our shareholders. In the first full year, we expect the combined company will:
• capture more than $100 million in cost synergies,
• repurchase $2.5 billion of shares, and
• generate more cash flow per share for our shareholders than either company could alone.
In addition, we announced the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Cellulose Fibers business. Our goal is to position that business to achieve its full potential and at the same time allow Weyerhaeuser to focus on our priorities for growth and capital allocation.
PERFORMANCE
Our relentless focus on operational excellence is becoming ingrained in the way we work, and we’ve made great progress toward the targets we set two years ago. In 2015, we achieved:
• $39 million of OpX improvements in Timberlands,
• $88 million of OpX improvements in Wood Products, and • $47 million of OpX improvements in Cellulose Fibers.
Although there is more work to do, I’m encouraged by the innovation, collaboration, and plain hard work that are yielding clear improvements in our relative performance.
CAPITAL ALLOCATION
We continued to deliver on our commitment to returning cash to shareholders in 2015 by:
• increasing our dividend by 7 percent, the fifth increase in four years, and
• completing our $700 million share repurchase program.
We remain strongly committed to disciplined capital allocation.
OUR VISION
Two years ago, we articulated
a new vision that would guide
our journey to become truly great. We committed to focus relentlessly on operational excellence and people development and to adopt key behaviors that would transform the culture of our company.
I’m pleased with the enthusiasm and commitment our employees have shown as we work together to achieve our vision. Every day, I see efforts to integrate our key behaviors—urgency, accountability, courage, simplicity and innovation—into our daily operations. We’re also making great strides to develop our people by placing employees in stretch assignments and developing high-potential future leaders.
Our merger with Plum Creek creates even greater opportunities as we select the best practices and people from the two organizations to maximize the value of our combined company. Our portfolio changes and operational improvements are positioning Weyerhaeuser for the future, and I’m really excited about the opportunities in front of us. I look forward to sharing the next chapter of our story with you in 2016.
Thank you for your ownership and support.
