             To Our Shareholders
At the end of Fiscal 2014, we reached a critical milestone for Beazer Homes and our shareholders. For the first time since 2006, we recorded positive net income for the full year. These results reflected the sustained and disciplined efforts of our team to implement the initiatives set forth in our “Path-to-Profitability” plan, which we introduced several years ago. As pleased as we are with this achievement, the best news is that we have set the stage for future growth and expanded profitability in the years to come.
We remain confident that the gradual recovery in new home sales will gain momentum in the years ahead.
• Long-term demographic trends provide a constructive backdrop, led by the rapid expansion of “Millennial” households and the changing housing requirements of “Baby Boomers.”
• New home affordability remains robust, as low interest rates, home prices below prior peak levels and lower utility bills arising from improved energy efficiency combine to make owning a new home very accessible – and particularly compelling in light of steady increases in rental rates.
• Improvements in employment also bode well for higher levels of new home activity – particularly among first-time homebuyers.
In prior economic recoveries, these factors would have already created a more substantive housing recovery. This time, the recovery has been held back by exceptionally difficult mortgage conditions and low levels of consumer confidence, though both show signs of improvement as we enter Fiscal 2015.
Beazer Homes 2014 Annual Report

 The “2B-10” Plan
In November 2013, we outlined our next set of interim objectives: to reach $2 billion in revenue with a 10 percent EBITDA margin. We named this our “2B-10” Plan.
As we outlined at that time, reaching 2B-10 would require improvements in five key metrics including: sales per community per month, average
sales price, community count, homebuilding gross margins and cost leverage (i.e., improving the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to total revenue).We are pleased with the progress we have made so far.
Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Growth
When we introduced our 2B-10 Plan, we had just reported our Fiscal 2013 results. At that time, we had a gap of $712 million to reach $2 billion in revenue and 3.3 points in EBITDA margin to reach 10 percent. In dollar terms, we had a gap of about $114 million of Adjusted EBITDA.
Just one year later, we grew revenue 14 percent to nearly $1.5 billion, closing 25 percent of the revenue gap despite having a lower active community count virtually all year and a more challenging selling environment than we had expected. We benefited from an increase in our average selling price, which reflected some strategic changes in our business mix as well as some market-related improvements in home prices.
We did even better on profitability. With Adjusted EBITDA of $128 million for Fiscal 2014, our EBITDA margin grew to 8.8 percent, closing nearly two-thirds of the gap to reach 10 percent in EBITDA margin. Combined, the revenue growth and margin expansion allowed us to report an improvement in Adjusted EBITDA of $42 million, or almost 40 percent of the gap, in just the first year of our “2B-10” Plan.
Sales Per Community Per Month
During Fiscal 2014, our Company achieved performance above virtually our entire peer group, averaging 2.8 sales per community per month. As a result of a slower-than- expected market recovery, sales per community per month for all industry participants have been constrained.
Community Count
We ended Fiscal 2014 with 155 active communities, which was 16 percent higher than a year earlier. During the past couple of years, we significantly increased our level of land investments in an effort to grow our active community count. We purchased mostly raw and partially developed land in some of the best school districts and most active job markets in the country. As a result of these investments, we expect additional expansion in our community count this year.
Average Selling Price
An improving mix of new communities, together with improvements in home prices generally, have led to
a significant rise in our average selling price from $253 thousand last year to $285 thousand this year. The mix of our new communities is likely to drive our Fiscal year 2015 average selling price even higher.
Homebuilding Gross Margin
During Fiscal 2014, we delivered homebuilding gross margins (excluding impairments, abandonments and interest included in cost of sales) that were 190 basis points higher than a year ago, providing evidence that our efforts to improve our operations are working.
Leverage Fixed Costs
Our selling, general and administrative expenses totaled 13.3 percent of total revenue for Fiscal 2014 compared with 13.5 percent a year ago. As we bring more communities active, we anticipate our revenue will rise, allowing us to further improve our cost leverage.

 The Beazer Difference
We are constantly updating and improving the homes we offer. In fact, we believe that buying a Beazer home provides the best new home value of any offering in the industry. Specifically, we emphasize three key pillars of differentiation:
Mortgage Choice – We attempt to create a less stressful mortgage application process for our customers
by selecting a preferred set of lenders based on quality customer service, available loan programs and competitive rates. These lenders then compete to earn our customers’ business, which allows each buyer to select the right mortgage and lender for his or her purchase.
Choice Plans – With “Beazer Choice Plans,” we package the most frequently chosen floor plan options for primary living areas and provide easy ways to configure those spaces to best fit the buyer’s needs and desires – all at no additional charge.
Energy Efficiency – Beazer was an early leader and continues to build a very energy-efficient home. Every Beazer home is ENERGY STAR® certified and rated, meaning that our homeowners can save up to 30 percent on monthly energy use. In honor of our high-quality construction practices, we were very pleased to receive the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award for 2014.
Conclusion
We want to thank you for your continued support as the U.S. housing industry continues to recover from one of the deepest and longest downturns ever faced. We were very pleased to deliver profitable results for Fiscal 2014, and are confident that the steps we took to improve our operations and bring the Company back to profitability have created a foundation for further growth and additional profitability in the years ahead.
Sincerely,
Brian C. Beazer
