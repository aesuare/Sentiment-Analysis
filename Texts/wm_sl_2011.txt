To Our Shareholders, Customers, Employees and Communities:

Waste Management's success was built on the foundation of collecting and disposing of trash. Its future will be built on the ability to understand our customers' changing needs and provide targeted, innovative solutions.
A CHANGING WORLD
Not so long ago, we all viewed waste di erently than we do today. It was something to be collected and disposed of. That's all. But the world is changing. People are more aware of the need to conserve natural resources. Conscious of the millions of tons of waste David Steiner

BUILDING ON STRENGTH
Through the years, our company has worked hard to maintain a foundation of financial and operational strength, and this has served us well through di cult economic times. We drew on this strength in 2011 when the economy once again impacted our business and made for another challenging year. In 2011, our company performed well despite the economy, and we made significant progress on many important fronts by focusing on yield management, operational e ciency and providing valuable solutions for our customers. Although waste volumes were down in our landfill operations, recycling volumes were up, resulting in a record year for that important and growing business. This demonstrates clearly that customers are modifying their consumption and disposal habits to throw away less and recycle more. The financial results for the year reflect our company's continuing ability to fund its operations and pursue growth initiatives even in a less than favorable economy.

generated across North America each year, more people are stepping up to

reduce, reuse and recycle the waste in their homes, businesses and municipalities. People are thinking seriously about the impact of our society's habits on the environment. As the leading provider of comprehensive waste management services in North America, we continue to provide our customers with the essential, traditional services of collecting and managing waste in a responsible, e cient and safe manner. At the same time, we are thinking about the impact on the environment as well. With changing attitudes comes a great opportunity for our business, as well as a great opportunity to invest in cutting-edge solutions that will benefit the environment now and in the future. With decades of experience and leadership in the waste industry, Waste Management is uniquely positioned to deliver the comprehensive environmental solutions that will meet the needs of a changing world.

In 2011, we worked diligently to upgrade the systems behind customer set-up and account management, while at the same time developing the processes and measurements to resolve service issues more quickly. Throughout 2012, this will continue to be a key focus. In Phoenix, a pilot is currently underway that will give our customer service representatives the most modern communications tools, and in Pennsylvania, we're testing a new service platform that will improve the ease of doing business for our customers.

As these examples demonstrate, we constantly seek to improve the ways we meet the changing needs of our customers and enhance the experience of doing business with Waste Management.

INVESTING IN THE FUTURE
During the year, we strengthened our business through strategic acquisitions that will provide long-term benefits. In July of 2011, we acquired Oakleaf Global Holdings, which was North America's leading provider of outsourced waste services. @kYi`e^jXe\knfibf])#,''gi\]\ii\[_Xlc\ijXe[/''cXi^\ customers to our business.

Sharing Waste Management's strategic focus on sustainability and technological innovation, Oakleaf has a substantial base of national accounts customers and service relationships that provide a solid growth opportunity. The combination of the two companies will provide North American customers with unprecedented access to waste and recycling solutions by pairing the largest network of directly owned hauling, recycling, diversion and disposal assets with the largest third-party collection and service network. In addition to the Oakleaf acquisition, our investment in other acquisitions included a significant number of recycling operations and was the highest in many years, a testament to our company's strong financial position and commitment to strategic growth.

FOCUSING ON CUSTOMERS
Our knowledge of customers and their waste management needs is the foundation for our approach to driving profitable growth. We work to build collaborative relationships with our customers at all levels and provide valued environmental performance solutions. We continuously look for ways to advance technologies that reduce waste, increase recycling and reuse, create even safer treatment and disposal options, and develop sources of renewable energy. Through our innovation, we help our customers meet their sustainability goals. And together, we contribute to a more sustainable world.

FINDING MORE VALUE IN WASTE
More and more, individuals and businesses are looking for ways to reduce, reuse and recycle so that they can divert trash from landfills. We have responded to the increasing demand for environmentally sound alternatives by investing in technologies that allow us to take the materials we collect--such as yard and food waste, cardboard, glass, plastic, and even everyday trash--

and use them as valuable feedstock to generate energy or create new materials. We are finding many ways to use technology to extract more value from the materials we handle.

Also in 2011, we invested in Recycle Rewards, Inc., whose subsidiary Recyclebank® rewards people for recycling by o ering discounts and deals from local and national businesses. The investment brings together Waste Management's large national curbside collection infrastructure with Recyclebank's vast online community and incentive platform, enhancing growth prospects for both companies and motivating more people, communities and schools to recycle.

During 2011, we made many investments in emerging technologies and operations that move us closer to reaching the sustainability goals we set out to achieve by 2020. Those goals include doubling our renewable energy production to power the equivalent of 2 million homes, expanding our recycling capacity to 20 million tons per year, increasing the fuel and emission e ciency of our fleet, and enhancing wildlife habitats on our lands across North America. All these goals a rm our belief that a strategy designed to benefit the environment greatly benefits everyone--our business, our shareholders, our employees, our customers, and the communities we serve. The Waste Management of 10 years ago, a company that primarily picked up and disposed of waste, is di erent today. And in the next 10 years, we are committed to re-inventing our business again, as we continue to work with our customers, with communities, with partners and entrepreneurs, to drive the change that is needed for our changing world.
