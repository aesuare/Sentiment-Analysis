 In the fifirst full year of our second century, we worked together with accelerated pace and purpose to be the best in aerospace and an enduring global industrial champion. For a company that dreams big and delivers on those dreams, a bold, bright future is ours to seize— and we will do so, together.
2017 in Review
In 2017, more than 140,000 dedicated Boeing employees around the world delivered record company financial and operational performance, strengthened our businesses for profitable, long-term growth, and drove additional productivity and quality gains across the enterprise. Our strong performance trend—underpinned by our sizeable backlog, a large and growing aerospace and defense market, and
our positive future outlook—helped make Boeing the Dow’s top-performing company in 2017, as measured by stock price and total shareholder returns.
Company revenue in 2017 was $93.4 billion, fueled by record commercial airplane deliveries, growth in our services business, and solid defense, space and security performance. We also won $110.2 billion in net new orders for our market-leading and innovative products and services, raising our companywide backlog to $488 billion.
Core earnings per share of $12.04* for the year, also a company record, reflected our strong operating performance and a favorable tax reform impact of $1.74 per share. Core operating earnings rose 64 percent over 2016 to a Boeing-record $9.0 billion* and operating cash flow grew to an all-time high of $13.3 billion, enabling us to return significant value to our shareholders while investing for the future in our people and our business.
Keeping with our balanced cash deployment strat- egy, in 2017 we repurchased 46.1 million shares of Boeing stock for $9.2 billion and paid $3.4 billion
in dividends. In December, the Boeing Board of Directors signaled its continued confidence in our financial strength and long-term outlook, authorizing a new $18 billion share repurchase program and increasing the quarterly dividend by 20 percent. Over the past five years, we have raised our quarterly dividend by more than 250 percent.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes reported
$56.7 billion of revenue in 2017 and led the industry in deliveries for the sixth consecutive year with a record 763 airplanes. With net new orders for an additional 912 airplanes, we grew our commercial airplanes backlog to a company record of 5,864 jets. This strong order book, worth $421 billion, is equal to approximately seven years of production at current rates. Full-year operating margins were 9.6 percent.
The 737 family continues to exceed expectations
in the single-aisle market, with 745 net new orders received and a company record of 529 airplanes delivered in 2017. Our 737 backlog now stands at more than 4,600 airplanes. In 2017, we also transi- tioned our production system smoothly to the
737 MAX, allowing us to deliver the first 74 737 MAX 8 airplanes while increasing overall 737 production
to 47 aircraft per month. We continued to make progress building out the MAX family, including the start of production on the 737 MAX 7, the rollout
and first flight of the 737 MAX 9 and the launch of
the 737 MAX 10, the largest plane in the MAX family. The MAX 9 is scheduled to enter service this year. With more than 4,300 orders from 92 customers worldwide, the 737 MAX is the fastest-selling airplane

                 in Boeing’s history, and we believe it has additional growth potential.
We also extended our market and technology lead in the high-value twin-aisle segment with significant progress on the 787 and 777 programs. We contin- ued building 787s at the highest production rate for a twin-aisle jet (12 airplanes per month), leading to 136 deliveries for the year from our production facilities
in Everett, Washington, and North Charleston, South Carolina. We completed rollout and first flight of the 787-10, the third and largest Dreamliner model, and soon will deliver the first airplane to launch customer Singapore Airlines. At the end of 2017, the worldwide operating fleet of 636 787 Dreamliners had flown
2.8 billion miles, carried 210 million passengers and opened more than 170 new nonstop city pairs.
Our newest twin-aisle airplane, the 777X, remains on track to enter service in 2020. In 2017, we began producing parts for the first flight-test airplane in
our Composite Wing Center in Everett. Our current backlog of 340 orders and commitments from seven global customers remains strong as interest in the airplane’s unsurpassed efficiency continues to grow. We also expect increased demand for widebody replacements early in the next decade.
Building on our industry-record deliveries in 2017, we remain on track to increase production even further over the next few years to more than 900 airplanes annually, based on previously announced rate increases. Our plans include raising the 737 produc- tion rate from the current 47 airplanes per month to 52 in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. And with more than 650 firm orders in our Dreamliner backlog, our plan to increase 787 production from 12 airplanes per month today to 14 in 2019 is well supported.
Production rates on the 747, 767 and 777 are set
to continue at existing levels in 2018. Continued improvements in the cargo market, as evidenced by an order for 14 additional 747-8 Freighters from UPS in early 2018, support our 0.5 airplane per month rate. Production of 2.5 767s per month is supported by continued demand for commercial freighters
and military aerial refueling tankers. On 777, as we transition to production of the 777X, we expect a delivery rate of roughly 3.5 per month in 2018 and 2019. For the current-generation 777, we received 40 net new orders in 2017, bringing the backlog to 102 as progress continues on the 777 to 777X bridge.
The commercial airplane market remains large and growing, valued at $2.8 trillion over the next decade. Passenger traffic continues to outpace expectations and demand for new airplanes remains high. We esti- mate customers will buy more than 41,000 airplanes over the next 20 years, including approximately 9,100 widebodies, as more people travel by air, particularly in the rapidly growing Asia region. This long-term demand forecast, coupled with healthy market conditions and a robust backlog, provides a solid foundation for our planned production rates.
Boeing Defense, Space & Security achieved continued success in 2017, recording healthy revenue and margins, winning important new orders and logging significant program milestones, including progress on the KC-46 tanker. Revenues were
$21.1 billion with operating margins of 10.6 percent. In total, we delivered four commercial and military satellites, 170 military aircraft and 35,618 weapons systems. New orders worth $28.8 billion reinforced our $50 billion backlog, which includes a balanced mix of U.S. and international customers.

                 Noteworthy defense-related accomplishments in 2017 include:
A $3.4 billion multiyear contract for 268 AH-64E Apache helicopters and a $3.4 billion order for at least 27 P-8 Poseidon aircraft for the United States, Australia and United Kingdom.
A contract to provide 36 F-15 fighter jets to Qatar.
Successful downselect to design the United States’ next intercontinental ballistic missile.
FAA certification of the 767-2C aircraft, verifying that the fundamental design of the KC-46 tanker is safe and reliable, the inaugural flight of the
first tanker destined for the U.S. Air Force, and a contract to build a new tanker for Japan—the first international KC-46 customer.
A successful Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system intercept test and the ahead- of-schedule emplacement of the 44th GMD interceptor at Ft. Greely, Alaska.
We also extended our leadership in the increasingly competitive space market with several achievements:
Successful completion of CST-100 Starliner drop tests and design certification review.
Welding of the five hardware structures that form Space Launch System’s 212-foot-tall (64.6 m) core stage—the backbone of the rocket that will carry the first humans to Mars.
Launch of seven satellites and the X-37B reusable, autonomous spacecraft.
Eight successful launches by our United Launch Alliance joint venture.
A NASA contract to develop a deep-space habita- tion concept.
While our global defense and space customers continue to balance constrained budgets and rapidly evolving threats, we are seeing solid demand for
our products and services in a market valued at
$2.2 trillion over the next 10 years. Our ongoing pursuit of improved affordability and productivity, as well as strong performance across our core business areas—weapons, fixed-wing strike and integrated missile systems—have us well positioned to fund our future. This foundational work is allowing us to invest in growth markets, such as commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, satellites, services, human space explo- ration and autonomous systems, while competing
for exciting new programs including the T-X trainer, MQ-25 unmanned aerial refueling aircraft and the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent.
In July 2017, our third major business unit, Boeing Global Services, started operations to provide more agile, cost-effective and streamlined after- market support and services, help address our customers’ increased focus on aircraft readiness and value-based life-cycle solutions, and secure a larger share of the 10-year, $2.6 trillion—and growing— commercial and government services market. Because we produce roughly half of the world’s com- mercial and defense fleets, and aircraft service life is increasing, aerospace services represents one of our biggest growth opportunities for the future.
Boeing Global Services got off to a strong start in 2017 with revenue of $14.6 billion and operating margins of 15.4 percent, reflecting solid execution and portfolio diversity. Our services backlog stands at $17.2 billion. Year-on-year growth of 5 percent outpaced the average services market growth rate of 3.5 percent, an outcome we strive to repeat in the coming years as we expand our services offerings and grow market share.
Our services expertise, the global reach of our busi- ness and our strong customer partnerships have us well positioned to compete and win for the long-term in areas such as spare parts; maintenance, modifica- tions and upgrades; training; and, increasingly, digital solutions, which generated approximately $1 billion in revenue in 2017.
Early key wins include:
An F-15 sustainment contract for Qatar.
An order for seven 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters for GECAS.
A 787 landing gear exchange agreement with All Nippon Airways.
A P-8I training agreement with India.
Accelerating Our Pace of Progress
In 2017, driven in part by a global business environ- ment that is growing more competitive by the day, we promoted a productive sense of urgency at all levels of the company to accelerate the pace of our innovation.
Succeeding in rapidly changing global markets requires that we think and do things differently. It demands change, a willingness to embrace it and the agility to both drive and respond to external forces. The com- petition is not standing still, and neither are we.
Over the past year, we made several strategic invest- ments to better position ourselves for future markets and growth. We stood up Boeing Global Services to expand our share of the aerospace services market.
              7

                 We continued to develop new commercial, defense and space products and services such as the
787-10 and 777X, the KC-46 tanker and T-X trainer aircraft, and the CST-100 Starliner and Space Launch System. We took steps to strengthen our capabilities in areas such as data analytics, avionics, actuation and additive manufacturing—high-value work that benefits from our internal expertise and global scale. We launched our Boeing HorizonX innovation cell and formed partnerships with several companies whose technology can change the competitive landscape. We acquired Aurora Flight Sciences to bolster our autonomous-flight portfolio.
As we shape our business for a second century of aerospace innovation, we continue to make meaning- ful progress toward building a zero-injury workplace, achieving world-class quality and creating the kind
of culture that breaks down organizational barriers, eliminates bureaucracy and unleashes the full capa- bilities of our people.
Looking ahead to 2018 and beyond, we remain focused on winning through innovation, driving growth and productivity and extending our position as the world’s leading aerospace company—all while deliv- ering the best value to our customers, employees and shareholders.
Our Enduring Values
The importance of our purpose and mission demands that we work with the utmost integrity and excellence and embrace the enduring values that define who we are today and the company we aspire to be tomorrow. These core values—integrity, quality, safety, diversity and inclusion, trust and respect, corporate citizenship and stakeholder success—remind us all that how we do our work is every bit as important as the work itself.
Living these values also means being best-in-class in community and environmental stewardship.
In 2017, Boeing and its employees and retirees contributed a total of $181 million—in addition to time and talent—to help strengthen communities worldwide. We also revamped our approach to corporate citizenship with the launch of Boeing Global Engagement. This new approach takes a companywide, strategic view of our investments and employee engagement activities by focusing on our commitment to science, technology, engineering and math education as well as military veterans—more than 20,000 of whom we are proud to call Boeing teammates. This renewed focus is helping us deepen relationships and inspire positive, lasting change in the places we call home.
Additionally, every day, Boeing employees advance efforts to improve the environmental efficiency and performance of our products and services, reduce emissions and conserve water and resources. To date, we have tested nearly 70 technologies on our ecoDemonstrator program with another 30 planned in 2018. We also further collaborated with outside experts to help identify and deliver stormwater man- agement and water-quality improvements. Finally, even as aircraft production hits record levels, our goal remains zero growth in greenhouse gas emissions, water use, hazardous waste (normalized to revenue) and solid waste sent to landfills.
Achieving Our Bold Aspiration
Boeing is stronger, more innovative and more focused than ever in our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world. I believe we have the industry’s best team, the right products, services and strategies, and a compelling vision that defines who we are as
a company, where we are headed and how we are going to win.
As encouraging as our performance was in 2017,
I am even more excited about what lies ahead— countless opportunities to build upon our storied legacy, exceed customer and stakeholder expecta- tions and claim Boeing’s position among the world’s best companies, regardless of industry.
We are intensely focused on delivering consistently on our customer commitments and commercial, defense and space development programs, capturing new business and winning key campaigns, growing our new integrated services business, pursuing breakthrough technologies that will strengthen our innovation engine, and further investing in our people.
Since my early days as an engineering intern at Boeing more than 30 years ago, I have viewed this great company with a sense of wonder—in the prod- ucts we design, build and support, in the important mission we serve and in the talented, passionate people around the world who I now have the honor of leading. Our second century is off to a fast start, and I look forward to you joining us on the incredible journey that awaits.
