The Pharmaceutical Industry is governed by the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO), 1995. Announcement of the new Drugs (Prices Control) Order based on the new Drug Policy announced in 2002 has been delayed resulting in continuing uncertainties for the Industry. Lack of product patent has led to launch of generic versions of the patented products. Passing of the required legislation to comply with the WTO commitments of having product patent in place by January 2005 is eagerly awaited. FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE During the year ended 31st March, 2004, pharma sales were Rs. 281.08 crores. The domestic sales recorded a growth of 7.6%. Major therapeutic segments such as Oral Contraceptives, Anti-Infectives, Steroids and Vaccines continue to perform well in their respective segments. Exports for the year at Rs. 25.13 crores are lower than previous year (Rs. 27.41 crores) due to lower demand for Medrogestone. Sales of Consumer Healthcare products were Rs. 32.42 crores (previous year Rs. 31.37 crores). The sales growth excluding Forhans is 10.5%. Divestment of the Forhans business including the Factory at Nashik was approved by the shareholders during the current year. Discussions with the buyer, John Oak Remedies Pvt. Ltd., are in progress for completing the transaction. Excluding the impact of Voluntary Retirement Scheme payments and tax, profit for the year is Rs. 79.00 crores as compared to Rs. 61.82 crores in the previous year, which represents an increase of 27.8%. The increase in profit is due to higher sales and implementation of cost reduction programs. The Board of Directors has approved the sale of the Company's factory at Ghatkopar during the current year. OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS, RISKS AND CONCERNS The Company continues to focus on its core products with a dedicated sales force and sees good opportunities for its Core products such as Antibiotics, Oral Contraceptives, Steroids and Vaccines. One of the biggest opportunities for the Company is ready access to the pipeline of new products of Wyeth, USA. During the year, the Company launched ENBRELTM which is a breakthrough treatment for Rheumatoid Arthritis and the response to this product has been encouraging. The Company also launched during the year, RAPAMUNETM, an immunosuppressant for prevention of rejection after renal transplantation, which is doing well. The Company is developing its strategy for the launch of OTC products through its Consumer Healthcare Division. The Company continues to be adversely impacted by the launch of the generic version of patented molecules by other companies. The claims under the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account and the comment of the Auditors regarding the amount payable into the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account have been explained at length in Note 4(a) to the Accounts. An early resolution of this issue will provide much needed clarity for future planning. OUTLOOK The Company sees a good future based on its current portfolio and new products launch program. The Company plans to introduce new products in both Pharma and OTC segments and will continue to focus on its core areas with continued emphasis on stringent cost management efforts. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS The Company has adequate internal control systems with appropriate control checks. Effective measures have been taken to ensure that all assets of the Company are protected and all transactions are recorded in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The Internal Audit department regularly conducts a review of the financial and operating controls in all areas of the Company's operations including transaction checks and significant issues, if any, are brought to the attention of the Audit Committee of the Board.
