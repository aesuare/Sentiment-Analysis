HUNTSMAN CORPORATION 1

PETER R. HUNTSMAN: A LETTER TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS
2015 WAS A TRANSITION YEAR FOR OUR COMPANY, DURING WHICH WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. WE SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES THAT POSITION US FOR FUTURE LONG-TERM PROSPERITY, INCLUDING INCREASED CAPITAL INVESTMENTS, SIGNIFICANT RESTRUCTURING AND MEANINGFUL ASSET MAINTENANCE. NOTWITHSTANDING A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC BACKDROP, WE DELIVERED STRONG FINANCIAL RESULTS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAINS SOLID.
Our business operated at two different speeds in 2015. With the fall of crude prices, the North American gas advantage substantially diminished. This put downward pressure on margins for cyclical chemicals such as MTBE, olefins and other basic commodity chemicals. Combined with lower global economic growth and challenging industry conditions for titanium dioxide, earnings for our cyclical products decreased. Lower earnings from cyclical chemicals overshadowed the tremendous strides we achieved improving our downstream differentiated businesses, such as MDI urethanes, epoxies and amines. In 2015, our downstream differentiated businesses grew more than 10% and generated more than 80% of our operational earnings. This difference in performance underscores the need for portfolio management. The earnings volatility we have seen in our titanium dioxide business is one of the primary reasons we continue to actively pursue a separation of this business through a spinoff or other strategic transaction. I believe that improving our free cash flow generation profile is the single most significant objective we can achieve to create stockholder value. In 2015, we spent over $850 million completing our pigments restructuring and integration, and a number of global projects, including a once-every-five-year maintenance project. Let me reiterate our objectives. Moving forward, we will improve free cash flow generation, grow our downstream differentiated businesses and actively pursue a separation of our titanium dioxide business. We are well prepared to deliver on these objectives. Thank you for your support. In 2016, we plan to decrease our capital expenditures by $200 million, we'll spend $100 million less in restructuring and $50 million less in operations, as we do not have any large maintenance projects planned. As a result, we expect our free cash flow to improve by $350 million in 2016. We project further increases in subsequent years as we remain focused on improving free cash flow. We continue to improve our personal and process safety. Our safety and environmental performance is rated among the best in our industry.
