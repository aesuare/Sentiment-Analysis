To Our Shareholders
With nearly 3,000 stores added to the chain in the last ten fiscal years, Family Dollar has experienced explosive growth. And with 30 consecutive quarters of record sales and earnings on a comparable quarter basis, our growth has been consistent and profitable. Family Dollar has come a long way since the opening of the first store in 1959, and while we celebrate milestones such as the opening of the 5,000th store in August 2003, our focus always is on the opportunities ahead. The statement on the cover page of this Annual Report that "We've still got a long way to grow!" captures this focus. Our Company's performance in fiscal 2003, coupling the highest sales and earnings in our history with record levels of reinvestment in our business, positions Family Dollar for continued profitable growth. Highlights of Fiscal 2003 The year ended August 30, 2003, was highlighted by:  Gains in sales of 14.1%, including a 3.8% increase in existing store sales  Growth in net income of 14.1%  Net addition of 411 new stores, increasing the number of stores in operation at fiscal year-end to 5,027  Planning and beginning implementation of a multi-year "Store of the Future" project  Opening on-time, on-budget in Odessa, Texas, of a stateof-the-art, automated distribution center  Increase in cash dividends declared per share of Common Stock of 13.7%  Strengthening our Company's financial condition, with a balance sheet at fiscal year-end with no debt Fiscal 2003 Operating Results Sales for the fifty-two weeks in the fiscal year ended August 30, 2003, were $4,750.2 million, or 14.1% above sales of $4,162.7 million for the fifty-two weeks in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2002.

Investments In fiscal 2003, Family Dollar continued to invest in the future of our Company. We committed significant resources towards key initiatives, including new store openings and store focused technology. Four hundred seventy-five new stores were added to the chain, including the first stores in Wyoming and North Dakota. Sixty-four stores were closed bringing the total number of stores in operation at the end of the fiscal year on August 30, 2003, to 5,027 stores in 43 states. million for fiscal 2003, or 14.1% above net income of $216.9 million for fiscal 2002, and net income per diluted share increased to $1.43 from $1.25. In a challenging retail sales environment, in fiscal 2003 sales in existing stores increased approximately 3.8%. This included increases of about 4.3% in sales of hardlines and about 2.1% in sales of softlines. The average transaction increased about 1.6% to $8.87, and the customer count, as measured by the number of register transactions in existing stores, increased about 1.9%. Several merchandising initiatives contributed to the sales gains in fiscal 2003. Over the past several seasons, our apparel departments have done an outstanding job of raising quality standards while at the same time hitting the low-end price points our customers need. As a result, we reported in fiscal 2003 increases in softline sales in existing stores for the first time since fiscal 1999. We expect this momentum to continue in fiscal 2004. We have taken this same focus on quality to our home departments (mainly domestics, housewares and giftware) with promising initial results. Today, not only are the goods a higher quality, they are better coordinated and more consistent with fashions seen in higher end retailers. In both the apparel and home departments, we are doing a better job of meeting our customers' needs for fashionable yet affordable merchandise. Consumables continue to represent a large and growing part of our business. Investments in our supply chain in recent years have positioned us to more aggressively manage inventory turns in this area. This provides us with opportunities to expand our merchandise assortments to drive existing store sales without increasing overall inventory. The continued expansion of name brand products also supports our quality image. Last fiscal year, nationally advertised brand merchandise accounted for 35% of sales. We also announced a series of initiatives under the umbrella of what we call the "Store of the Future." The objective is to build an infrastructure that will provide the capability to improve the shopping experience for our customers while simplifying processes for our Associates. These initiatives will take several years to fully implement. One immediate result is that beginning in November 2003 customers are able to use PIN-based debit cards in most stores. We also are currently testing a software system that will streamline the hiring process and give us consistency in pre-employment assessments and interviewing. The infrastructure investments also provide a foundation for more interactive communications with the stores, putting us in a position, for example, to introduce computer assisted training. Fiscal year 2003 also marked the opening in Odessa, Texas, of our seventh distribution center. We open our state-ofthe-art distribution facilities using proven processes that permit us to rapidly ramp-up new centers to full-service standards. Finally, we invested in the senior management team with a number of promotions and new hires. Most notably, David Alexander, who has assumed increasing responsibilities since he joined Family Dollar in 1995, succeeded me as President in January 2003. David's leadership ability is a great asset to our Company. Financial Condition and Dividend Growth Despite a challenging retail sales environment in fiscal 2003, Family Dollar continued to strengthen its financial condition. The Company maintains its 44-year history of no long-term debt, and there also was no short-term debt outstanding at any time during fiscal 2003. Family Dollar's financial strength is reflected by the growth of cash dividends. The first quarterly cash dividend was paid in fiscal 1976, and dividends have been increased in

each of the succeeding 27 years. In fiscal 2003, cash dividends declared per share of Common Stock increased 13.7% from $.25 1/2 to $.29. Repurchase of Common Stock In October 2002, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase from time to time, as market conditions warrant, of up to 5 million shares of the Company's Common Stock. The Board took such action in the belief that the Common Stock is a good investment and the repurchase program builds value for shareholders. In fiscal 2003, we purchased 2.2 million shares at a cost of $65.9 million. Fiscal 2004 Outlook Building on the remarkable legacy left by Founder and Chairman Emeritus Leon Levine upon his retirement in January 2003, Family Dollar continues its consistent record of performance. Our financial strength permits us to make substantial investments in our Company's future.

In fiscal 2004, we plan to open approximately 565 new stores, expand or relocate about 125 stores, close about 60 stores, begin construction of an eighth distribution center, and continue investing in our Associates and in technology. Initiatives in fiscal 2004, as discussed above, include store focused technology infrastructure investments to bring more value and convenience to our customers. We do, indeed, still have a long way to grow, and through sound investments and the dedicated efforts of all Associates, our Company will continue to gain market share and build upon its record of profitable growth.
