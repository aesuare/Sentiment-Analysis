The year 2007 was one of great successes for Spirit AeroSystems. Although we can proudly trace our roots back more than three-quarters of a century to the still-early days of aviation manufacturing, we have, in reality, only been a stand-alone company for fewer than three years.
During that time, we have diligently executed the strategy we originally articulated, and last year, organizationally, operationally and financially, Spirit took more great strides forward. We increased our business momentum while also achieving strong performances across the Company, meeting our program commitments, adding to our customer base, developing new products, and extending our design, engineering, production and technological capabilities. As a result, we are very proud that Spirit AeroSystems is recognized as a leading supplier of aerostructures. Just as importantly, our entire Spirit team is committed to keeping it that way. 2007: A Year of Strategic Achievements Throughout 2007, we successfully executed our business plan, aimed at creating quality products and value for our customers, while enhancing our partnerships with suppliers and positioning the Company for sustainable long-term growth. Working together smoothly as the "new" Spirit team, we increased sales and earnings, we established strategic new market relationships, we won major new customers and we extended our technological presence. During the year: Spirit's program shipments to existing customers grew substantially. Fuselage shipset deliveries rose year-over-year across every Boeing model, growing in total by 14 percent, from 392 to 446 units. Likewise, wing sections delivered to Airbus and Hawker Beechcraft through Spirit

Europe (acquired in April 2006) also increased across all aircraft families. In addition, Boeing and Airbus received more than 2,700 new net orders, outpacing total 2007 shipments by more than 3 to 1 and increasing our backlog by 38 percent to a record $26.5 billion at year-end. We achieved key manufacturing milestones: increasing the B737 fuselage production rate to a record level; delivering the 2,500th all-time B737 shipset, the 1,400th B747 forward fuselage and the 700th B777 forward section; and entering production on our first P-8A Poseidon (a B737-8 derivative) assembly line aircraft during the fourth quarter. In February, we began assembly of the first production all-composite forward fuselage section for our B787 Dreamliner program , culminating in May with its delivery to Boeing for their final assembly of a complete test aircraft.

Leading yet another advance in aircraft composites technology, we shipped a one-piece composite, 360-degree inlet cowl, conceived, designed and constructed by our Propulsion Systems segment specifically for Boeing's 747-8 jetliner engines. On the new business front, we negotiated new contracts with Sikorsky to develop major structural components for the CH-53K heavy-lift helicopter and with Boeing for the new P-8A fuselage program. We joined the Cessna Joint Concept Team to build the fuselage for their new largecabin business jet. In addition, we signed new agreements with suppliers in China, Korea and Turkey, bolstering our global business mix. In November, Spirit announced two significant initiatives to further expand the Company's global profile. The Company will establish a manufacturing presence in Malaysia, our first in the Asia-Pacific region, to supply wing component

In 2007, the Spirit team performed well on existing work, increasing production rates and deliveries to customers. We extended our global presence into Russia and Malaysia and established new business relationships with Sikorsky, Cessna, and suppliers in China, Korea and Turkey, and we enhanced the MRO services we provide worldwide.

subassemblies to Spirit's other production centers. Spirit also signed a joint venture agreement with Progresstech LTD, to establish a new consulting and engineering services company to be based in Moscow, Russia. The collaboration will give us access to new talent and technologies to help support our business development efforts and growing worldwide customer base. Lastly, the Company expanded its aftermarket business, including the areas of spare parts, fleet support and MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) services. In 2007, Spirit added more than 100 new aftermarket customers, while initiating Aviall as our exclusive spare parts distributor outside of North America. Teaming with Nordam, we won a contract from Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific to repair 10 B777 Trent 800 thrust reverser halves. In April, Spirit was designated by Boeing to repair and overhaul nacelles and thrust reversers for B737NGs and B777s as part of Boeing's Component Services Network. And in November, Spirit announced that it will open a repair station in its Prestwick, Scotland, facility to provide thrust reverser MRO services beginning in mid-2008, in support of aircraft operators in Europe and the Middle East.

2007: Strong Financial Performance In 2007, the Company's financial results successfully matched stride for stride our substantial operating achievements ­ in increased sales, profit margin, operating and net income, and earnings per share, while at the same time strengthening our balance sheet. For the full year, Spirit AeroSystems reported strong top-line growth, with total revenue increasing by 20 percent to almost $3.9 billion, up from $3.2 billion in 2006. The 2006 sales include Spirit Europe for only the nine months subsequent to its acquisition on April 1 of that year. With more product shipments throughout the Company in 2007, each of our operating segments ­ Fuselage Systems, Propulsion Systems and Wing Systems ­ contributed to the year-over-year revenue gain. In 2007, Spirit booked operating income of $419 million (yielding a 10.9 percent operating margin) as compared to a full-year operating loss of $(56) million in 2006. The principal reason for the 2006 reported loss was a nonrecurring expense of approximately $330 million related to the Company's November 2006 Initial Public

SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS, INC. ANNUAL REPORT 2007

Offering. Reflecting the economies of scale of increasing volumes, the Company's 2007-over2006 percentage change in operating income, before nonrecurring charges, outpaced revenue growth. The Company reported net income of $297 million in 2007 and $17 million in 2006, with the latter results again affected by the nonrecurring IPO charges mentioned above. Corresponding fully diluted earnings per share were $2.13 and $0.14, respectively. During 2007, the Company achieved strong cash generation from its legacy programs, much of which was reinvested in the new B787 program. Capital expenditures during the year totaled $288 million, covering planned investments in property,

plant and equipment to increase production capacity and support our B787 program start-up. Our strong operating results translated into a substantially strengthened balance sheet overall. Long-term debt declined by $23 million for yearend 2007 as compared to 2006, while year-end shareholders' equity increased 48 percent from $859 million to $1,267 million. As a result, our net debt to capital ratio declined to 27 percent at year-end 2007 versus 34 percent at year-end 2006. Spirit successfully achieved compliance with its 2007 requirements mandated by the SarbanesOxley Act of 2002. The Act requires publicly traded companies and their auditors to report on and certify as to the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting.

Total 2007 revenue increased by 20 percent to $3.9 billion. The operating margin was 10.9 percent, and fully diluted earnings per share totaled $2.13, compared to $0.14 in 2006.

Readers may refer to the Form 10-K portion of this Annual Report for more extensive detail on Spirit AeroSystems' 2007 financial results, including Management's Discussion and Analysis and the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Looking to 2008 and Beyond As we look ahead to 2008 and beyond, Spirit's fortunes are, unquestionably, closely tied to those of the aviation industry as a whole. Since our formation in mid-2005, we have benefited from a very strong industry environment in which the aircraft OEMs have posted records for orders received, production rates achieved and new aircraft delivered. And as the leading aerostructures manufacturer, Spirit's business has shared directly in this worldwide aviation prosperity.

While our industry is cyclical, it is a cycle around a positive long-term trend line. We serve a fundamentally growing aviation market in which long-term expansion of worldwide GDP (Gross Domestic Product) should continue to fuel an increasing demand for air travel. And more air travel will, in turn, induce a growing aerospace supply base to meet OEM deliveries, backed by new orders for aircraft. For Spirit, our clear objective is to take full advantage of all industry upsides while mitigating as much as possible any potential downsides. We are confident that we have positioned the Company to successfully meet any changes that may come, whether expected or not. In short, we are building Spirit to achieve long-term value creation regardless of the aerospace environment we encounter. On January 16, 2008, Boeing announced a threemonth shift of B787 Dreamliner production, with first customer deliveries now pushed back to early 2009. While the introduction of the new aircraft has been delayed, we remain pleased with Spirit's overall performance on the project. We are busy coordinating with the other program suppliers and readying for our ramp-up of production as required to fully support Boeing's revised schedule. While the delay may affect our 2008 sales, earnings and working capital requirements, our solid book of business gives us confidence that Spirit will report strong growth for the year regardless of the B787 scheduling.

Our Strategy for Growth Whether we call it "Diversification, Globalization and Technology" or just, more simply, developing "new customers, products, markets and processes," at Spirit AeroSystems these phrases are more than merely idealistic concepts and buzzwords. They represent our core strategies for creating value. They underlie, in fact, not only our efforts and many achievements during 2007, our first full year as a public company, but, more importantly, they also denote the well-planned roadmaps we are following toward our future. We believe it is a future of bright prospects for the aviation industry and of even greater opportunities and prospects for Spirit AeroSystems. We will continue to do our utmost as a company to meet our customers' demands, to support OEM programs and to diligently pursue and win new business. In the pages that follow, we describe how we are turning our goals into accomplished business realities. We firmly believe that our strategies are already paying off. And through the hard work and dedication of our unique Spirit team, we fully expect to continue creating substantial value for our stakeholders, employees, customers, suppliers and communities for years to come.
