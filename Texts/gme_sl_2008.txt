In 2008, we continued our international growth.
 
Three important acquisitions bolstered our presence in Europe and Australia. In March, we purchased the 49-store chain Free Record Shops in Norway and
   
gives us a total of more than 160 stores throughout Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland. Our purchase of New Zealand's largest independent gaming specialist, The Gamesman, brought our total store count in Australia/New Zealand to 350.
 


In parallel, we executed a series of educational outreach campaigns in both English and Spanish, targeting parents and other gift-givers. For GameStop, our success is rooted in giving consumers the information and choices needed to make the most appropriate decisions on what is appropriate for each individual family.
 

Our  final  acquisition  in  2008  enabled  GameStop  to secure a major growing foothold in Europe. The purchase of Micromania, France's leading video game retailer, gave us 332 locations throughout the country. Prior to the Micromania deal, GameStop did not have a presence in France.

Sackboy Â· Little Big Planet
Little Big Planet is the title that redefined the word "game"' and reexamined the relationship between designers and players. Ostensibly a cooperative puzzle-solving game starring the loveable Sackboy, it was actually an amazingly realistic physics engine and design medium. Players were given full access to a wide range of tools, materials, textures and objects with which to construct their own environments and puzzles. They could then share their creations with the rest of the online community, transforming the players into designers and the game into a continually evolving experience.
