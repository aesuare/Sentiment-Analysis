To Our Shareholders
2012 was one of the most successful years in Discover’s history. We achieved record net income, organic growth in all of our lending products, record volume on our networks, and a very strong return on equity. We also established new partnerships in payments, diversified our direct banking product offerings, and demonstrated our commitment to returning excess capital to shareholders via stock repurchases and dividends.
We are focused on being the leading direct bank and payments partner, and our results in 2012 are proof that our strategy and business model are working. Today, we are successful and profitable— and gaining market share. We are causing people to think about the Discover brand in new ways, which is leading to new opportunities for your company. Accordingly, we will continue to build on
the Discover brand by further expanding our suite of direct banking products, and by partnering in payments with other innovative companies and financial institutions around the world.
  
                 “Our results in 2012 are proof that our ” strategy and business model are working.
2012 Highlights included:
• Net income of $2.3 billion, or $4.46 per diluted share, and return on equity of 26%
• Ending loan growth of 6%
• Record low credit card delinquency and charge-off rates
• Network volume of $306 billion, including $105 billion in Discover card sales volume
• Strong expansion of merchant acceptance, domestically and around the world
• Repurchase of 6% of our outstanding common stock and a 40% higher quarterly dividend declared in December 2012
We also leveraged the power of our brand and the commitment of Discover employees to invest for future growth as we launched Discover Home Loans, introduced the Discover it card, and announced payments relationships with PayPal and with major financial institutions in Russia, China, India and elsewhere.
Defining Direct Banking
Our credit card business is the cornerstone of our direct banking operations, and the Discover brand is
known for rewards, service and value in
the card industry. We have built on our brand by expanding into private student loans, personal loans, home loans, savings accounts and certificates of deposit, and now checking accounts. In many ways, Discover is defining what it means to be a “direct bank” by providing not just the products that
customers want, but by also providing an outstanding customer experience.
Our Discover card accomplishments in 2012 included:
• Loan growth of 6%
• Sales growth of 5%
• Net principal charge-off rate of 2.62%
• Launch of the Discover it card
In 2012, we successfully grew credit card sales and loans in a challenging environment by increasing our wallet share with existing customers and achieving double-digit new account growth. We increased customer engagement through our rewards program and marketing initiatives, and by expanding our best-in- class online and mobile capabilities. We also increased merchant participation in our rewards program, which provides additional value for our cardmembers.
We believe that our strong loan and sales growth demonstrate the effectiveness of our marketing programs, consumers’ preference for cash rewards, and the success of our acceptance and awareness initiatives. Our industry-leading prime credit underwriting and loan management capabilities contributed to remarkably strong credit results.
Our focus going forward is to continue to grow Discover card loans while maintaining superb credit quality. In 2012, Discover grew faster than our peer competitors on average, and card loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2012
 
                 was the highest it has been in more than five years. We are doing several things to build on that momentum going forward, including the rollout of the Discover it card nationwide, enhancing and expanding our cash rewards program, and leveraging innovations in mobile offers, e-commerce and customer service.
I believe the Discover it card is the most innovative new credit card to be introduced by the industry in years. Discover it provides cardmembers with a unique set of benefits, including no late fee for the first late payment, job loss support, payment flexibility, and a special customer service experience. I am very excited about this new card, and believe it will contribute to new account and wallet share growth
for Discover.
We also expect our cash rewards program to help us achieve loan growth.
More U.S. households have a Discover card than any other cash rewards card (TNS 2012 Consumer Card Strategies Research), and as we enter our 27th year, we have
“i believe the Discover it card is the most innovative new credit card to be introduced by the industry in years.”
rewarded cardmembers with more than
$11 billion in cash rewards. In 2013, we will make our cash rewards program even better with higher cash rewards on purchases using Discover it, integrated programs with retail category leaders, the rollout of additional online/mobile functionality, and efforts
to increase cardmember participation in existing programs.

                 One of the pillars of the Discover brand is service. Our goal is to build a stronger relationship with each customer interaction. We provide 100% of our customer service with our own employees at U.S. locations. We regard that as a competitive advantage, because every call is an opportunity to promotecardusageandincreasecustomer loyalty, and we believe that no one can
do that better than our employees. In fact, we believe so strongly in our employees
that we have implemented a program
called “iShine,” which is designed
to let the enthusiasm and individual personalities of our employees “shine” through during interactions with customers, resulting in more natural, more engaging conversations. Our approach is making
a difference, as evidenced by increased card usage by cardmembers following interactions with our account managers,

In June 2012, we further expanded our suite of direct banking products with the launch of Discover Home Loans. Our goal is to become a market leader in direct home loan originations, and one of the ways we are going to accomplish that goal is by doing better than our competitors at helping customers navigate the complex process of obtaining a mortgage.
During 2012, we also developed what we believe will be one of the best checking account values in the industry. Discover Cashback Checking, now in limited release, rewards customers for every debit card, online bill payment and check transaction. Our checking account also has a unique
set of customer benefits, including
ease-of-use with advanced online and mobile functionality, no monthly fee, no minimum balance, access to a nationwide group of no-fee ATMs and free checks.

Our Payment Services accomplishments in 2012 included:
• Volumegrowthof12%acrossour Payment Services segment
• Pretax income growth of 9%
• Record number of active merchants accepting Discover transactions
• Significant new domestic and international partners
The relationship between Discover and PayPal is a prime example of how Discover is innovating in the emerging payments landscape by supporting new technologies and nontraditional methods of payment
to facilitate commerce. In 2012, we announced plans to make PayPal available at millions of brick-and-mortar locations across the United States starting in 2013. We expect our collaboration to increase network volume and give merchants even more reason to accept payments through our network.
Discover has also expanded significantly in international markets by signing innovative network-to-network agreements. Our current “net-to-net” partners include UnionPay (China), JCB (Japan), BC Card (Korea), RuPay (India), ATH (Puerto Rico), and others.
In 2012, we expanded our relationship with Russian Standard Bank, which
was already a partner as a Diners Club International franchise, and is now going to
issue Discover cards in Russia and Ukraine. In addition, we completed an agreement with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China to issue Diners Club cards
in China.
We are also working closely with
acquirer partners in the United States and around the world to continue increasing merchant acceptance. In the United States, we have increased the number of active merchants by 47% since 2006. In international markets, we have widened our acceptance footprint substantially over the past few years to include many of
the top 25 travel destinations worldwide. Cardmembers also can now enjoy unprecedented cash access at more than 850,000 ATMs in more than 100 countries around the world.
In our PULSE ATM/debit network, we achieved continued volume growth in 2012, and we are innovating to respond to competitive challenges in the debit market. For example, PULSE is promoting Discover Debit, a signature debit product with broad national acceptance, a competitive rate and fee structure, and flexibility to customize the front of the card with a focus on the
issuer’s brand.
The Power of a Brand
Over the past several years, your company has demonstrated the power of the Discover brand. We have expanded our product offerings and market share
in direct banking. We have grown in
the payments industry by being the best partner in the industry. We have produced
 
                 record financial results and strong returns to shareholders. And we have received awards and recognition from many organizations, including being ranked #1 in customer loyalty among leading credit card brands for 16 years in a row by Brand Keys, among the best in identity fraud resolution in Javelin Strategy & Research’s Eighth Annual Card Issuer’s Safety Scorecard Report, and winner of the 2012 Call Center Excellence Award by IQPC.
The Discover brand is also strong in our communities. In 2012, employees volunteered 40,000 hours and Discover donated millions of dollars to nearly 1,500 non-profit organizations, including $3 million in grants to schools as part of Pathway to Financial Success, Discover’s five-year commitment to bring financial education into America’s public high
schools. For more information, see the Corporate Responsibility section of www.discoverfinancial.com.
Discover is backed by a dedicated
and diverse group of employees, and
by many others who have contributed to the strength of our brand—including our loyal customers, our business partners,
our shareholders, and our talented Board of Directors. Thank you all for helping to make Discover one of the strongest and most reputable brands in financial services. Together, we will continue to build on our brand as we focus on being the leading direct bank and payments partner.
