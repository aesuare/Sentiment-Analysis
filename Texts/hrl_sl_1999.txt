As we approach the end of the millennium, I'm pleased to report Hormel Foods recorded its strongest year ever in volume and financial performance. All core operating units contributed to these superior results. For the fiscal year ended October 30, reported net earnings rose 17.3 percent to $163,438,000, a gain of $24,147,000, from earnings of $139,291,000 attained one year earlier. Reported earnings per share were $2.22, an increase of $.37 over last year's figure of $1.85. Fiscal 1999 earnings included a gain of $3,808,000, or $.05 a share, for the sale of land by Campofrio Alimentacion, S.A., Madrid, Spain, a company in which Hormel Foods has a 21.4 percent ownership interest. Excluding this one-time gain, operating earnings for the year were $159,630,000, or $2.17 a share. Fiscal 1998 earnings, on the other hand, included a gain of $17,402,000, or $.23 a share, for the sale of the company's gelatin/specialized proteins plant in Davenport, Iowa. Excluding this gain, operating results for fiscal 1998 were $121,889,000, or $1.62 per share. Thus, Hormel Foods operating results improved 31.0 percent in fiscal 1999, or $.55 per share over fiscal 1998.

Let me review briefly our individual business groups. The Meat Products Group registered exceptional gains in dollar sales, gross margin and total profits. In addition to the Always Tender line of flavored pork, fresh pork and Consumer Ready fresh pork, Hormel microwave bacon and Hormel fully cooked bacon exceeded goals and have recently been expanded from regional to national distribution. Retail hams, led by the company's signature Cure 81 ham brand, had double-digit volume gains. Industry category leader Hormel pepperoni, benefiting from a national media campaign and successful consumer promotions, achieved a sixth consecutive year of increased volume. Within the Prepared Foods Group, sales of Hormel chili and Stagg chili grew more than three times the pace of the total category while other established brands such as SPAM luncheon meat, Dinty Moore stew, Mary Kitchen hash, Kid's Kitchen shelf-stable entrees and Hormel chunk meats also achieved strong volume gains. The launch in southern California by Herdez Corporation, our 50 percent owned joint venture, of the El Torito line of restaurantauthentic Mexican foods has surpassed early expectations. Within

To Our Shareholders,
Sources of Growth Worldwide dollar sales increased 3.0 percent to

$3,357,757,000 from $3,261,045,000, despite the fact fiscal 1999 was a 52-week year compared to last year's 53 weeks. Tonnage growth for the year was 7.1 percent on top of last year's strong 10.3 percent increase. Domestically and internationally, the gain reflects increases in virtually every major category in which we compete, attesting to the success of company marketing initiatives and consumer acceptance of both new and established product lines. Hormel Foods has aggressively supported its lines of value-added branded meats and food products. Our company has some of the strongest and most recognizable brands in the industry with SPAM luncheon meat, Cure 81 ham, Hormel chili, Hormel pepperoni, Dinty Moore stew, Black Label bacon and many others. These branded products enhance the company's reputation for quality and reliability. They provide a foundation for the introduction of new, contemporary products to satisfy demands for increasing variety, convenience and range of tastes. With Always Tender flavored pork, Hormel fully cooked bacon, Bread Ready presliced meats, El Torito Mexican sauces and foods and Jennie-O turkey breast tenderloins, turkey grillers, turkey burgers and boneless and bone-in rotisserie turkey products, we continue to extend our trademarks to include products that move us further from unbranded commodities.

our Mexican, Asian, Indian and Mediterranean lines, we have added new ethnic foods in response to strong consumer trends toward greater variety in home-cooked meals. By focusing on adding value for foodservice operators, the company's Foodservice Group was able to advance further its industry leadership. The Foodservice Group recorded double-digit tonnage growth and excellent financial results. Bread Ready ham, poultry, beef and sausage enjoyed strong volume gains as foodservice operators looked to reduce labor in sandwich preparation and ensure accurate portion control. Sales of cooked beef and portion-controlled fresh pork benefited from foodservice operators' efforts to balance costs and customer expectations. Jennie-O marked its 50th anniversary year by becoming the world's largest turkey processor. Turkey industry pricing improved throughout the year and margins benefited from low feed grain prices. Jennie-O has an exciting product development program that focuses on a mix of new value-added, higher margin items. Special concentration was given to the deli with the introduction or expanded distribution of three rotisserie products, a presliced three-pound package of turkey deli breasts for in-house sandwich preparation and a Jennie-O VIP turkey roast for center-of-the-plate entrees.

Double-digit export volume for Hormel Foods International (HFI) reflects improvement in all major product categories and in all regions of the world. Processed meats and fresh pork and turkey were important contributors to the gain as were SPAM luncheon meat and Stagg chili. A new alliance formed early in the first quarter, called the Purefoods-Hormel Company, gives HFI a strong partner in the Philippines with whom to market a variety of canned foods and refrigerated meat products.
Supporting our Businesses The company's many product initiatives

new products, manufacturing processes, productivity gains and packaging technology.
Capital Investment In recent years, most of our capital spending has been for plant renewal, cost reduction, increased productivity, quality improvement and employee safety and ergonomic needs. In fiscal 1999, $79,121,000 was expended to bring the total for the past five years to $491,399,000, confirming the company's ongoing commitment to modernization of its facilities. Hormel Foods is determined to be prepared for future market opportunities. In a move to meet the excellent consumer response to Always Tender fresh and flavored pork products and Always Tender Consumer Ready fresh pork, capacities were expanded in Austin, Minn., Fremont, Neb., Rochelle, Ill., and Osceola, Iowa. The popularity of the company's microwave-ready and fully cooked bacon products required capital expenditures in excess of $10 million. A new customized slicing line in Austin raised production of Black Label microwave-ready bacon by more than 50 percent. In Atlanta, Ga., the addition of a four-lane bacon transfer system resulted in

received record support levels. Marketing expense, which includes media, advertising and promotions, reached $307,376,000 in 1999, 11.0 percent greater than the year before. These expenditures are evidence of Hormel Foods commitment to establish new products and contemporize existing brands. Research and development is also a vital ingredient in ensuring continued growth. Spending in this area has grown from $7.8 million in 1995 to a record $9.6 million in 1999. This R&D investment has led to improved products and facilities and the development of

higher capacity levels for Black Label fully cooked bacon. Reopening a 93,000 square foot meat products plant in Houston, Texas, will help fulfill demand for fully cooked bacon and Cure 81 bone-in spiral-sliced ham. Late in the first quarter, the conversion to a two-piece lithographed SPAM luncheon meat can was completed at the Austin plant. A similar conversion had been completed in 1998 at the Fremont facility. The changeover provides improved packaging graphics and important cost savings. Also in the year, the company aggressively pursued initiatives to further automate its pork slaughtering operations. More than $5 million was spent to add an automatic loin-pulling system in Austin and install specially designed robots to perform heavy manual labor functions. These advances are expected to enhance quality, increase yields, improve working conditions and reduce costs. At Jennie-O, a 33,000 square foot expansion of the Pelican Rapids, Minn., plant is scheduled for completion in the summer of 2000. New technologically advanced processing equipment will add 40 million pounds to this plant's yearly output. In September, Jennie-O purchased a 23,000 square foot facility in Golden Valley, Minn. This facility processes boneless turkey thigh meat which is shipped to other Jennie-O plants for further processing into branded products.
Measuring Our Business There are a number of ways to evaluate the

and incentive tools necessary to optimize the performance of our various business functions and thereby create additional shareholder value. As witnessed by the results reported in this Annual Report, Hormel Foods is performing well. We do believe, however, implementation of EVA will support our drive for even better performance and increased shareholder value in the future. The adoption of EVA led to a reorganization of the company's major operations into units better able to streamline accountability and increase overall organizational effectiveness. The restructuring led to a number of significant promotions addressed later in this letter.
Cash Dividends and Share Repurchase In September 1998, the company announced a plan to repurchase up to five million shares of common stock. Given the company's continuing surplus cash position and strong balance sheet, the Board of Directors determined a share repurchase program delivers added value to shareholders by improving return on equity while demonstrating management's confidence in the future performance of the company. Under this program 2,248,100 shares of common stock were purchased on the open market in 1999 at an average price of $39 per share. For the 33rd consecutive year, the company's annual cash dividend rate on the common stock of the corporation was raised. The new increase amounted to a 3.1 percent improvement which increased the annual payment from $.64 to $.66 per share. This consistency of performance is shared by fewer than 100 of the more than 15,000 publicly held U.S. companies. Also of significance is the fact that Hormel Foods has never missed a dividend payment to stockholders since becoming a public company in 1928. Senior Management Changes I would like to recognize the career

progress of a company, including growth in profits, return on capital and return on equity. A method receiving increasing attention in recent years is economic value added (EVA) which measures success as the difference between net operating profit after tax and the cost of capital used to generate that profit. Late in the 1999 fiscal year, Hormel Foods announced the adoption of EVA as the basis on which it would make capital allocation decisions. The system was implemented October 31, the beginning of fiscal year 2000. We believe EVA will provide the measurement

He was a member of the company's Executive Committee and Board of Directors. Jim, another long-term veteran with 36 years of service, will conclude his company tenure early next year. Prior to moving to Jennie-O in his current capacity, Jim held executive positions within Hormel Foods as vice president of strategic planning and development, vice president of manufacturing and vice president of engineering, respectively. Both Stan and Jim made significant contributions to the company's success and their leadership and commitment will be missed. I mentioned earlier that implementation of EVA led to a number of changes within our top management team. We have, for a long time, been committed to superior training and personnel development programs. This has proven valuable in providing a flow of capable candidates for the many opportunities which are occurring. Within the newly formed Refrigerated Foods Group, Gary J. Ray was given overall responsibility for fresh pork, processed meats and foodservice sales and marketing functions. Ronald W. Fielding was elected group vice president of meat products. He was named a company vice president nearly three years ago and had served as president of our Hormel Foods International (HFI) subsidiary since January 1996. Ron was replaced as president of HFI by Richard A. Bross who previously served as a vice president within the company's Grocery Products Division. Also within the Refrigerated Foods Group, William F. Snyder was named vice president of operations, Kurt F. Mueller, vice president of sales and marketing for fresh pork, and Joe C. Swedberg, vice president of marketing for processed meats. In the Prepared Foods Group, Eric A. Brown's responsibilities were expanded to full profit and loss responsibility, including manufacturing operations. Gary C. Paxton, vice president, assumed direct production responsibility for prepared foods. Larry L. Vorpahl was named vice president of grocery products marketing and Douglas R. Reetz, vice president of grocery products sales. James A. Jorgenson was advanced from vice president of human resources to senior vice president of corporate staff. While continuing

to have responsibility for all personnel and human resource functions, Jim now has reporting to him all purchasing, logistics, customer service, industrial engineering, company air and fleet transportation services and engineering operations. Larry J. Pfeil was promoted from director to vice president of engineering. Mahlon C. Schneider, vice president and general counsel for the company, was elected a senior vice president in charge of external affairs. He continues to serve as general counsel and assumed additional supervisory duties for marketing services and public relations. V. Allan Krejci advanced from director to vice president of public relations within the newly formed external affairs business group. Jeffrey M. Ettinger, named treasurer in early 1998, was elected a company vice president and will become president and chief executive officer of Jennie-O following Jim Reith's retirement early in fiscal year 2000. James N. Sheehan, president of Hormel Financial Services Corp., was elected treasurer of Hormel Foods. In the first quarter of fiscal 1999, Fred D. Halvin advanced to assistant controller. Fred joined Hormel Foods in 1985 and most recently served as manager of state and local taxes. With the depth and quality of our management and employees, we are enthusiastic about the year 2000 and the continuing opportunities ahead. Proud of our past, we approach the future with enthusiasm. Our objective is to remain an industry leader. Our purpose is to improve performance. Our goal is to increase shareholder value.
