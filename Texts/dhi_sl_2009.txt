Dear Fellow Shareholders:
Fiscal 2009 was another challenging year for our company, as the difficult housing market continued and overall economic conditions worsened. The current downturn in the U.S. homebuilding industry is in its fourth year, and it has become one of the most severe housing recessions in U.S. history, with unprecedented price declines, historically low new home sales volumes and high levels of home foreclosures. Throughout fiscal 2009, the financial sector remained under pressure, the commercial real estate market weakened, and real estate lending was extremely restrictive. The broader economy remained in a long, harsh recession, marked by increasing unemployment, weak consumer confidence and severe volatility in the stock and bond markets. Unemployment, which is the most important economic indicator for housing demand, continued to rise and exceeded 10% for the first time since 1983. As a result, the housing market continues to experience increasing home foreclosures, high inventories of existing homes for sale, intense price competition and reduced mortgage financing availability.
While the challenges for our company and our industry continue, we have seen some indications that we are at or very near the bottom of this cycle. Due to fewer new home starts, the months’ supply of new home inventory is at its lowest level in three years, and the number of homes available for sale is at a 38-year low. Our fourth quarter net home sales increased 26% on a year-over-year basis, our first quarterly sales increase since the March quarter of 2006. Our sales cancellation rate, while still above normal historical levels, dropped below 30% for the first time in three years and showed stability in the mid-20% range for the last two quarters. Our sales backlog increased 6% in the number of homes under contract compared to the prior year. Our inventory of homes, which we adjust based on current sales demand and our expectations for future demand, decreased by 6% in fiscal 2009. We are now identifying and purchasing new residential lots on flexible, low-risk option terms at prices that we expect to generate higher gross margins than our current company average. Although the timing of some of the recent demand from first-time homebuyers has been driven by the federal homebuyer tax credit, we believe that these positive factors are signs of potential market stabilization.
We continue to balance these early signs of stability with the ongoing challenges in our industry by approaching our markets and our business with realism. We have strengthened our financial position by reducing inventory and generating cash for 13 consecutive quarters, which we have used to repay debt and increase our cash balance. In May, we issued $500 million of 2% convertible senior notes to provide additional capital for our business. Throughout the company, our employees have worked extremely hard to drive sales and cut operating costs. These efforts yielded the following results in fiscal 2009:
• $1.1 billion of positive cash flows generated from operations;
• A $1.9 billion homebuilding cash balance at September 30, 2009;
• Over $470 million of consolidated debt reductions;
• $270 million of homebuilding SG&A expense reductions;
• A 10% decrease in our owned lot position; and
• A year-end net homebuilding debt to total capital ratio of 36.3%, a 730 basis point improvement from a year ago.
These achievements have positioned us well for 2010 and beyond. We expect difficult housing conditions to persist throughout fiscal 2010, as broader economic pressures will create further challenges for the homebuilding industry. However, we believe that opportunities exist for well-capitalized builders to capture market share from builders who are struggling to survive this extended downturn. Consequently, we will remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position, while pursuing selected opportunities by:
• Offering high quality, affordable homes targeting first-time homebuyers;
• Controlling our inventory of owned lots and homes relative to sales demand;

• Identifying and controlling additional finished lots through option purchase contracts; • Limiting our capital outlays for raw land purchases and development costs;
• Controlling our costs of construction;
• Improving our gross margins from current levels;
• Reducing our SG&A costs as a percentage of homebuilding revenue; • Maintaining a strong cash balance; and
• Reducing our outstanding debt.
We expect that these actions will maintain our strong liquidity position and balance sheet and will position us for profitability in fiscal 2010 and beyond. We also expect these actions to provide us with flexibility to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities, even if the overall housing market volume remains flat with current levels. Our ongoing goal is to continue to be a leader in the homebuilding industry in terms of operating profitability and balance sheet strength.
We believe that we have passed two major milestones in this homebuilding downturn. We believe that our impairment charges and our net loss peaked in fiscal 2008, and that our number of home closings hit their lowest point in fiscal 2009. Our top goal in fiscal 2010 is to return to profitability, and each employee throughout our company is working to achieve this goal and to position the company for sustainable profitability in the years to come.
We appreciate and thank our employees, suppliers and subcontractors for their efforts this year, which allowed our company to make tremendous progress while navigating through these difficult times. We also thank all D.R. Horton shareholders for your support and belief in the future of our company. Despite the current uncertain economic climate, we believe that our business and our stock valuation have upside potential. Our belief is based on our strong competitive advantages, including our long experience with first- time homebuyers, geographic diversity, low overhead cost structure, economies of scale, liquidity position and balance sheet strength. We will leverage these strengths as we meet the ongoing challenges in the marketplace, and we will return to profitability.
