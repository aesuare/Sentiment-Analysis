A Message from the Chairman
  I am pleased to report that in 2015 we made excellent progress on our objectives for growing our business – with our dedicated employees again contributing in countless ways to our efforts.
In 2015, we increased earnings for the third consecutive year despite a difficult energy market. We completed 2015 with operating earnings of $2.91 per share, compared to $2.76 per share in the prior year.
Our strong financial condition has allowed us to steadily increase our dividend. In February 2016, we raised
our indicative annual dividend rate to $1.64 per share from $1.56 per share. This was the 12th increase in
our dividend in the last 13 years. PSEG has one of the longest records in corporate America for paying dividends, extending over 109 consecutive years. We remain well positioned to finance our capital program without the need to issue equity while still having the opportunity for consistent and sustainable growth in our dividend.
Our strategy – based on the three pillars of operational excellence, financial strength and disciplined investment – has served our customers and shareholders well for many years. We are determined to keep a relentless focus on these essentials of our business.
Operational Excellence
Reliability is fundamental to excellence in our industry. In 2015, PSE&G was named the Mid-Atlantic region’s most reliable electric utility for the 14th consecutive year by an industry-benchmarking group. PSE&G was also recognized with an outstanding outage response award for restoring customers 30 percent faster than any other large investor-owned utility.

In addition to enjoying the benefits of reliability, PSE&G’s residential customers reaped substantial savings from low-cost gas supplies and the effective management of our natural gas storage and transportation contracts. Since 2009, PSE&G has been able to reduce residential gas heating bills by 55 percent, for $916 in annual savings for the typical customer.
We are reaching out to our customers in new ways. PSEG has more than 90,000 Twitter followers and a considerable Facebook presence as well. Whether using new or traditional channels, we strive to become even more responsive to our customers’ needs. PSEG Long Island has a similar focus and in its second year continued to make significant improvements to its processes, operations and storm response – yielding a 52-point increase and a 70-point increase, respectively, in residential and business customer satisfaction compared to a year ago according to J.D. Power.
Reliability at PSEG is also about having power plants that are available to run as needed. PSEG Power, our
large wholesale generation business, has a diverse, low-cost portfolio of generation assets located near load centers in attractive markets in the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Our diverse fuel mix and dispatch flexibility support our ability to respond to various market conditions around the clock and throughout the year.
During 2015, we improved the performance of both our nuclear and fossil operations, with continued upgrades in efficiency and output. Our combined-cycle fleet increased year-over-year electricity output by
11 percent, with our Linden 1 and 2 and Bethlehem Energy Center units achieving record performance. Our nuclear fleet remains critical to our success and a major provider of reliable, carbon-free energy for New Jersey and the wider region. In 2015, our total nuclear fleet achieved an average capacity factor of 90 percent. We have added to our existing nuclear capacity through various plant improvements in recent years, and this past year completed a power uprate at the Peach Bottom nuclear facility, which we jointly own with Exelon.

Financial Strength
Financial strength is a key differentiator in our business. We have been proactive in taking a broad range of measures to maintain and further enhance our strong financial position.
We have transformed our business mix toward one with a growing component of more stable, regulated earnings. PSE&G has grown to represent more
than half of our operating earnings, while our power generation business continues to provide strong cash flow. We have repeatedly found ways to get more out of our assets and reduce costs without compromising safety or reliability. Our financial strength enables
us to pursue our growth program without needing
to issue equity. We have expanded investments to meet customer requirements, while at the same time increasing our dividend. Our strong balance sheet anchors all of our efforts. We are determined to maintain a solid financial profile capable of meeting our growth objectives and continuing our track record of returning cash to shareholders.
Disciplined Investment
Our robust five-year capital investment program
has increased to approximately $16 billion, with our regulated utility investments representing more than 70 percent of our planned capital expenditures. Transmission investment is the largest single part of this effort. In the last two years we have completed four major transmission projects that have improved the flow of power across New Jersey and made an important contribution to system reliability. In effect, we are re-wiring New Jersey to support reliability long into the future, and as we do so, we are also creating thousands of jobs.
We continue to invest on many fronts to support safe, reliable service. In 2015, we obtained approval to invest $905 million over a three-year period in our Gas System Modernization program, which would enable us to start accelerated replacement of our aging system of cast iron gas pipes. In addition to enhancing safety and reliability, this initiative will create 500 jobs and boost New Jersey’s economy – and our timing couldn’t be better with natural gas prices at their lowest levels in decades. Meanwhile, we completed many projects
and moved ahead with others as part of our three-year
$1.2 billion Energy Strong program, which is designed to harden and improve the resiliency of our electric and gas systems against extreme storms.
We are promoting sustainability through our focus on clean energy solutions. Since 2009, PSE&G has invested more than $800 million to directly develop or help finance 200 megawatts of clean solar power.

PSE&G recently completed its 28th grid-connected community solar facility and the eighth built on a landfill or brownfield site, feeding green energy to all of our customers across New Jersey.
Meanwhile, we have continued to successfully grow PSEG Solar Source’s portfolio of solar projects
across the country. In 2015, we completed projects in California and Maryland and recently acquired projects to be built in Utah, Colorado and North Carolina. All
of these projects are under long-term contracts with creditworthy customers. PSEG Solar Source’s portfolio now comprises 277 megawatts, with 16 utility-
scale projects in 12 states. We continue to explore opportunities to expand and optimize our solar fleet.
Energy efficiency is a key to a sustainable future. In 2015, we received approval to invest an additional $95 million in programs that will extend PSE&G’s existing energy efficiency offerings. Our ultimate goal is to help all of our customers achieve the benefits of energy efficiency.

PSEG PLANS TO INVEST MORE THAN
16
PSEG’s success for more than 100 years has been based on putting our energy to work in many ways
that benefit our customers, our shareholders and the larger society around us. In 2015, PSEG was named
for the eighth consecutive year to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, which recognizes leading companies for their commitment to economic, environmental and social responsibility. Our focus on sustainability is reflected in a $250,000 grant by the PSEG Foundation to the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey, helping fund the construction of a net-zero, solar powered home built by students and entered into the U.S. Department of Energy’s Solar Decathlon competition.
In addition to all they do in their jobs, our employees have a long and proud Public Service tradition of volunteering on behalf of many worthy causes. I would like to thank them for all of their continued support and fine work.
We remain as dedicated as ever to long-term leadership in providing safe, reliable, economic and greener energy. We thank you, our shareholders, for your loyalty and support. We will continue working hard to maintain your confidence and trust.
Sincerely,
Ralph Izzo
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Public Service Enterprise Group

$ BILLION
OVER FIVE YEaRS
We are actively investing to enhance the competitiveness of our environmentally well-positioned generation business. In addition to ongoing plant improvements, we are significantly increasing our investment in new, clean and efficient gas-fired capacity. Within the past seven months we announced plans
to construct and operate three new combined-cycle gas plants: a 755-megawatt facility at the Keys Energy Center in Maryland; a 540-megawatt facility on our existing Sewaren station site in New Jersey; and a 485-megawatt facility on our existing Bridgeport Harbor station site, in Bridgeport, Connecticut. The new Keys and Sewaren facilities are expected to be operational
in 2018 and the new Bridgeport Harbor plant in 2019. Together, these three plants represent an investment of approximately $2 billion.
In summary, we have many opportunities in front of
us to extend the growth associated with our existing capital program. We continue to benefit from having
two complementary businesses. In PSE&G we have a leading utility that has sustained a strong growth course, expanding its investments in projects that provide reasonable, risk-adjusted returns in ways that meet customer needs and advance the state of New Jersey’s policy goals. And, in PSEG Power we have a regionally competitive generation business with a strong focus
on getting the most value from its diverse, low-cost
and environmentally advantaged asset base. We have performed well over many years and believe we are well positioned for the future.
