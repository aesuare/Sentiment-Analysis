   We made significant headway in our business this past year, emerging stronger than we were before the downturn that began nearly two years ago. Throughout, we’ve tried to keep a steady focus on our customers. We follow, first and foremost, a customer strategy at Nordstrom — not a price, brand, technology or any other corporate strategy. We believe it is this singular focus on our customers that has kept us disciplined, guided careful decision making and enabled us to take advantage of opportunities.
Let’s briefly recap some of our 2009 results:
• Net earnings of $441 million, a 9.9% increase from the prior year.
• Total retail sales decrease of 0.2% to $8.26 billion, and same-store sales decline of 4.2% for the year.
• Higher gross profit driven by more regular price selling.
• Free cash flow of $579 million.
• Inventory turn of 5.4, a historically high rate for our business.
Our performance last year exceeded our expectations and put us in a better position both financially and competitively. We achieved our results by seeing the business through the eyes of our customers. This led us to enhanced service, merchandise that is more current and compelling, improvements to our multi- channel capabilities and continued discipline in the way we manage our business.
A COMPELLING OFFERING
One of the ways we created closer alignment with customers was through our merchandise mix. In a historically challenging year, our buyers had much at stake and the strength of our vendor relationships mattered more than ever. We planned cautiously so that we could maximize our merchandise flexibility and evolve with our customers. With inventory, we were careful to stay in line with sales trends while bringing in merchandise that resonated with our customers.
Even in tough times, we wanted to be able to deliver on our customers’ expectations. We found ways to continue leveraging our broad, diverse merchandise offering that reflected our customers’ desire for value, quality and newness. We moved quickly to provide new merchandise as customers started to respond. Our merchandise is now as current as it’s ever been, and there is a steady flow of new fashion into our stores.
MULTI-CHANNEL PROGRESS
We know more of our customers are choosing to shop with us in different ways. Customers don’t see a distinction between a Nordstrom store, nordstrom.com or our catalogs. To them, it’s just Nordstrom, and they want a consistently great shopping experience no matter where or how they choose to shop.
In fall of 2009, we took a big step forward in serving customers across multiple channels by creating shared inventory between our full-line stores and nordstrom.com. Now, online customers can access merchandise no matter where it is located. If we are out of stock of an item at our fulfillment center, our systems instantly locate whether it is at any of our full-line stores and we can fulfill the online order at the store level.
As a result, customers are able to find what they are looking for more often from us online. Shopping across channels is more convenient. From a business standpoint, this capability greatly improved efficiency, enabling us to turn inventory faster and bring in newer merchandise.
We view these and other multi-channel improvements as simply another means to create a seamless shopping experience for customers. Ultimately, our goal is to enable the customer to shop with us on their terms — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

DISCIPLINED EXECUTION
Our commitment to customers has also guided careful expense management. The dramatic drop in 2008 prompted us to take a hard look at our business. We questioned aspects of our operations that did not enhance the shopping experience. We wanted to protect the things that help us take care of customers while scaling back other costs. This meant becoming leaner primarily at the back of the house — areas of the business that did not engage with customers. This editing and prioritizing based on the customer has enabled us to manage our business more effectively and profitably.
We also invested in our future by growing our store presence in top markets and retail locations across the country. We opened three Nordstrom stores, relocated another and opened 13 Nordstrom Racks.
THE ROAD AHEAD
Although the economy remains uncertain and there is lingering caution with customers, we are making solid progress. We are better able to serve our customers in a manner they would like. We achieved earnings growth and strengthened our financial position. While it is premature to say things have turned around, we feel encouraged by some key factors:
• Building sales momentum in 2009, including consecutive same-store sales increases each of the last four months of the year.
• Fresh, compelling merchandise that customers are telling us they want.
• Tight inventory management and the flexibility to quickly respond to trends across all stores.
• More ways to connect with customers on a multi-channel basis, including plans for an enhanced online experience, improved mobile shopping capabilities and better engagement with customers through social networking.
• Continuing store growth, with announced plans for three new Nordstrom stores, one store relocation and 17 Nordstrom Rack openings in 2010.
We’ve learned a great deal during this difficult stretch and the experience has made us better. Looking ahead, we believe we can earn more business. At the same time, we remain grounded in our customer strategy and mindful of what we’ve been through. Improving service is at the core of our business and something we have to work hard at each and every day.
