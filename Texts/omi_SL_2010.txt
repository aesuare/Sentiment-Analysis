Looking back, we see that 2010 was a tough year for the healthcare industry. Lower- than-normal utilization of healthcare services affected healthcare companies across the board, including Owens & M400inor. However, we ended 4t0h0 e year on a positive note by achieving our earnings goal for the year, signing significant new customers, terminating our previously fro- zenpensionplan,advancingourstrategicinitiatives,andgeneratingstrongoperatingcashflow.

Despite the challenges in 2010, I am pleased to report that we consistently adhered to our

increasingly seeking to leverage our logistics expertise, our reputation in healthcare, and our extensive distribution channel. Consequently, our various logistics services are gaining traction with manufacturers and suppliers.
While the impact of healthcare reform remains uncertain, the healthcare provider market is moving ahead, and the response in many cases is consolidation. Hospitals are consolidating to form larger IHNs. These IHNs are acquiring facilities and building or purchasing outpatient surgery centers and physician practices. Consequently, today’s healthcare provider must juggle multiple supply chains. Our goal is to bring as much of that supply chain under our umbrella as possible. Our best-in-class supply-chain solutions are designed to alleviate the daily pressure on the IHN customer from multiple suppliers, scores of daily deliveries, and thousands of disparate invoices. As we prepare for the future, we continue to believe that our long-standing legacy in healthcare, unique culture, highly developed supply-chain expertise, and reputation for innovation will ensure that Owens & Minor continues to play a vital role in the healthcare market.
Looking at our financial results for 2010, we see clear evidence that it was an unusual year in our market.As a result of lackluster utilization of healthcare services, driven by high unemployment and cautious consumer behavior, our net revenues grew only 1.1% for the year to more than $8.1 billion. However, a combination of expense management and lower comparative incentive expenses led to lower SG&A as a percentage of revenues. Operating earnings for the year, once adjusted for the pension plan settlement charge, were nearly $216 million, or 2.65% of net revenues, representing an improvement of approximately $15 million when compared to 2009. For the year, adjusted net income per diluted com- mon share was $1.94, within the earnings goals we established for 2010. In light of the low growth profile of our market all year, we were pleased that we achieved our earnings goal for the year, ending 2010 on a positive note. These accomplishments were all the more impressive in light of the investments we made in our infrastructure, strategic initiatives, and preparations for onboarding new customers.
Asset management remains a hallmark of Owens & Minor. Our “days sales outstanding” as of the end of the year reached an all-time low at 19.6 days, and we ended the year with very strong operating cash flow.These achievements resulted directly from the collective efforts of our teammates, including those who manage our credit, our cash, and our customer relationships to achieve consistently enviable results.

The leadership of our board of directors is a critical factor in our success, and I would like to recognize two board members who will retire in 2011, after many years of dedicated service to O2w0e0n6s &20M07in2o0r0.W8 e20sa0y9fa2r0e1w0ell and thank you to John Crotty and James Ukrop.
Our strong track record on asset management gives us the flexibility to deploy capital on a number of fronts. One avenue for capital deployment is investment in our business to

a platform to return value to our shareholders through our dividend policy. Over ten years,
our cumulative total return is approximately 200%, an impressive result when compared to the S&P 500 Index, which had a cumulative total return of 15.1% over the same period. Accordingly, our board of directors approved a 13% increase in our first quarter 2011 divi- dend, as well as a $50 million share repurchase program over three years, which is designed to offset dilution from share-based incentives for our team.

 At the same time, we welcome two new board member nominees: John Gerdelman and Lemuel Lewis.These gentlemen bring diverse skills to the table, but share a commitment to the continued growth and success of Owens & Minor, as we build on our legacy.
Our legacy results from many decades of consistently providing exceptional customer service and operational excellence.We constantly measure our performance to ensure that we are delivering a quality service to the market.Accordingly,we survey our customers each year to ensure that we are meeting their expectations. For 2010, 99% said they were either “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with our service, representing an improvement compared to the year before.We view this as a strong validation of the care we take with every order, every delivery, and every customer.We also attracted notice for our outstanding operational abilities, as we were ranked No. 1 on Gartner’s “Healthcare Supply Chain Top 25 Leaders” for 2010. For a company with a 129-year legacy in healthcare, that is no small accomplishment. We were also named to Fortune magazine’s “Most Admired Companies” list in 2010, rank- ing No. 2 in our industry sector. Does this sort of acclaim matter? We believe it does.These honors demonstrate that we serve our customers with excellence every single day. But, we are not satisfied.We know that excellence demands daily attention, and we are unwavering on that score.
The awards and recognition we receive result directly from the dedication of our teammates nationwide. We remain committed to fielding the best-trained workforce in healthcare and to developing the future leaders of our company. Through Owens & Minor University® (OMU®), we continually invest in improving their job skills and providing educational opportunities so that our teammates are well-prepared for the future. OMU is also making an impact in the healthcare industry. In 2010, OMU delivered courses to more than 350 students from hospitals, industry partners and universities.
Another important part of our culture is, and always has been, supporting the communi- ties we serve. Accordingly, our teammates, friends and families donated thousands of hours to volunteer projects during 2010.These projects ranged from fundraising for the United Way to volunteering for the Special Olympics. In 2010, we held the most successful of our Healthcare Supplier Diversity Symposiums to date, bringing together approximately 300 minority-, women- and veteran-owned businesses. Just as we are committed to fostering diversity in the supply chain, we also care about our environment and continue to launch green initiatives. For example, our fleet was certified by the EPA’s SmartWaySM Transport Partnership, and we have installed energy-saving battery chargers and energy-efficient fluorescent lighting in our distribution centers.
“Every day and every year, we depend on our teammates to serve our customers, manage our assets, meet our goals, and serve our communi- ties. They are the reason for our success.”
