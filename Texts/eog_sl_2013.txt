WELL PLAYED
2013 was EOG’s best year yet. Innovative completion technology developed by EOG employees generated impressive gains in well productivity, particularly in our premium crude oil shale resource assets, the South Texas Eagle Ford and North Dakota Bakken.
These gains positioned EOG as a forerunner in U.S. horizontal crude oil growth. For the first time, EOG ranked as the largest crude oil producer in Texas in March and, by September, had become the largest crude
oil producer in the onshore U.S. Lower 48, according to IHS, which gathers industry production data.
EOG continues to benefit from its first mover advantage in capturing the most valuable acreage in the country’s two
best U.S. onshore crude oil plays – the South Texas Eagle Ford and the North Dakota Bakken. These substantial resources combined with attractive holdings in the Texas/New Mexico Delaware Basin Leonard oil play provide a high rate-of-return drilling inventory to drive strong growth for many years to come.
EOG’s largest single crude oil growth vehicle continues to be the South Texas Eagle Ford. During 2013, we replicated the same excellent results on capital return and growth potential in the west that we had achieved with EOG’s prolific eastern acreage. This success, coupled with downspacing and improved well productivity across the field, increased EOG’s South Texas Eagle Ford estimated potential net reserves(1) by 1.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BnBoe), from 2.2 to 3.2 BnBoe. Since discovering the play in 2010, we have more than doubled EOG’s
potential number of drilling locations and, through a combination of more locations and better individual well results, increased
the total potential reserve estimate(1)
more than 3.5 times. And we still have ample running room.
EOG’s performance last year in the
North Dakota Bakken/Three Forks is best characterized as a technical renaissance.
Our Bakken Core and Antelope
Extension drilling program was revitalized because of EOG’s ability to create
and apply leading-edge technology.
A dramatic increase in average initial production rates and overall well
productivity turned EOG’s Bakken
position into another high rate-of-return growth asset. As part of this regeneration, we increased the drilling inventory and are testing concepts that could extend it further.

    In 2013, EOG also made notable progress
in our strong Delaware Basin Leonard and ($) Wolfcamp plays. We improved the rate of

However, what distinguishes EOG most is our people. Our workforce of more than 2,800 employees is committed to responsible and safe exploration and production practices,
as well as compliance with our health, safety and environmental procedures. This proactive mindset is equally important to both our company and the communities where we operate.
Our technically talented players collaborate in multi-disciplined, decentralized teams in their respective areas of operation. Because they are never satisfied with the status quo, EOG employees constantly test, modify and implement new concepts that continue to result in better wells and lower costs. When

WELL DONE
On December 31, 2013, EOG’s long-time Chairman Mark Papa retired. Under his impeccable leadership, EOG grew and prospered. We thank Mark for his vision, integrity and courage. We all are very pleased that he will continue to serve on EOG’s Board of Directors.
Having been a member of EOG’s management team for many years, I am honored to pick up where Mark left off as the leader of this exceptional company. Looking at our operations, we are focused on increasing 2014 activity levels and accumulating an even more powerful crude oil-based portfolio. With such a deep domestic crude oil drilling inventory, we have never had more opportunities to grow EOG’s
NORTH DAKOTA BAKKEN
resource base to keep us ahead in the game. Exercising capital discipline, we plan to drill better wells, increase the number of drilling locations, boost recovery factors in our top assets and seek promising new plays.
Working together, EOG’s team is well equipped to seize these opportunities. Therefore, 2014 should be another excellent year.
