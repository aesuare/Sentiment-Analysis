our 2013 operating performance marked the fourth straight year of strong increases in comparable RevPaR, with growth of 5.8% on a constant dollar basis. our results were driven first by strong demand which allowed us to drive rate in both our group and transient segments, and, second and equally impor- tant, by excellent cost controls which led to another year of strong margin improvement. some of the highlights for the last twelve months include:
3 adjusted Funds from operations increased 19% to $1.31 per diluted share, while adjusted eBItda grew almost 10% to $1.306 billion. net income for the year was $325 million, while diluted earnings per common share was $0.42;
3 We acquired two exceptionally well-located hotels in target markets: the Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach in may for $139 mil- lion and then, in the first quarter of 2014, the Powell street Hotel in san Francisco for $75 million, including the fee simple interest in both properties. the Powell street Hotel

  includes over 8,500 square feet of retail space that is subject to a long-term retail lease with sephora, a leading provider of perfume and cosmetics. We also expanded our presence in europe, acquiring the sheraton stockholm Hotel in sweden through our joint venture;
3 We further refined the allocation of our portfolio by disposing of seven properties in 2013 and early 2014 for a total sales price of $960 million, including the sale of an 89% interest in the Philadelphia marriott downtown in january 2014. these sales included the disposition of properties that are located in non-target markets, or where we were otherwise able to opportunistically take advantage of attractive pricing;
3 We invested $133 million in redevelopment and return on investment capital projects that were designed to increase profitability of our properties. these projects included the redevelopment of the pool area, including new waterslides, activity areas and dining facilities at the orlando World Center marriott and the completion of a new 20,000 square foot ballroom at the newark airport marriott in time for the 2014 super Bowl at the nearby metlife stadium;
3 We successfully negotiated a 40-year extension of the ground lease for the Houston airport marriott. We also com- pleted negotiations of management agreements that resulted in enhancing or obtaining franchise rights on five hotels, including the recent conversion of the memphis marriott downtown to the sheraton memphis downtown;
3 We celebrated the opening of the Hyatt Place nashville downtown in november 2013, a joint development project with White lodging services, whose early operating perfor- mance has significantly exceeded our expectations;
3 We continued to lower our leverage levels through improved asset values and debt reduction. We also refinanced existing
debt thereby significantly reducing average interest rates and lengthening our average debt maturities, further solidifying the investment grade rating for our senior debt;
3 In 2013, we declared over $345 million in dividends, or $0.46 per share in 2013, representing a 53% increase over the prior year. on February 19, 2014, we announced the thirteenth straight increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.14 per common share.
as we look to 2014, we continue to believe that the strong overall fundamentals in the lodging industry should drive improve- ments in RevPaR growth and operating results. through our continual focus on quality and our disciplined approach to capital allocation, we have structured a premium portfolio that is well- positioned to reap the benefits of the improving economies in our target markets. at the same time, our prudent financial manage- ment means that we will be able to timely execute on opportunities throughout the lodging cycle.
We are convinced that our combination of quality assets, financial strength and management expertise creates an attrac- tive opportunity for our company and investors. We appreciate your support and will continue to strive for increased stock- holder value.
