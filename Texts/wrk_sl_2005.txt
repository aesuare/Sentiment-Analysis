Dear Shareholders,
In June 2005, we acquired Gulf States Paper Corporation’s bleached board mill and 11 folding carton plants and thereby significantly strengthened our company’s position in our core integrated paper- board and folding carton business. The Demopolis, Alabama, bleached board mill is one of the lowest cost bleached board mills in North America and has operated at full capacity for more than three years, as it has since we acquired it. The market structure and cost environment have favored virgin paperboard mills over coated recycled paperboard mills over at least the last business cycle, so the opportunity to acquire this premier asset in the heart of our core business could not have fit better with our strategy of using our financial strength to improve our business mix and our competitiveness in our core business. The 11 folding carton plants we acquired brought a great customer base with little overlap to Rock-Tenn’s existing customers and broadened our technical and geographic footprint.
At 6.2 times pro forma adjusted EBITDA for the
53 weeks ended April 3, 2005, we thought the
$550 million purchase price for these assets was com- pelling, given the quality of the people, the customers and the physical assets and the opportunities we see for significant cost improvement. Since joining us in June, these 1,900 new Rock-Tenn employees have
far exceeded our expectations. The mill’s earnings have been ahead of expectations and they set several operating records in the few months they have been part of Rock-Tenn. The folding carton plants have also exceeded our expectations, operating with strong volumes and financial results ahead of our plans
and well ahead of last year.

In our acquisition economics, we assumed that
we would lose some of the Gulf States folding carton customers, particularly as we believed that we would close several folding carton plants as we integrated the two plant systems. We did in fact close two plants, but so far we have lost very little business. Our approach has been to identify operating improvements that will benefit our customers as well as achieve the cost synergies we need from the acquisition, and our new customers have been very supportive of our efforts.
Our numbers reflect the initial success of the acquisition. We had forecast earnings accretion in the range of 50–55 cents per share for fiscal 2006 when we felt we would have the initial integration well in hand. In the event, the acquisition was 9 cents per share accretive in the first month alone, and was well ahead of our annualized expectation in the first
full quarter that ended in September. Indeed, by September 2005, we had reduced our net debt to $876 million, representing an implied $72.5 million reduction from our March 31, 2005, pro forma net debt adjusted to reflect the borrowing of the purchase price, again well ahead of our announced target to reduce debt by $180 million by September 2007.
Turning to our historic operations, the first two quarters of fiscal 2005 were disappointing. Tons and volumes were down in our coated recycled mills and folding carton plants and volumes were weak in our display and corrugated packaging businesses. These lower volumes and higher costs for energy, chemicals and freight resulted in much lower margins in our packaging and display segments for the first half of the year. Margins in our paperboard segment improved in the first half of the year due to much better performance

  by our specialty recycled mills and to continuing price recovery of the escalating fiber and energy costs we saw in fiscal 2004. In the second half of the year our margins improved across our businesses as volumes improved. In addition, we continued to realize higher prices for paperboard and our display business mix improved and margins returned to acceptable levels.
These results came from a broad array of initiatives across our businesses. In our mills we have been working on a range of projects to reduce our energy consump- tion, where natural gas and oil price increases continued to climb across the year. Since September 30, 2004, our project teams have implemented energy solutions that have reduced the amount of natural gas and oil we purchase in our recycled mills by .7 billion cubic feet equivalent per year, over 10% of our annual purchases.
Our merchandising display business continued to broaden and deepen its value proposition to our core customers by becoming the recognized leader in theft deterrent, promotional displays and cost reducing innovations in display systems. In fiscal 2005, we also added a team of 15 professionals with outstanding brand management and brand globalization skills to our display business. Our folding carton plants con- tinued their focus on cost reductions and capital efficiency driven in part by steps we took to anticipate integrating the Gulf States folding carton plants.
In connection with the Gulf States acquisition we named a new leadership team for our folding carton business led by Mike Kiepura and the team
of eight leaders pictured on page six. This new team’s goal is to integrate our 27 folding carton plants into

The acquired folding carton facilities increase our geographical footprint in the eastern United States, complement our technological abilities and increase our customer diversification. Following the acquisition, we realigned our folding carton division to ensure integrated decision-making that maximizes plant utilization, our employees’ expertise and our ability to provide packaging solutions to our customers. The Claremont facility pictured above prints and cuts cartons on high-speed web offset presses with electron beam curing that meet the demanding printing requirements of the frozen food and other market segments.

one seamless network of plants with the greatest capabilities in our industry, the lowest costs and the broadest customer base. We selected these leaders based on their demonstrated commitment to opera- tional excellence and continuing innovation.
Throughout Rock-Tenn we will continue to focus on improving our processes with the goal of achieving consistent operational excellence in everything we do. We will undertake a major financial systems and process overhaul this year to simplify and reduce the costs of our financial processes. We believe we can significantly reduce our support costs and our excessive Sarbanes- Oxley compliance costs (which were $4.5 million to third parties alone for fiscal 2005’s certification) by modernizing and streamlining our financial systems. We have not yet announced a savings target or project
cost, but we should have our plans and expectations in hand by midyear fiscal 2006.
All these initiatives and the Gulf States acquisition position us very well to post much better results in fiscal 2006. Over the course of the year we expect
to see our packaging segment margins improve, our display segment margins improve and show significant sales growth in the second half of the year, and our mill segment earnings reflect the impact of the earnings potential of our bleached board mill. The dark cloud over next year is the extreme escalation of natural gas and oil costs, which also drive much higher chemical and freight costs. As I write, the 12-month natural
gas NYMEX strip price is $12.28 per MMBtu, which is $5.13 per MMBtu higher than our average price in fiscal 2005. On an annual basis this represents

approximately $30 million in higher costs to Rock-Tenn for natural gas alone. As a result of these natural gas cost increases, we expect that we will see severely depressed earnings from our coated mills sharply reducing the earnings improvement in our other businesses.
These are challenges we are prepared to meet. Our mills are well positioned on the cost curve
given our aggressive investments to apply technology to reduce costs and energy consumption, we have very good opportunities to optimize our folding car- ton operations and continue to take out costs, and we expect renewed growth in our merchandising display segment. We believe fiscal 2006 will be a year marked by extreme challenges in the winter due to high energy costs followed by the chance for visible earnings
improvement over the second half of the year flowing from the efforts of our 9,600 hardworking, innovative leaders working together to make Rock-Tenn a great place to work, and a great supplier to over 6,000 customers.
