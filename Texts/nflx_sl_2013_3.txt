                                                       January 22, 2014 Fellow Shareholders,
We ended 2013 with over 44 million members. We had higher domestic net additions than in 2012, growing international success, and an impressive first slate of original series. We expect to end Q1 with 48 million members.
Our summary results, and forecast for Q1, are below.

 Domestic
Domestic net additions in Q4 of 2.33 million were 14% higher than prior year Q4 at 2.05 million. The healthy y/y growth in net additions was likely fueled by our service improvements, marketing effectiveness, and sales of Internet connected devices.
We expect this momentum to continue in Q1 with net additions of 2.25 million to exceed the prior year by about 11%. Running equal to, or slightly above, prior year net additions is a great outcome because it implies that at 33 million domestic members we’re still in the middle section of the S curve of consumer adoption, with years of member growth ahead of us.
Our US contribution margin during the quarter increased 420 basis points y/y to 23.4%, as we continued to grow membership and revenue faster than content expense. Over the past 8 quarters since we first broke out the streaming segment, our contribution margin has expanded significantly from the 12.2% posted in Q4’11.
Our strong results indicate that a 30% quarterly contribution margin may start being achievable in 2015. At 30%, we’d re-evaluate the right margin growth target, given conditions at that time. To the extent our contribution margin climbs above 30%, it will get harder to keep it growing at 400 basis points per year.
Last April we introduced a 4-concurrent stream $11.99 option to begin our evaluation of plan tiering. Since late last year, we have also been testing 1-stream and 3-stream variants, as well as SD/HD variations, at various price points. Eventually, we hope to be able to offer new members a selection of three simple options to fit everyone’s taste.
If we do make pricing changes for new members, existing members would get generous grandfathering of their existing plans and prices, so there would be no material near-term revenue increase from moving to this potential broader set of options. We are in no rush to implement such new member plans and are still researching the best way to proceed.
As a reminder, Q2 net additions will typically be less than the prior year, even in a year where total net additions are up, due to increased seasonality that comes with a bigger member base. (See the very end of our Q1 2012 earnings letter for an explanation.) In addition, in Q2 2013 we launched Arrested Development, which had a strong established brand and passionate fan base, generating a small boost in membership, making Q2 2014 a tougher than normal comp period.
Our domestic growth is very strong, much of which should be attributed to the tailwind of Internet video growth in general. Hulu had 3 CEOs in 2013, and yet grew paid subscribers an impressive 65%. We think YouTube, Amazon Instant Video, iTunes video and BBC iPlayer are also growing fast.
In the traditional MVPD sector, there is lots of activity that may affect us on the margin. Verizon is buying the Intel Internet MVPD system and recently bought a CDN (EdgeCast) and streaming software
 2

 firm (UpLynk). These are big investments, so they clearly have big plans. Sony announced they are launching an Internet MVPD system this year. Finally, depending on the decision of the Supreme Court, Aereo will either have to pay for the broadcast content like MVPDs, or the MVPDs will no longer be obliged to pay. Within the MVPD ecosystem, there are potentially big shake ups. In contrast, we continue licensing and producing more exclusive content for our direct-to-consumer business, and are relatively unaffected by the big bundle questions.
International
We’re making great progress internationally, with strong member growth and contribution profit/loss improving sequentially in all of our markets (with the exception of the Netherlands as it had its first full quarter of operations and thus loss in Q4). We saw healthy growth in net additions of 1.74 million in Q4 to end the year at 10.93 million members, slightly above our guidance. As anticipated, Q4 net additions were down slightly from the prior year Q4, as we launched four Nordic markets in Q4 2012 versus the relatively smaller Netherlands launch in Q3 2013.
In Q1 of 2014, we are forecasting an almost 60% increase in net additions from the prior year, from 1.02 million to 1.60 million. We’ve seen increases in consumer brand awareness and likelihood to recommend across markets as our content offering builds and marketing messages are honed, factors that help drive the y/y growth in net additions.
Throughout 2013 we made substantial progress in improving our contribution losses - a 30% improvement over FY 2012 - while also launching a small market. In Q1, we expect to continue this progress and expect a contribution loss of ($42) million, a $15 million sequential improvement.
In Ireland, on January 10th, we increased our monthly subscription price for new members by one Euro from €6.99 to €7.99, bringing Ireland pricing in line with our other Euro-zone countries. Existing members in Ireland received two-year grandfathering of their existing €6.99 pricing. Because of this grandfathering, there will be no material revenue impact from this change in 2014. It’s too early to tell if this change will materially affect our growth in Ireland.
We plan later this year to embark on a substantial European expansion. Our success this year in international net additions and shrinking contribution losses confirms our belief that there is a big international opportunity for Netflix.
Content
We continued to expand our original content offerings in the quarter, launching a second season of Lilyhammer starring Steven Van Zandt, the first five episodes of our first original animated series for
3

 kids, Turbo F.A.S.T., from DreamWorks Animation, original standup comedy specials featuring Aziz Ansari and Russell Peters and the original documentary The Short Game.
So far, Netflix original series have received over 80 major award nominations and wins, including Emmy and Golden Globe recognition of House of Cards, Orange is the New Black, Arrested Development and Hemlock Grove. House of Cards and Orange is the New Black were also included in the American Film Institute’s list of the best 10 TV series of the year. Our recently launched original documentary The Square was also just nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. We could not be more pleased with -- and proud of -- our first slate of original content.
Timed for family viewing over the holidays, Turbo F.A.S.T has been very popular with kids around the world, performing especially strong throughout Latin America. As we had hoped, the global theatrical and home video release of the DreamWorks Animation film based on the same characters helped position the series for success. Though just launched, Turbo F.A.S.T. is on track to become one of the most popular kids series ever on Netflix.
The second season of Lilyhammer was our first ever for a Netflix original series. The show is finding a broader audience, as we have introduced new English speaking characters and more global storylines. Season 3 has recently begun production in Norway and the creators again plan to add characters that will further broaden the appeal of this already very international show.
In 2014, we anticipate building on our tremendous momentum with new seasons of House of Cards (Feb. 14th), Derek, Hemlock Grove, Orange is the New Black, Lilyhammer, and a fully exclusive, final season of The Killing; as well as additional episodes of Turbo F.A.S.T., and premiere launches of our first original animated series for adults, BoJack Horseman, and an epic series based on the adventures of Marco Polo from The Weinstein Co., and additional new kids series from DreamWorks Animation.
We’re also thrilled to continue to bring high quality documentaries exclusively to our members. In addition to The Square, later this week we’ll globally release MITT, the Gala premiere opening film at the Sundance Film Festival this year.
Looking into early 2015, we anticipate the release of the first season of Sense8 from the Wachowski siblings and J. Michael Straczynski, the as-yet unnamed project from the creators of Damages, and Daredevil, the first series from our recently announced deal with Marvel Television.
Beyond our fully original series, Netflix will exclusively premiere new episodes of Better Call Saul, the hotly anticipated spin-off of Breaking Bad in the UK and Ireland, throughout Latin America, the Nordics and the Netherlands. Those episodes will premiere in North America on Netflix following their run on AMC. As part of that deal, we expanded and extended our exclusive deal for the entire Breaking Bad series to all of our territories. The final 8 episodes of the now iconic show will hit Netflix in North America on Feb. 24th. Breaking Bad has proven to be a global success for us and we expect Better Call Saul to be very popular with our members as well.

 Marketing
In the US we launched in late November a new holiday campaign called “It Just Might Bring Everyone Together”. The ad is simple and timely and positions Netflix as a part of the holiday/family experience.
We made steady progress in our international marketing efforts this quarter. We launched a new campaign in Brazil introducing Netflix to a broader audience with positive results in terms of brand awareness and familiarity of the attributes of our service. We also launched a new advertising campaign in Canada over the holidays that played into the deep Canadian affection for hockey.
Product
We ended 2013 with our best product ever and one substantially better than a year ago. Notably during Q4, we rolled out our new user-interface for TV devices, a material step forward not only objectively in terms of engagement metrics, but in terms of press and public attention. This user interface is coupled with our new technology platform for TV devices, which has a smaller footprint and is higher performing, allowing us to reach lower-powered devices and enabling future growth into new areas.
During the quarter, we also completed the roll out of the Netflix streaming application into Virgin Media’s set-top box for UK members and have been quite pleased with the implementation and reception. We followed up with two similar platforms based on the same technology, Denmark’s Waoo! which went live in Q4, and Com Hem in Sweden, which was just recently launched. We anticipate rolling out our first domestic MVPD integrations soon with some of the smaller MVPDs.
At CES this year, we promoted Ultra High Definition (UHD) 4K technology with several key consumer electronics partners, announcing that House of Cards season 2 will be in 4K as well as all 5 seasons of Breaking Bad, and our future original series. 4K streams are encoded at 15.6Mbps, well within reach of a significant minority of our members, and the reach of capable 20Mbps broadband connections will continue to grow. Since the number of 4K displays sold in 2014 and the number of available hours of 4K content both will be relatively modest, the short-term impact of 4K is mainly on consumer perception of Netflix as a leader in Internet TV.
We continue to invest in personalization for content discovery, which adds value to our content catalogs by presenting more relevant content to each user, driving more hours of viewing and better retention. In January, we received our second Emmy Award for Technical Achievement in recognition of our personalization technology.
      5

 Net Neutrality
Unfortunately, Verizon successfully challenged the U.S. net neutrality rules. In principle, a domestic ISP now can legally impede the video streams that members request from Netflix, degrading the experience we jointly provide. The motivation could be to get Netflix to pay fees to stop this degradation. Were this draconian scenario to unfold with some ISP, we would vigorously protest and encourage our members to demand the open Internet they are paying their ISP to deliver.
The most likely case, however, is that ISPs will avoid this consumer-unfriendly path of discrimination. ISPs are generally aware of the broad public support for net neutrality and don’t want to galvanize government action.
Moreover, ISPs have very profitable broadband businesses they want to expand. Consumers purchase higher bandwidth packages mostly for one reason: high-quality streaming video. ISPs appear to recognize this and many of them are working closely with us and other streaming video services to enable the ISPs subscribers to more consistently get the high-quality streaming video consumers desire.
In the long-term, we think Netflix and consumers are best served by strong network neutrality across all networks, including wireless. To the degree that ISPs adhere to a meaningful voluntary code of conduct, less regulation is warranted. To the degree that some aggressive ISPs start impeding specific data flows, more regulation would clearly be needed.
DVD
6.9 million DVD members continue to value the tremendous selection we offer on DVD.
Contribution profit was roughly stable at $110 million. We expect $98 million in contribution profit for Q1, which reflects the postal rate increase implemented this month and higher seasonal usage.
In the coming months, we’ll begin using dvd.netflix.com on our envelopes and on the DVD web pages. The dvd.netflix.com logo will feature our iconic envelope in a nod to our DVD-by-mail heritage, representing the huge selection that DVD offers; nearly every movie ever made.
Free Cash Flow and Capital
Free cash flow was $5 million in Q4 compared to $48 million of net income, mostly due to cash spending on content being higher than P&L expense. While our cash and equivalents has risen to $1.2 billion, we anticipate embarking on substantially more international expansion and originals funding over the next few years. Given the current favorable interest rate environment, we think a prudent step in Q1 is to
6

 raise an additional $400 million of long-term debt on terms similar to our $500 million raise last year. At $900 million of total long term debt, we will have an extremely modest debt to equity ratio.
Business Outlook
Starting this quarter we are providing you our internal forecast numbers for the quarter in the table at the beginning of this letter. This internal forecast is based upon the first few weeks of the quarter, the historical pattern and other factors. This is our raw internal best-guess forecast, so we should land above it sometimes and below it sometimes.
Our goal in this modest change of communication is to increase transparency and to simplify our message.
Summary
It’s been a good year for Netflix. People around the world want what we offer: consumer-in-control Internet television.
Sincerely,
Reed Hastings, CEO David Wells, CFO

   Use of Non-GAAP Measures
This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the non-GAAP financial measures of free cash flow. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measures, during a given period, the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities. However, this non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to the GAAP equivalent of this non-GAAP measure is contained in tabular form on the attached unaudited financial statements.
Forward-Looking Statements
This shareholder letter contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements regarding domestic contribution margin targets; pricing structure and changes; expansion into new geographic markets and the impact of international expansion; investments in content and content offerings, including original content; impact of technology developments such as 4K and growth of high speed broadband connections; impacts relating to net neutrality; business outlook for our DVD segment, including contribution profit; obtaining additional capital; member growth domestically and internationally, including net, total and paid; revenue, contribution profit (loss) and contribution margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated net income and earnings per share for the first quarter of 2014. The forward-looking statements in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ, including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion
8

 of device platforms for instant streaming; fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; disruption in service on our website and systems or with third-party computer systems that help us operate our service; competition; and, widespread consumer adoption of different modes of viewing in-home filmed entertainment. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 1, 2013. The Company provides internal forecast numbers. Investors should anticipate that actual performance will vary from these forecast numbers based on risks and uncertainties discussed above and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder letter.
