                     The last three years presented unique challenges
to all businesses, and CarMax was no exception. However, we weathered the economic storm and have now produced two back-to-back years of record results. In fiscal 2011, we are proud to report that total revenues increased 20% to $8.98 billion, while net earnings improved 35% to $380.9 million, or $1.67 per diluted share.
Our results demonstrate what can be accomplished when we challenge ourselves to take a crisis and
turn it into an opportunity. It was during this time of economic upheaval that we launched Building a Better CarMax, which includes focused programs to support three primary initiatives: develop our associates and provide them the tools for success, drive execution by improving the car-buying experience for customers and discover efficiencies by reducing waste.
Associate training and development are often early casualties in a business downturn. CarMax took
a different approach. We chose to dramatically increase our efforts in this area, including introducing Professional Selling Principles training and renewing our focus on having experienced mentors to assist with new associate training. We believe these invest- ments laid the foundation for our improvements in sales conversion in the last two years.
This past year, we introduced a comprehensive upgrade to MaxCare, our customized extended service plan. The redesigned MaxCare allows customers to build their own plan, with choices on deductibles, coverage and cost. Response to the new product has been favorable, with a resulting increase in service plan sales.
In December, we launched our carmax.com mobile website, which was specifically designed to improve the experience of customers accessing our site from web-enabled phones. This application was well received, and it already accounts for approximately 10% of our website visits.
Fiscal 2011 was a record year for our wholesale auc- tions, where we topped $1 billion in sales on a 33% increase in units sold. During the year, we rolled out a new and dramatically improved carmaxauctions.com web- site, providing new tools and functionality to our whole- sale customers, including a more robust search engine, vehicle photos and customer-driven inventory alerts.
Also in fiscal 2011, we continued our efforts to increase reconditioning process consistency and elimi- nate waste, while still maintaining overall vehicle qual- ity. In recent years, we estimate that we have achieved a cumulative sustainable reduction in reconditioning costs of approximately $250 per vehicle as a result of

                these efforts, while simultaneously realizing a steady improvement in vehicle quality scores. This represents roughly $100 million of savings that are available to optimize our sales and profitability.
During the year, we resumed geographic growth, open- ing three stores in Augusta, Cincinnati and Dayton, all of which are new markets for CarMax. We are actively working to fill the real estate pipeline and build the management bench necessary to support future
store growth. Currently, we expect to open five stores in fiscal 2012 and between eight and ten stores in fiscal 2013. We remain confident that we are well positioned for growth. Despite being by far the larg- est retailer of used cars in the U.S., we estimate our share of the late-model used vehicle market is less than 3%. With just 103 used car superstores at year end, we were in markets representing less than half the U.S. population. We believe geographic expansion and additional fill-in opportunities in existing markets should fuel our growth for years to come.
We closed fiscal 2011 with a healthy balance sheet and the liquidity to support our growth plans. During the year, CarMax Auto Finance took several steps to mitigate the risk of future dislocations in the credit markets, including establishing a second warehouse facility with a staggered renewal date and increasing the overall warehouse capacity. In addition, we took steps that we believe give our third-party finance pro- viders an even better appreciation of the advantages of our unique finance origination channel.
While pleased with our recent achievements, we believe that we can continue to improve every aspect of our business. As we look to the future, we are excited about initiatives underway to make more of the car-buying process available to customers online. We recently implemented CarMax EasyShop in two test stores. This initiative gives customers a fast and flexible online alternative for some of the most time- consuming aspects of buying a car. Using CarMax EasyShop, customers can put a car on hold, set up an appointment, order and pay for a transfer of a vehicle from another CarMax store, apply for financing, select a MaxCare plan and get a jump on much of the paperwork. We look forward to continuing to find more ways to make car-buying the way it should be.
In closing, I want to again thank our associates, customers and shareholders for their continuing sup- port. I cannot give enough credit to all the associates who play pivotal roles in our success as we continue Building a Better CarMax and who are the foundation of our long-term performance. Their unwavering com- mitment to customer service allowed us to not just survive the recession but to emerge an even stronger company. I am proud to be part of this winning team.
