TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES AND FRIENDS,
The opening pages of this book introduce you to Matt, Ana and Al. They are three of the nearly 4,000 employees of Gilead Sciences -- 4,000 individuals with diverse roles and backgrounds who share a singular focus...

...and that focus is on doing what we can, every day, to help other individuals around the world who are living with unmet medical needs. In 2009, we grew our business substantially, achieving record revenues of more than $7 billion and strengthening our product portfolio and pipeline programs across four primary therapeutic areas. I believe we were able to realize these achievements because we view our work as more than a business. We are a community of people, working in partnership toward a shared vision. The diseases we focus on affect tens of millions of individuals around the world, and they represent challenges for the physicians who treat them, for the patients and their families who live with them, and for our researchers and our collaborators who work to find new ways to combat them. Today, more than 33 million individuals around the world are living with HIV/AIDS. The disease remains one of Gilead's primary areas of commercial and research and development focus and the cornerstone of our business. In the United States, 75 percent of HIV patients on treatment are now receiving one of Gilead's products. Our once-daily fixed-dose tablet Atripla® was the most-prescribed HIV treatment regimen, and Truvada® , taken as part of combination therapy, remained the mostprescribed HIV product during 2009. In Europe, Truvada and Atripla became the number one and two brands, respectively, in Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Even with this commercial success, we recognize there is much more to be done. In the United States, at least 20 percent of individuals living with HIV ­ or approximately 250,000 people ­ are unaware they have the disease. During 2009, support continued to grow for routine testing to help diagnose individuals living with HIV, prevent late diagnoses that make the virus harder to treat and prevent new infections. In August, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs began offering routine, voluntary HIV testing at

facilities nationwide. The October extension of the Ryan White CARE Act established ­ for the first time ­ a national goal to screen five million people each year. These developments will help make HIV tests and ultimately treatment more accessible. Gilead is actively supporting programs to diagnose and link to care individuals living with HIV in the hardest hit and often most underserved communities. And we are looking at all facets of HIV disease, including prevention. Gilead is supporting ongoing trials around the world to evaluate whether taking our antiretroviral medicines could help protect at-risk individuals from becoming infected with HIV, a potentially groundbreaking HIV prevention strategy called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. The first efficacy results for PrEP are expected in 2010. Like HIV, chronic hepatitis B is a disease where many individuals are not aware they are living with the virus. Left untreated, chronic hepatitis B can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. We are pursuing efforts to expand access to information and care in communities most affected by chronic hepatitis B ­ a disease with a disproportionate impact on individuals of Asian descent. We have demonstrated, through long-term clinical trials, the potential of Viread® to lower viral load and thus decrease damage to the liver. Viread is now recommended as a first-line treatment for HBV in guidelines issued by U.S. and European medical societies, and continues to gain share in these markets as one of the most frequently prescribed oral antivirals for patients with chronic hepatitis B. On the cardiovascular front, we expanded our portfolio with the acquisition of CV Therapeutics in April, which brought us Ranexa® for the treatment of chronic angina. We continued to drive uptake of Letairis® for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a disease that affects approximately 200,000 patients worldwide. We also broadened our efforts to support Phase IV studies of Letairis, and are collaborating with GlaxoSmithKline on an international, event-driven clinical trial, called AMBITION, to study combination therapy versus monotherapy in a first-line treatment setting for PAH.

In addition, we received conditional approval of Cayston® for the treatment of lung infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the European Union and Canada. Data from our head-to-head study of Cayston versus tobramycin, which would support full approval in these territories, is expected toward the middle part of this year. In early 2010, Cayston received approval in the United States and Australia. Cayston represents the first new inhaled antibiotic approved for patients with CF in more than a decade. Our first therapy in the category of respiratory disease ­ Tamiflu® ­ proved to be an important component in the global fight against the H1N1 strain of influenza during 2009. Tamiflu was developed by Gilead and licensed to F. Hoffmann-La Roche, our global commercialization partner. Beyond our commercial products, we made significant progress with our pipeline in 2009. Across our research and development programs, hundreds of Gilead scientists are working to create and develop new compounds for the treatment of HIV,

liver disease and serious cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. For HIV, we have several compounds in late-stage clinical trials and new combination treatments on the horizon. In collaboration with Tibotec Pharmaceuticals, we are developing a new once-daily single-tablet regimen combining Truvada with Tibotec's non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor candidate, rilpivirine. If approved, this product would be the first alternative to Atripla with the potential to offer an improved side effect profile. We hope to file applications for regulatory approval of this product in the second half of 2010. We are also excited about a development-stage product that combines our investigational HIV integrase inhibitor, elvitegravir, and cobicistat (formerly GS 9350), our investigational pharmacoenhancing or "boosting" agent, with Truvada, creating a new once-daily, fixed-dose regimen, known informally as the "Quad." Phase II studies of the Quad and of cobicistat as a stand-alone agent have been completed, and pending discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, our goal is to initiate Phase III studies by the middle of this year.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

We continue to develop treatments for hepatitis C and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including our caspase inhibitor GS 9450, now being evaluated in Phase II studies. With the additional expertise and resources gained from the CV Therapeutics acquisition, we have greatly improved our ability to advance research and development of treatments for serious cardiovascular conditions with unmet needs. We are evaluating the potential for Ranexa and next-generation late sodium current inhibitors in a number of additional indications and settings, including for the treatment of patients with diastolic heart failure. And, GS 9667, a partial A1 adenosine receptor agonist, is being evaluated as a potential treatment for diabetes. The potential of our products ­ those available today and the next generation in development ­ can and will only be realized if patients have access to those therapies. First and foremost, we believe responsible pricing is the best way to ensure broad access. We also recognize that many patients face challenges affording prescription medications. Through Advancing® Access, Atripla Patient Assistance, GileadTMSolutions and the Cayston® Access Program, we assist patients in the United States who do not have insurance or who need additional financial help to pay for our medicines. We also assist patients who have insurance coverage for prescription medications but are unable to bear the full cost of their co-payments.

Worldwide, more than 1 million individuals received one of Gilead's four HIV medications during 2009. More than half of these patients live in resourcelimited parts of the world. To reach these patients, we have partnered with 13 Indian generic companies to develop generic versions of our HIV medications and distribute them in 95 countries, including India. Gilead provides charitable contributions to a broad range of non-profit organizations. Through the Gilead Foundation, we also support efforts worldwide to expand access to disease education and improve infrastructure and health services. The Gilead team is a diverse group of people, working in laboratories, offices and communities around the world. We benefit from the guidance and leadership of our Board of Directors, and in 2009 we welcomed Kevin Lofton, President and CEO of Catholic Health Initiatives, and, in 2010, Per Wold-Olsen, Retired President of the Human Health Intercontinental Division of Merck & Co., to the Board. To each of you ­ our stockholders, our employees and our friends ­ I thank you for your continued support and belief in our mission. You are a part of the Gilead community ­ one built over the past 20 years and one from which we will continue to grow and bring new medications to those in need. Sincerely,
