 deAr shAreholders & friends,

Chief executive officer
As you know, 2010 was another difficult year for our country, our customers and our business. The lingering downturn in construction activity produced weak private sector demand in all markets. Our year-end numbers unfortunately reflected this weakness.
 While our unit cash margin for aggregates is near record highs, some 26 percent higherthanatthepeakofdemandin2005, volumes remain low and our downstream products—ready-mixed concrete and asphalt — have been hit particularly hard.
Our strategy of expanding our footprint within the country’s primary growth markets, and securing valuable aggre- gates reserves near key population cen- ters, remains sound, and has served our shareholders well throughout our long history — especially through the lens of the long-term view.
However, this annual report is about the near term. And, while there are some indications that the economy on which we depend is stirring back to life, the near-term outlook for our business still indicates that there are challenges ahead.
Progress
There has been some good news. Stim- ulus funding for highways provided much-needed jobs and projects across the nation, including in those states where we operate and which we serve.
Key Vulcan-served states continue to benefit the most from highway proj- ects related to the American Recov- ery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). For example, Vulcan states were appor- tioned 55 percent more stimulus funds than non-Vulcan states. At this writ- ing, according to the Federal High- way Administration, some 40 percent of stimulus funds obligated for high- ways in Vulcan-served states remains to be spent. Momentum, however, has picked up and we expect the remain- ing funds to be fully spent over the next year and a half.

The federal Highway Trust Fund was restored to solvency by the HIRE Act in March 2010, with reserves that should provide sufficient time for Congress to enact longer-term funding solutions for highway programs.
our resPonse
Our people have done an outstanding job managing our business under very adverse circumstances. Vulcan has been through major downturns before and, as history has shown, we have always emerged as a stronger and more efficient aggregates company.
During this challenging business envi- ronment, we have continued our com- prehensive management response to this extended crisis by driving costs down, maintaining aggregates margins, focus- ing on generating cash, serving our cus- tomers and continuing to pay dividends to our shareholders.

With tireless operational discipline, we are managing our costs. We underwent some painful but necessary personnel downsizing to bring our enterprise into better alignment with current market conditions. To underscore the success of bold management actions, our aggregates unit cash margin has stayed strong, near

historic highs, despite a 50 percent drop in demand for aggregates since the peak of this cycle.
We continue to invest in systems to improve efficiency. While our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) project— undertaken to replace legacy systems and streamline many internal processes — raised short-term costs, over the long term it will help significantly lower costs while making our people and processes more productive.
our undeniable sTrengThs
We bring many strengths to bear. Our well-maintained and efficient plants have available production capacity that will allow us to respond rapidly to upticks in demand. Our production capacity remains intact. We will add operating hours and employees to meet recovering demand. Our growth-market footprint is unmatched. Our workforce is well trained and highly motivated to succeed.
We are primarily an aggregates business, and our downstream products, in partic- ular asphalt and ready-mixed concrete, consume Vulcan-produced aggregates. Some 95 percent of our revenues is ulti- mately tied to our aggregates operations.
We are focused on long-term value cre- ation, and always have been. And over

time, our long-term investors have greatly benefited from their ownership positions in Vulcan.
The long View
The United States remains a dynamic country, and is still growing, particularly in Vulcan-served states, where 78 percent of the country’s total population growth over the next decade is projected to occur. Five of Vulcan’s most important states by revenue — California, Texas, Florida, Georgia and Virginia — are projected to account for 48 percent of this growth.
There are no indications that this pop- ulation growth will abate or reverse, and we have every reason to conclude that increasing populations will drive increased demand for our essential prod- ucts. When the economy does improve, future demand will be great. Economic growth consumes and depends upon aggregates — and in the nation’s dynamic growth markets we have high-quality reserves and proximity to end-use proj- ects, and our distribution systems are sec- ond to none.
Vulcan is well-prepared and well- positioned to weather this extended eco- nomic storm and respond immediately to resurgence in demand. We have built, through hard work and discipline, as well as through acquisitions — some bold,

                 some questioned at first but ultimately successful — the nation’s leading aggre- gates business. Our coast-to-coast footprint aligns almost exactly with the country’s traditional and projected growth centers. Our operations are lean but primed to meet the demands of growth. The essential major capital expenditures we need to handle the recovery have been made. We are ready.
hisTory on our side
Our business model has always embraced growth through acquisition. It makes perfect sense given the nature of our still highly fragmented industry. Over time, it has become increasingly difficult to source and get permits to mine new reserves of quality stone, especially near and within major metropolitan areas and other growth centers. It is no accident that during the past 20 years we have acquired 254 separate aggregates operations.
After major acquisitions, it has often taken time to show the true value of the transaction. In this business, we have to be fiscally responsible and make every effort to please our shareholders quar- terly. We must also manage for the long term because ours is a business built on having decades of reserves and pro- duction facilities that can operate for many years without major upgrades or reserves depletion.
In 1999 we purchased Calmat, with oper- ations in California, Arizona and New Mexico, thus forming our current West- ern Division. At the time, it was our larg- est acquisition to date and it was greeted with some skepticism. The next year we acquired the U.S. aggregates assets of Tarmac, further expanding our signifi- cant footprint on the Eastern Seaboard. Some thought we were being too aggres- sive with our approach to acquisitions. But, as with every acquisition, we inte- grated the operations well, applied our operational discipline, and in time the acquired operations proved to be highly productive contributors to our bottom line and an integral part of the Vulcan legacy. It is one of our core strengths to take good operations in good markets and then make them into great ones.
Clearly, the current challenges we face, as part of the national construction sec- tor that remains in deep recession, have been compounded by the timing of the Florida Rock acquisition. While boosting our presence in high-growth markets, enhancing our aggregates reserves and bolting on to our existing operations, this major acquisition also raised our expo- sure to suddenly devastated markets, with Florida being the worst. In Florida, we have had disappointing results and been challenged in the near term. How- ever, in Maryland, Virginia and Georgia, where the Florida Rock acquisition added
bolt-on facilities to our existing aggregates operations, the results have been bet- ter. Given this unprecedented economic environment, and with the benefit of hindsight, we understand the criticism of this acquisition. We had the choice of making the acquisition or passing on the opportunity. And we strongly believe that the opportunity is there, and that this acquisition, like others we have done, will ultimately prove itself, to the great ben- efit of shareholders.
As our first 50 years show, we know how to outperform the markets. And the aggre- gates business retains its attractive mar- ket fundamentals. Prices for aggregates, our primary product, have remained rel- atively stable through this downturn. In every recession since 1970, when demand has experienced a steep decline, it has been followed by sustained double-digit growth periods. The current decline has been long and deep, but it appears that we have reached the bottom.
inVesTing in infrasTruCTure
There’s no question or controversy about it: America’s infrastructure is aging and increasingly inadequate to meet the needs of our economy. In many cases it is well beyond capacity and in need of criti- cal repair and upgrades. The population continues to grow and is placing increas- ing demands on existing transportation

systems, water and sewer systems, and other public works. Many of these are approaching the limits of their lifespans and utility. The American Society of Civil Engineers, in its 2009 Report Card for America’s Infrastructure, gave a “D” grade to U.S. infrastructure, and a “D–” to America’s highways. There is only one solution to this problem — greater pub- lic investment, significant and sustained over time, and further bolstered by public-private partnerships.
Washington is torn between policies intended to promote economic recov- ery and those intended to reduce the deficit. As a nation, we are still strug- gling to form consensus around the vitally important issue of maintaining and improving our infrastructure. It is a question of leadership and political will in a contentious political environ- ment where the scope and scale of infra- structure investment remain subjects of intense debate, even though the ques- tion of need is already settled.
We and many other allies are vigorously pressing Congress for a new multi-year federalhighwayprogram.Suchaprogram would address two pressing issues: the condition of our nation’s infrastructure andtheneedtocreatejobs.Thereauthori- zation of the federal Highway Bill is separate and distinct from government stimulus programs. It is essential for the promotion of commerce and a sound
U.S. economy and it thereby promotes jobs. At some point, infrastructure investment becomes not just a safety or baseline economic issue, but also a national security one. There has always been a national defense purpose to the Interstates, which are officially known as the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense High- ways. Most people in Washington and in the state houses recognize that the country needs a well-functioning high- way system to support commerce, the movement of essential goods and ser- vices, and our personal safety as we travel. We and groups in our industry, as well as highway users generally, con- tinue to work tirelessly to prompt Con- gress to act. While there have been delays in the federal Highway Bill, many state and local infrastructure-related ballot initiatives have recently passed by wide margins — further proof of the importance placed on infrastructure by the American people.
Federally legislated stimulus funds for highways, at 3.5 percent of the total stim- ulus package, were woefully inadequate to the task of truly kick-starting the con- struction economy. Nevertheless, stimu- lus funds for infrastructure projects have been helpful to our business. The current Administration continues to state its support for further investment in jobs and infrastructure, but it faces many daunting tasks besides this one.
Despite the clear and documented need, the political outlook with respect to the federal highway program remains some- what challenging. As of this writing, key authorizing committees in the U.S. House and Senate are working on a new Highway Bill, with the intention of mov- ing it in Congress this year. Additionally, the President’s fiscal year 2012 budget request to Congress includes the frame- work for a robust, multi-year transporta- tion bill, including a 48 percent increase in funding for highways over six years. We and others in the industry are working to educate many new members of Congress on the necessity and wisdom of govern- ment investment in infrastructure, at all times and particularly in light of the state of decay and disrepair of our coun- try’s essential transportation systems and public works.
whaT will Turn Things around
Like everyone else in this economy, we await recovery in residential and non- residential construction markets. These private sector markets will recover. They always have.
As the economy appears to have stabilized and shows signs of recovery, there are several factors that make us more opti- mistic about the prospects for growth in 2011. From the perspective of the overall economy, most GDP forecasts for the United States indicate additional

growth in 2011. In past economic cycles, demand for aggregates has improved as GDP has grown during the initial years of economic recovery. Additionally, state and local tax revenues have been increas- ing for the last four quarters ending December 2010, according to an indepen- dent research organization for state and local government. This pattern appears to be consistent with past cycles, where state and local tax revenues have rebounded after GDP recovers. Since the second quar- ter of 2009, all Vulcan-served states have also shown positive growth in gross state product — an indication economic recov- ery is under way. Our analysis of current factors and trends also indicates that the country has reached the bottom of the trough in housing starts and some sec- tors of non-residential construction. How long we stay there remains to be seen.
The current construction cycle appears to be following historical recovery pat- terns. Looking at our aggregates ship- ments during the last five economic cycles, we appear to be beyond the deep- est point of the trough and trending toward recovery.
I am immensely proud of our manage- ment team and employees throughout our Company who have done so much to run the business efficiently and well through this difficult period. When the construction economy begins a more robust recovery, I am confident our

ManageMenT uPdaTe
In December, Vulcan’s Board of Directors approved senior management changes that were effective February 1, 2011. Danny Shepherd was elected to the posi- tion of Executive Vice President — Con- struction Materials and Dan Sansone to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Danny has more than 25 years of experience with the Company. Dan joined Vulcan in 1988.
Following the previously announced February 1, 2011 retirement of Ron McAbee, Senior Vice President — West, Danny has responsibility for all of Vulcan’s operating divisions and the Corporate Construc- tion Materials functions that support division operations.
In addition to continuing as Vulcan’s Chief Financial Officer, Dan now also has responsibility for the Marketing Support Services group and oversight of the business development and strategic planning functions.
It is with great sadness that I must report the passing of a dear friend to countless people both within and outside the Com- pany. Houston Blount, former Vulcan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, passed away in early January 2011. Houston’s leadership, charm, humor and business acumen were legendary. A tribute to Houston is on the next page.
