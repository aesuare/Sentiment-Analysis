Our achievements last year began over a decade ago with a dream of using technology to transform the way financial services were marketed to consumers: We believed we could benefit consumers by customizing products to meet individual needs on a mass scale, replacing "one-size-fits-all" offers with unique solutions for every person. We also believed we could create an environment where incredibly talented people could take risks, innovate and spread their wings. Some thought this dream wouldn’t fly. But today it is clear that the dream has taken flight. Earnings growth and return on equity in 2000 topped 20% for the sixth consecutive year, a record equaled by only a handful of the country’s 10,000 public companies. It has been especially grat- ifying to sustain this peak financial performance while fulfilling our mission to democratize credit, making it accessible to many more customers. We said after our initial public offering that we would serve customers across the financial spectrum, offering the lowest price in each market segment without compromising profit- ability, and we kept our word.
The long-term success and the achievements of the year just ended have been driven by our proprietary information-based strategy (IBS). IBS follows a rigorous scientific testing protocol to find successful products. Major marketing investments are held in reserve until promising ideas can be proven. IBS also supports supe- rior risk analysis, which we use to mass customize our products, structuring every account to the customer’s preferences and risk profile.
Before IBS, the credit card industry managed risk by charging all customers the same high interest rates and refusing credit to those who did not fit narrow credit parameters. IBS transformed the industry. Annual interest rates for most cardholders fell by one-third, and the door was opened wide, giving millions of con- sumers their first access to credit.

 Since then we have extended IBS to installment loans, auto finance, money market accounts and certifi- cates of deposit. We are a price leader in all of these markets, each of which offers us a large platform for growth. New businesses open new fields for innovation. Deposit accounts, for example, give Capital One an alternative source of funding—one more buffer against downdrafts in corporate credit markets. Deposits at year-end totaled $8.4 billion, financing 25% of our total managed assets.
We have recently taken IBS into other industries through strategic alliances with Kmart® and BMG Entertainment.® The Kmart alliance, launched in September, brought Capital One more than one million new customers during the last quarter of the year. The co-branded Visa® card and rewards program for BMG Entertainment offer numerous benefits to music fans. In South Africa, we are marketing credit cards and other products through a joint venture with Nedcor®, one of the country’s leading financial institutions. We view these alliances as prototypes for ventures with market leaders in other industries.
To maximize the benefits of the learning and momentum generated by IBS, we are now committing sub- stantial resources to building Capital One’s brand through advertising, sponsorship and other customer “touch points.” These new efforts are guided by our long-standing conviction that the best way to build a brand is to live it. We want Capital One to be the brand consumers prefer when they're in the market for financial services.
IBS has made Capital One a formidable competitor and—just as we dreamed—a transformational force in financial services. With 34 million customers, we have one of the world’s largest consumer franchises. The Company also has used IBS to build enormous operational strength. IBS provides the ultimate precision tools for risk management, which we have used to achieve one of the industry's lowest charge-off rates, increasing our marketing opportunities and improving our financial performance. We use IBS to track and continuously improve customer service and operating efficiency. In human resources, IBS helps us identify the strongest job candidates and reduce recruiting costs.
Our associates even take Capital One’s passion for achieving measurable results to the work they do with community organizations. They have chosen to focus on helping children at risk, and in 2000 more than half of them volunteered in Capital One-sponsored community programs, collectively contributing in excess of 50,000 hours of service. They facilitate interagency collaboration, share technology and resources, and use their analytical and managerial know-how to assist in evaluating and refining community services. Early in 2001, social investments made by Capital One and its associates were recognized with one of the most pres- tigious honors in American philanthropy, a Points of Light Foundation® Award for Excellence in Corporate Community Service.
Thanks to IBS, which lets us quickly scale our business up or down, we believe we are well prepared for a slowdown in the economy or a decline in consumer credit quality. Our financial structure is the strongest it has ever been. We also have built-in buffers that will mitigate the impact of a recession on earnings, for exam- ple, we have the lowest average credit lines in the industry, which limits potential losses per account. In addi- tion, the steady diversification of our product lines and our customer base has increased financial stability while expanding possibilities for growth.
In 2000, we significantly reduced the cost of serving each customer, from $89 to $81, for an annualized saving of more than $200 million, and we did it without compromising service quality, associate morale or operating flexibility.
From our associates, from the marketplace, from Wall Street and from other quarters, there is growing recognition that Capital One is a topflight company. That’s what we have always worked for. And from the beginning we’ve had a destination clearly in mind. It’s a beacon just past the horizon, invisible to the naked eye but not beyond the dreams of the people of Capital One. Over the next year they will strive for another record financial performance (with earnings up 30%, by our estimate). And they will carry out thousands of new test flights so that Capital One can continue to break through price and risk barriers, carrying consumers and shareholders to new heights.
