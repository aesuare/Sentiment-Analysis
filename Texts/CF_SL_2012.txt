Dear Stockholder,

Stephen R. Wilson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer

2012 was an exceptional year for CF Industries. Robust grain market fundamentals led to record demand for our products. We benefitted from the plentiful supply of North American natural gas, which kept the price of our primary feedstock at attractive levels. Outstanding execution by our sales, production and logistics teams enabled us to take full advantage of the opportunities the market afforded us. We produced and shipped a record 15 million product tons of plant nutrients and earned record net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $1.8 billion, or $28.59 per diluted share, on record net sales of $6.1 billion. Our performance in 2012 underscores the competitive strengths of our company. As North America's leading provider of nitrogen fertilizer and a major provider of phosphate fertilizer, we are in an excellent position to support the plant nutrient needs of farmers who use our products to increase the yield and quality of their crops. We are proud of CF Industries' contributions to feeding the world's growing population as we continue to create value for our customers and shareholders. Our actions and the results they generated during 2012 reflect the drive and confidence of a business staffed by extraordinary people. Our employees range from professionals with decades of experience to talented individuals just beginning their careers. The individuals featured in this report represent all of the 2,500 CF Industries employees who contributed to another record-setting year for our company.

Excellent Fertilizer Market Conditions
From the perspective of a crop nutrient manufacturer, it would be difficult to imagine a better business setting than the one we experienced in 2012. An extended spring fertilizer application season, along with an exceptionally large number of corn acres planted in the United States, led to very strong demand for plant nutrients in the first half of the year. In an unfortunate turn for farmers, the weather that was so conducive to field preparation and planting work turned harshly hot and dry, withering crops and sending grain prices soaring. Thankfully, many farmers had crop insurance which protected them financially and helped provide liquidity for them heading into the 2013 planting season. The dry weather, along with early crop maturity, led to an early harvest. Fields were clear and ready for nutrient applications much earlier than normal, which positioned the North American fertilizer industry for an extended fall application season. High corn prices provided the incentive for North American farmers to plan for another large crop planting in 2013. The field work to prepare for that planting generated exceptional demand for ammonia and phosphates throughout the fall, helping CF Industries conclude a record-setting year on a high note. The low cost of natural gas was a significant contributor to the record margins the company generated in 2012. Mild weather and continued growth in production helped drive natural gas prices to 10-year lows. While these prices were low compared to historical averages, more importantly they were low compared to natural gas prices in many other regions of the world. This cost differential is a key advantage for us as a producer of nitrogen fertilizer in North America, one of the world's major nitrogen markets.

Strong Operating Performance
We operated our production and distribution assets safely and efficiently throughout 2012. Despite having a heavier than average schedule of turnaround activity, our ammonia plants, in aggregate, operated at 99 percent of rated capacity for the year. Four of our 13 ammonia plants set production records, while nine of our 21 ammonia terminals established individual shipment records. The strong performance of our entire terminal network helped us set an ammonia shipping record for the company.

During the year, we increased gross ammonia capacity at Donaldsonville by 100,000 tons through the elimination of production "bottlenecks." Together, our complexes produced 13 million tons of nitrogen products and 2 million tons of phosphate products and our logistics teams delivered them to customers in an efficient and timely manner through our extensive network of distribution points. Among the challenges our logistics teams faced during 2012 were earlier than anticipated demand during the spring planting and fall application periods and low water levels on the Mississippi River which impeded barge traffic. Using our distribution flexibility, multiple modes of transportation and a considerable amount of ingenuity, our employees succeeded in keeping a steady supply of plant nutrients flowing to our customers. We have a deep commitment to the safety of our employees, neighbors and communities and a vigilant focus on safe operating practices. Our strong safety culture is reflected in a number of safety milestones achieved by our employees during 2012. These include 11 years worked without a lost time accident at our Courtright Nitrogen Complex and 10 safe years worked at our Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex. Our Woodward Nitrogen Complex became the 13th CF Industries site to achieve Star status under the Voluntary Protection Program administered by the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration. Ultimately, the safe return of our employees to their homes and families each day is the most valued outcome of our safety programs.

Platform for Growth
Following two years of concentrated effort by a large dedicated team, our company, as of January 6, 2013, began conducting business using a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and new shipping and logistics software. I commend the efforts of our employees who, working closely with outside consultants, succeeded in moving these very challenging projects across the finish line simultaneously. The transition to these new systems effectively completes our business integration with Terra Industries and provides a platform to support future growth.

Financial Performance and Capital Deployment
The generation of a record $3.3 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) during 2012 attests to the attractiveness of our markets, the strength of our business model and outstanding execution by our team. This enabled us to return cash to shareholders through dividends and value accretive share repurchases, while also investing in growth projects. During the second quarter of 2012, we completed the $1.5 billion share repurchase program we put in place in August 2011. We bought back a total of 9.6 million shares under this program at an average price of $156.80 and completed it in less than one year. Following the completion of that program, our board authorized a new $3.0 billion share repurchase program that extends through December 31, 2016. This program speaks to our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders as a long-term component of our capital allocation strategy. We entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining interests in Canadian Fertilizers Limited, the entity that holds our Medicine Hat, Alberta, production complex, for C$0.9 billion. We own two-thirds of the economic interest in this business and have been proud to operate the facility for the past 35 years. We are working through the regulatory approval process for the acquisition which, when finalized, will provide CF Industries access to an incremental 425,000 gross tons of ammonia and 275,000 tons of urea from existing production, significantly enhancing our ability to serve customers in western Canada and the northern region of the United States. This transaction will provide us sole discretion in governing the complex and marketing its output. We formally announced a $3.8 billion capacity expansion program and it is off to a fast start. The projects in Louisiana and Iowa will increase our marketable nitrogen nutrient volume by more than 25 percent. Our $2.1 billion investment in new ammonia, urea and UAN plants at the Donaldsonville Nitrogen Complex in Louisiana leverages its proximity to the Mississippi River and the Gulf of Mexico. This strategic location will provide considerable flexibility as we market the additional production volume. Our $1.7 billion investment to build new ammonia and urea plants at our Port Neal Nitrogen Complex in Iowa will enable us to serve upper-Midwest customers from a location with a strong transportation cost advantage. The increased nitrogen production

The graph above shows the cumulative total stockholder return, assuming an initial investment of $100 and the reinvestment of any subsequent dividends, for the period beginning on January 1, 2008 and ending on December 31, 2012. The chart tracks our common stock, a peer group, the Dow Jones United States Commodity Chemicals (DJUSCC) Index, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, to which CF Industries Holdings, Inc. common stock was added on August 27, 2008. In constructing our peer group, we have selected Agrium Inc., The Mosaic Company, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. and Intrepid Potash, Inc., all of which are publicly traded manufacturers of agricultural chemical fertilizers with headquarters in North America. We have assumed the initial investment of $100 in the peer group was allocated among them on the basis of their respective market capitalizations at the beginning of the period.

capacity from these projects, which are expected to come online in 2015 and 2016, will enable us to serve our customers better, create more good jobs in our local communities and build additional value for CF Industries' shareholders. We are very pleased to play a leading role in the industrial renaissance under way in the United States -- a renaissance enabled by the application of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, and the resulting increased production of natural gas from shale resources. The United States has a clear advantage over the rest of the world in the production of shale gas, and our role as a North American nitrogen producer has put us in a position to use this U.S. input to increase U.S. supply of nitrogen fertilizers for U.S. farmers. We are proud to help reduce the United States' reliance on imported nitrogen fertilizer products.

Looking Forward
Agricultural market conditions are as favorable today as at any time in recent history and should position CF Industries for another great year in 2013. With the economic incentives in place for U.S. farmers to plant a projected 97 million acres of corn again in 2013, we believe nitrogen fertilizer demand will be at or near record levels. We expect natural gas prices to remain in an attractive range. The exceptional advantages provided by our North American assets have positioned our company well to serve our customers, expand production capacity profitably and generate long-term value for our shareholders. On behalf of your Board of Directors, I thank each of our employees whose dedication, creativity and teamwork produced truly outstanding results in 2012. I am confident in their ability to build on this performance as we capitalize on the significant market and capacity expansion opportunities before us.

Sincerely,

Stephen R. Wilson Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer April 1, 2013
