To Our Shareholders
In fiscal 2016, Atmos Energy continued to pursue its goal of becoming the nation's safest natural gas distributor through significant infrastructure investments.
  We replaced approximately 570 miles of aging natural gas distribution and transmission pipelines to make our system safer and more reliable.   We conducted over 89,000 hours of training for our service, construction and maintenance technicians to prepare them for providing safe service.   We adopted highly advanced technology to help us detect pipeline leaks, and we launched a multi-year information-technology project to manage and document construction for our pipeline modernization program. We also did very well financially:   Reported earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2016 went up 29 cents, or 9.4 percent, to $3.38, marking our 14th consecutive annual increase. Net income for the fiscal year was $350 million, compared to $315 million in fiscal 2015.   Dividends paid in fiscal 2016 were $1.68 per share. In November 2016, the board of directors continued our trend of consecutive annual dividend increases for the 33rd year by raising the indicated rate by 7.1 percent for fiscal 2017 to $1.80 per share.   Total shareholder return in fiscal 2016 was 31 percent.   Our stock closed at $74.47 per share  on September 30, 2016.

 Reducing "regulatory lag" to promptly recover our investments is the result of foresight and focus on our core business. When Chairman of the Board Robert W. Best was CEO, Atmos Energy officials began seeking constructive regulatory outcomes at state legislatures and before public utility commissions. Reducing regulatory lag provides utilities like Atmos Energy the ability to attract funding to modernize our pipeline assets and to maintain stable earnings.
Large Investments, Yet Low

The capital investments we are making to replace, fortify and expand our distribution and transmission pipelines are generating improved safety metrics and excellent financial results. In fiscal year 2016, we invested $1.1 billion of capital, which was a 13 percent increase over fiscal year 2015. Over 80 percent of that spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects; that proportion in fiscal 2017 is expected to be over 80 percent.  Because of balanced rate designs and regulatory mechanisms in the eight states we serve, we begin earning a return on about 95% of our annual capital expenditures within six months of the test year end and 99 percent within 12 months of the test year end.

Customer Bills

Regulatory authorities in the states we serve recognize the critical need to accelerate our capital outlays for replacing aging infrastructure. As a result of their support for implementing innovative rate mechanisms, we are now in a favorable position to continue our pipeline infrastructure program far into the future.  Equally favorable is the effect on our customers' bills. Our customers' monthly bills essentially have stayed flat, with the infrastructure investments being offset by gas prices that have remained very affordable. Customers' bills have averaged less than $60 a month since 2007. We project that our average monthly bill will remain

We are significantly upgrading our infrastructure--with all the incumbent benefits of public safety and reliability of gas deliveries even on the coldest days--while our customers' monthly bills remain affordable.

Atmos Energy's annualized monthly gas bills may, in fact, be one of the lowest costs in the household budget of our average residential customer.
Financial Results

Contributions to fiscal 2016 net income were $232 million from regulated dis-

tribution operations, $102 million from regulated pipeline operations, and $16 million from nonregulated operations. Net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaled $103 million in fiscal 2016, compared to $115 million in fiscal 2015. An additional $15 million of rate requests were filed during fiscal 2016 but were still in various stages of review at the end of the fiscal year.   At September 30, 2016, our balance sheet had a debt-to-capital ratio of 48.5 percent, compared to 47.7 percent as of

the fiscal 2015 year-end. The Company had about $500 million in net liquidity to meet anticipated financial needs.  In early October 2016, we amended an existing $1.25 billion revolving credit agreement, which increased our committed loan facility to $1.5 billion and extended the facility through September 25, 2021 and retained an "accordion" feature, which affords Atmos Energy the opportunity to increase the facility to $1.75 billion.  During the year, our corporate credit

Outlook

Our strategy is to invest in our existing assets rather than to acquire more utility properties. We own more than 75,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipelines, and have 3.1 million service lines to customers' premises.  Our comprehensive infrastructure renewal and modernization program allows us to remove cast iron and bare steel pipe and replace or fortify older coated steel pipelines and early vintage plastic pipe.  We have replaced nearly 1,000 miles of cast iron, bare steel and early-generation plastic pipe since 2010, and we expect to double our replacement mileage during the next five years.  Our capital spending for fiscal 2017 is forecast to be between $1.1 billion and $1.25 billion. We expect our annual capital expenditures through fiscal 2020 will be about $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion.  Our total rate base of regulated assets is

expected to grow from approximately $5.9 billion at the end of fiscal $74.47 2016 to between $8.5 2016 billion and $9.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 at an annual rate of between 9 percent and 10 percent. Accordingly, we project that earnings per diluted share will increase at an annual growth rate of between 6 percent and 8 percent, with a total annual return to shareholders ranging between 9 percent and 11 percent through fiscal 2020.  Our previously announced guidance for earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2017 ranges between $3.45 and $3.65. Net income from continuing operations is forecast to be between $365 million and $390 million.
Leadership Update

Atmos Energy is pleased that two additional distinguished leaders have joined our Board of Directors.  In March 2016, Rafael G. Garza was named to our board. He is a co-founder and managing director of Bravo Equity. Since 1989, Mr. Garza has worked almost exclusively on U.S./Mexico businesses, specifically those benefiting from the U.S. Hispanic market. Mr. Garza has been a frequent speaker at forums addressing U.S. Hispanic growth and U.S./ Mexico relations.  Prior to founding Bravo Equity (and its predecessor firm, RGG Capital Partners),

Mr. Garza was country manager of Ernst & Young's Corporate Finance Unit in Mexico, where he assisted some 100 companies with investment transactions. Based in Mexico City from 1996 to 2000, he specialized in investment advisory services, including private debt and equity transactions, mergers and acquisitions, restructurings, privatizations, and strategic financial planning.  Effective November 1, 2016, Kelly H. Compton joined our board. Since 1992, Ms. Compton has served as the executive director of The Hoglund Foundation and is responsible for the management and oversight of all areas of operations.  Before joining the foundation, Ms. Compton was with NationsBank Texas and its predecessors for 13 years. She was vice president of commercial lending, with responsibility for marketing and loan administration for middle market companies in the Dallas area.  These leaders are supported by our 4,700 employees, who are committed to serving our customers exceptionally well while ensuring safety for themselves, their fellow employees and the people in the 1,400 communities we serve. On our continued journey to becoming the safest natural gas company, we have the right people in place, getting the right results the right way.
