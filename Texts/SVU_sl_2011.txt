Dear SUPERVALU Stockholders,
Fiscal 2011 was a year of transition for SUPERVALU. We made significant changes to further leverage our scale and improve operational agility as we continue our journey to become “America’s Neighborhood Grocer.”
This year’s results were disappointing and reflect our extended timeline for enhancing our fresh offering, sharpening retail pricing and redirecting SUPERVALU’s focus on hyperlocal retailing. Adjusted earnings for the year were $296 million on sales of $37.5 billion and identical store sales fell by six percent.
Fiscal 2011 was a pivotal year in which we made a number of important structural changes and accomplished several noteworthy objectives:
• Aligned Merchandising and Procurement Teams. We placed a single leader over our merchandising and logistics functions to improve coordination and realize procurement efficiencies throughout the organization. This alignment allows SUPERVALU to streamline interactions with vendor partners and leverage the procurement capacity of our 1,114 traditional stores and the 2,700 retail affiliate stores we serve through our wholesale business.
• Monetized Non-Core Assets. We shed non-core assets with the sale of retail stores in Connecticut and Cincinnati, our Bristol Farms banner and Total Logistic Control. These moves allow us to hone our resources on core retail banners and provided incremental capital to retire corporate debt.
• Accelerated Debt Pay Down. We reduced total debt by approximately $885 million in fiscal 2011, exceeding our initial target by more than $280 million, and successfully extended a portion of our revolving credit facility by five years. Since the Albertson’s acquisition in 2006, SUPERVALU has reduced total debt by more than $2.75 billion.
• Expanded Save-A-Lot. We opened 142 new hard-discount Save-A-Lot stores, including ten co-branded locations operated by Rite-Aid and six Hispanic-oriented stores in Texas. Fiscal 2011 marks the first year since 2005 that Save-A-Lot has meaningfully grown its retail store count. The company remains on track to double Save-A-Lot’s footprint to 2,400 locations by the end of fiscal 2015.
• Solidified Independent Business. We improved productivity across the Supply Chain network and affiliated notable new business. This helped to offset volume lost due to a national retail customer’s transition of certain volume to self-distribution, the acquisition of a sizable customer by a competitor and other normal attrition. Our introduction of new automation technology – including a facility in Lancaster, PA which became fully operational this year – is also delivering productivity above expected levels.
• Realized Significant Cost Savings. SUPERVALU removed $175 million from its cost structure through the consolidation of administrative functions, procurement efficiencies and facilities management.
Perhaps the most important development of the past year was the formalization of SUPERVALU’s business transformation initiative. A detailed plan was developed in fiscal 2011 that will make our everyday, non- promoted prices more competitive, improve our retail execution and allow our store directors flexibility to tailor their stores to the unique needs of their neighborhoods. At the core of this transformation is a change to
 
our retail price architecture, which will ensure that SUPERVALU’s retail banners provide fair everyday pricing in addition to the promotions for which we are known.
We began rolling out several components of this plan late last year and will spend much of fiscal 2012 improving our retail pricing, promotional effectiveness, in-stock position, store operations and retail shrink. Funding from our transformative programs has already been identified and I am encouraged with the progress we have made to date.
Looking forward to fiscal 2012, we are acting with a sense of urgency to improve sales and drive returns for our shareholders as we execute our business transformation. At our core, we are a service-oriented company and an early barometer for our progress will be the passion and dedication that our 140,000 associates display in responding to the local needs of the communities we serve.
Having taken a full inventory of our operations, evaluated our market position and realigned our businesses to better harness the scale of our retail and wholesale operations, I am optimistic that SUPERVALU enters fiscal 2012 with the leadership and capabilities to fully address the competitive and operational issues that have acted as headwinds in recent years.
