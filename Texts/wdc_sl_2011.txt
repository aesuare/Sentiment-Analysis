 John F. Coyne, President and Chief Executive Officer
Fellow Shareholders:
Fiscal 2011 was a tough year in the hard drive industry with the PC and HDD industries growth rates slowing off the unexpectedly strong post recession year of 2010. The slowdown was driven by a marked drop in consumer spending and increased competition for share of consumer spending from devices like smartphones and tablets. The result was a challenging pricing environment
for hard drives.
The HDD industry grew fiscal 2011 volumes 4% to 657 million units, while WD again grew faster than the industry at 6%, shipping 207 million hard drives for the year — a 1% share gain. This reaffirms customer preference for WD’s value proposition
of providing a reliable supply of high quality storage solutions at a competitive price with superior customer service. Revenue declined year-over-year, reflecting the challenging pricing environment amid slower demand in both the consumer and commercial industry sectors.
Our business continued to be a consistent generator of cash
in fiscal 2011. We further strengthened our balance sheet and continued to make critical investments in technologies and infrastructure to support our industry leadership position, to drive market expansion in our existing businesses as well as in our newer market entries like traditional enterprise and the digital connected home. We exited the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $3.5 billion.

We believe there are a number of reasons why the next few years could be a stronger period for the industry and for WD because of:
• the potential for an acceleration of the commercial

 reinvestment cycle;
• the potential for better consumer confidence translating into stronger discretionary spending;
• the planned launch of redesigned, feature-rich PCs enabled by Windows® 8; and
• our continued favorable standing with customers as one of the preferred suppliers of the world’s most cost–effective storage solutions for the massive amounts of content being generated on the client and in the cloud.
In this context, it’s important to consider some history. Through-
out fiscal 2011, we operated close to the bottom of our business
model range. Others in the industry struggled even more,
reporting results below their published models. Historical cycles
show that prolonged periods of below-model performance are
typically followed by a return to business model parameters as

   On the other hand, with the industry’s lowest cost structure and a demonstrated ability to adjust our operations quickly and adroitly to changing market conditions, we are prepared to deal with a slower growth environment if this comes to pass.
Our focus on excellence in operations, flexibility and execution has been key to our success. In fiscal 2011, the WD team and our suppliers performed well as we navigated through the supply

accelerate innovation. Upon completion of the transaction, we will have a stronger position in the traditional enterprise market, an improved solid-state drive lineup and further cost advantage. We are working closely with the regulatory agencies to obtain approval of the acquisition and subject to those approvals, we believe we will close the transaction by the end of calendar 2011.
In closing, I want to thank our customers for their loyalty. We will continue to work diligently to earn their business on an ongoing basis. I also want to thank our suppliers for their support and our employees for their passion and unfailing commitment. I look forward to keeping you informed of our progress in the months ahead in fiscal 2012.
