Cclearly, 2009 was one of the most difficult, For the 85th consecutive year, we paid shareholders cash
and yet, one of the more rewarding years for sonoco. Thecontinuationofthedeepestglobalrecession in decades significantly impacted volumes Companywide, particularly in our businesses which serve industrial markets.
In response, we moved quickly to lean our business by sizing our manufacturing
dividends, which for the year totaled $1.08 per share. CombinedwiththeappreciationofSonoco’sstockprice,share- holders received a 32.3% total return in 2009, which exceeded most major equity indices.
Despite extremely tough global economic conditions, our management and employees kept their focus on improving what we can control. We improved customer service—using what we call the perfect order—by maximizing on-time ship- ments, accurately filling and invoicing orders, and providing top-quality products. Our employees remained focused on safety, reducing recordable injuries 23% and achieving another record low total incident rate, or TIR, of .55.
Summary of 2009 results
Sonoco’s sales declined, down 13% from 2008 levels, to $3.6 billion. Volumes declined throughout the Company, but most notably in our industrial-focused businesses. Sales were also negatively impacted by declining selling prices, again pri- marily in our more recession-sensitive Tubes and Cores/Paper segment, resulting from lower raw material and other input costs. These declines more than offset price increases in our Consumer Packaging segment that were put in place to coun- teract higher material and other costs. The stronger dollar dur- ing much of the year also reduced total sales by $138 million.
Earnings were $151.5 million ($1.50 per diluted share), com- pared with $164.6 million ($1.63 per diluted share) in 2008. Earnings in 2009 were negatively impacted by after-tax restruc- turing charges of $23 million and a $5.3 million charge related to a retrospective tax law change in Mexico. 2008 earnings were negatively impacted by a $31 million, after-tax, noncash impairment charge related to the Company’s remaining inter- est in the sale of its high density film business and $30.8 million in after-tax asset impairment and restructuring charges.
Base earnings were $179.8 million ($1.78 per diluted share), compared with $226.4 million ($2.24 per diluted share) in 2008. This 21% decline was primarily due to lower Company- wide volumes and increased pension costs of $33 million, after tax. These items were partially offset by strong productivity

Our successful
strategy to grow our businesses serving consumer markets resulted in record operating profits in our Consumer Packaging segment and record new product sales. While operating profits from our Tubes and Cores/Paper segment declined nearly 50% year over year, we did see sequential improvement in volumes during the second half of the year, and our restructuring actions and productivity initiatives helped strengthen results.
Cash flow from operations was extremely strong, helped by our efforts to aggressively manage working capital. We improved the financial fitness of the Company by paying down $116 million of debt and making a voluntary $100 million con- tribution to fund our U.S. pension plan. As a result, Sonoco enters 2010 in one of its strongest financial positions in our history.

and a favorable price/cost relation-
ship. The net impact of these factors
pushed our gross profit margin to
18.5%, the highest level reached since
2007, and an increase from 17.6% in
2008. (Information about base earn-
ings and base earnings per diluted
share along with reconciliations to

financial measure is provided on pages 18-19 of the Form 10-K contained within this report.)
Despite a $100 million voluntary pension contribution, cash generated from operations was the third highest in Company history at $391 million, exceeding the $379.4 million generated in 2008. Without the pension contribution, cash flow would have been near a record, due primarily to our efforts to effec- tively manage inventories and other elements of working capi- tal. Cash flow from operating activities was used to pay down debt, fund capital expenditures of $104.2 million and return $107.9 million to shareholders through dividends.
At year end, total debt was $581 million, compared with $690 million at the end of 2008. The Company’s debt-to-total- capital ratio declined to 29.6% at year end, compared with 37% at the end of 2008. We maintain a strong liquidity position, as cash on hand increased year over year by $84 million to a total of $185 million. We also had no borrowings outstanding under the Company’s $500 million commercial paper program, which is fully supported by a bank credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks committed until

mature industrial businesses. This strategy continues to show remark- able success as our Consumer Packaging segment achieved record operating profits of $170 million, up 30% from 2008. Our profit growth momentum has continued with this segment reporting eight consecu- tive quarters of year-over-year improvement.
Sales generated by our diverse consumer packaging and ser- vices businesses were about 58% of the Company’s total sales this year, as compared with 54% in 2008. In 2000, approxi- mately 54% of our sales were from industrial markets, compared with 46% from consumer markets. As a result of our strategy during the decade, we have grown consumer-related sales by more than 80%, while operating profits from these businesses increased by about 90%, excluding the impact of pension costs. We believe that sales from our consumer-focused businesses will likely reach more than 60% of total sales by 2012, although we still expect to grow sales from our global industrial markets.
In 2009, we streamlined our consumer organization, com- bining nine separate divisions into four global business units. To continue growing these businesses, we are focused on improving our total solutions offering to consumer product companies by providing the industry’s most complete portfolio of packaging and supply chain services, ranging from product creation to reclamation.
To complement our total solutions effort, we provide “one face” of senior account leadership to coordi-

Industrial markets slowly rebounding
The global recession significantly impacted our industrial volumes in 2009, which together with lower selling prices and unfavorable exchange rates, resulted in sales in our Tubes and Cores/Paper segment declining 20%. While volumes were down sharply in the first half, we began to see stabilization in the third quarter, and fourth quarter volumes showed improve- ment over weak fourth quarter 2008 levels.
    sales also come from our Corporate
Customers. In2009,wesetanimpres-
sive record by generating more than
$179 million in new product sales, up
31% from last year. New consumer-related products accounted for $162 million of this total, which was up 39% from last year. We launched a number of new rigid paper, rigid plastic, flexible packaging and ends and closure products in 2009. The intro- duction of Kraft Foods’ Maxwell House coffee in Sonoco’s high- performance composite can illustrated our ability to collabo- rate with our Corporate Customers to develop “game chang- ing” packaging alternatives. (A more detailed case study of this impressive effort is found on pages 9-11.)
Unfortunately, declining volumes necessitated the closure of a paper mill in the United States, five tube and core plants— three in the United States, one in Europe and one in Canada— and a wooden reel facility. To improve efficiency, we also streamlined our 10 industrial products divisions into two busi- ness units—North American Converted Products, which includes all of our industrial carrier businesses; and the Primary Materials Group, which includes our paperboard mills, internal supply operations and recycling. Our European, South American and Asian paperboard, recycling and industrial con- verted products businesses continue to report to regional gen- eral managers.
Changes in the global marketplace led us to modify our industrial strategy and take steps necessary to make this busi- ness a stronger cash generator while pursuing opportunities to grow in new geographies and markets. Although we already have low-cost operations, we have begun implementing an operational excellence initiative aimed at assuring that we have the most efficient operations in our industry.
We expect that our base tubes and cores business will per- forminlinewiththegeneraleconomy,withgrowthcoming from investments in markets in South America, Eastern Europe and Asia. In addition, we continue to look for acquisi- tion opportunities to rationalize operations in more mature markets, particularly in North America and Europe.

  Approximately 74% of our consumer packaging and ser- vices sales occurred in the United States. However, we are tar- geting international sales growth, particularly in our Packaging Services business.

We expect sales demand to remain near the levels experienced during the second half of 2009, which
would lead to favorable year-over-year comparisons for the first half of 2010, particularly in our recovering industrial businesses. We also expect continued improvements in productivity, and our restructuring actions and other cost-control measures will aid results and position us well for a continued economic recov- ery. Further helping us in 2010 will be decreased pension expenses as a result of our $100 million voluntary contribution and a strong 2009 investment performance.

packaging company was recognized.
With the September launch of our True BlueTM line of sustainable packaging, we are setting a new standard for more environmentally responsible packaging. (Read more about this on pages 12-13.) Also, for the first time, we were listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Sonoco is one of only
nesses. The rebound from the recession will likely be less robust than in past recoveries. Prices are likely to continue to be vola- tile. For example, the cost of recovered paper, our primary raw material, has doubled since November 2009, which is forcing us to implement price increases with our customers and may pres- sure margins. We effectively navigated the depths of the reces- sion and have successfully dealt with rising raw material costs before. We are confident in our ability to manage through the challenges 2010 has in store and to deliver another year of strong performance for all our stakeholders.
Thank you for your continued support and for entrusting us with your investment.
