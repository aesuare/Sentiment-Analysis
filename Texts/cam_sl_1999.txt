taking advantage of opportunities in the coming recovery.

To the Stockholders of Cooper Cameron
This was a difficult year. It began with extremely low oil prices, economic uncertainty in Southeast Asia and concern about the global market environment. Our orders and backlog had begun to decline during the last half of 1998, and the weakness in our customers' spending and activity levels continued throughout 1999. Even though crude oil prices were bolstered earlier in the year by a combination of worldwide economic stabilization and agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC energy producers on lower production levels, the damage to our customers was done. Most of them have been hesitant, or in some cases fiscally unable, to resume the spending pace of only a couple of years ago. In this letter last year, we discussed the need to manage our

Downsizing necessary to respond to market

costs effectively, so as to ensure that we would comfortably
survive any downturn in our business. We also said we needed to be mindful of being even better prepared to take advantage of the inevitable recovery when it arrived. We have done both.

Financial performance in a trying environment

Revenues totaled $1.46 billion in 1999, down about 22 percent from 1998's $1.88 billion. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell by 40 percent, to $193 million compared with last year's $323 million. Earnings per share, excluding nonrecurring items, totaled $1.00 for the year, down 64 percent from 1998. The good news? We posted these results in a market where many of the companies in our industry lost money or struggled to remain modestly in the black. This performance reflects the benefit of having a backlog of business and is a tribute to our employees' ability to take decisive action to deal with tough issues. We expect to be just as resourceful in

At the beginning of 1999, our employment totaled approximately 9,300, down from a peak of nearly 10,400 in early 1998. Declining revenues, lower utilization and plant consolidations triggered additional reductions during the year, and nearly 1,000 people moved to Rolls-Royce plc as a result of the sale of our rotating compressor business. By the end of 1999, through layoffs, retirements, attrition and the sale, we had reduced staffing by more than twenty percent. Our employment level at year-end­approximately 7,200­was below that of the end of 1995, our first year as a public company. Plant closures address capacity, cost structure--In early 1999, we completed the closing of a Cooper Cameron Valves (CCV) plant near Houston, Texas, and moved the operations to facilities in Oklahoma City. Cameron's Vienna, Austria plant was closed in the third quarter of 1999, and its manufacturing load was transferred to other European facilities. We have initiated the closing of Cooper Energy Services' (CES) Grove City, Pennsylvania facility, which should be completed by the second quarter of 2000, and the castings and parts previously provided by this facility will be purchased from outside suppliers or produced at other locations. Certain CES facilities in Mount Vernon, Ohio--separate from those conveyed to Rolls-Royce in the sale of the rotating business--are being closed and their operations will be transferred to Cooper Cameron locations in Oklahoma and Texas. All of the above actions reflect not only softer markets and declining orders in these businesses, but also opportunities to generate continuing cost savings.
Sale of rotating business provides multiple benefits

At the end of the third quarter, we closed on the sale of the CES rotating, or centrifugal, compressor business to our long-time joint

venture partner, Rolls-Royce plc, for approximately $200 million. Our difficulties in the rotating market stemmed from the fact that we did not control the key technology of the business (the engine, which Rolls-Royce provides). We competed in a relatively narrow, highly competitive market niche and had limited opportunity for aftermarket parts and service as a manufacturer solely of power turbines and compressor units. We expect that RollsRoyce will be able to leverage its worldwide exposure and full ownership of these facilities into improved profitability and utilization. They were excellent partners, and we wish them well. CES' resources will now be devoted to the manufacture, sale and servicing of reciprocating engines and compressors, which are used primarily in natural gas markets. We are encouraged by the impact to date of the costsaving steps that have already been initiated within the CES organization, the potential that exists in an improving North American gas market and the opportunity to build on CES' role as a supplier to equipment leasing companies. Another benefit is the flexibility that the cash proceeds from the sale added to our financial position. CES' transformation to meaningful profitability is by no means complete. There are still issues related to cost structure, product lines and aftermarket exposure that we will address in the coming months. The ongoing relocation of facilities under the terms of the agreement with Rolls-Royce is a significant part of that process, but should be completed by the end of this year.
Financial flexibility, business options enhanced

We have taken great pains to ensure that our balance sheet remains in solid condition.

During this market cycle, we have taken great pains to ensure that our balance sheet remains in solid condition. The cash infusion from the rotating sale further enhances our financial flexibility and expands our options for improving performance as the industry recovers. Even as orders and profits declined, the cash generation capability of our businesses has enabled us to achieve a very low

debt level. At year-end, after using approximately $92 million to repurchase our stock under the bank transactions described below, we had only $210 million of debt, with a debtto-capitalization ratio at less than 23 percent. Beginning in early 1998, two of our banks periodically bought Cooper Cameron common stock in the market under a forward purchase agreement and held it for us. Under the agreement, we had the right to buy the stock from them at the price they paid in the market, plus a fee. During December 1999, we bought from the banks all 3.5 million shares that had been purchased to date and added those to our treasury stock. The shares were acquired at an average price of about $28, including fees. The immediate impact is a reduction in the total shares outstanding, and therefore an effective increase in the earnings per share that will be reported in subsequent periods. We expect to gradually reissue the shares in the future for internal needs, such as compensation programs, and we also retain the ability to repurchase shares in the market. Our preference at this time is to keep our actual share count very near the fifty million shares (adjusted for the 1997 split) that were outstanding upon our creation in 1995. Our total authorization for repurchase is ten million shares, or nearly twenty percent of the shares outstanding. Acquisitions remain a priority for us. Although we made only one during 1999-- buying out the interest of our joint venture partner in Venezuela--our assessment process remains active. At any time, we are likely to be reviewing two or three candidates for addition to the Cooper Cameron portfolio. Our criteria remain the same as always: we prefer businesses we already know well; private firms can usually be acquired without paying the market premium inherent in buying public companies; regional players usually offer the chance to develop or expand a meaningful market share position; and we like the margins and long-term nature of aftermarket businesses. Our current financial position will allow us the luxury of considering numerous possibilities that meet all or most of these standards.

Patent Applications Filed $115

For years, Cooper Cameron's businesses have been among the leaders in developing new products and processes for their industries. Since Cooper Cameron's formation in 1995, we have placed greater emphasis on the translation of ideas into patents. As a result, intellectual property activity has increased significantly, both in alliances with other companies and through internal programs. Our employees can earn incentive awards for the successful development of patentable concepts that contribute to revenues and profitability, or that can be licensed to the industry. The number of Cooper Cameron patent applications has increased significantly since 1995-96; filings during 1999 were more than double those of recent years. Protecting the intellectual property assets inherent in many of our proprietary core technologies and business methods is important to improving competitive position and product margins. The SpoolTreeTM Production System is one example of an innovative solution that became a Cameron patent and is now an accepted application for subsea completions. Licensing revenues from such technical innovations are expected to increase in coming years.
Prepared for the recovery

world, the actions described above have kept our revenue-generating capacity at least at the levels we saw in the robust markets of late 1997. We believe we have seen the trough in the recent cycle; now, we are anxious to see how much better we can do when given the chance to again perform in a strengthening market.

Capital Expenditures

We anticipate that this new equipment will give us greater manufacturing capacity at lower cost when activity recovers. That should translate into higher profit margins, better on-time delivery performance, and greater customer satisfaction.

In the rising markets of 1997-98, we began allocating capital to upgrade manufacturing plants to accommodate customers' needs for quicker delivery. We followed through with those plans, even as orders and backlog were declining. Over the past three years, two-thirds of our spending has been directed toward improving Cameron's facilities. Newer, faster, more efficient machines have lowered our costs in the downturn of the business cycle. More importantly, we anticipate that this new equipment will give us greater manufacturing capacity at lower cost when activity recovers. That should translate into higher profit margins, better on-time delivery performance, and greater customer satisfaction. The bottom line? While we've closed or consolidated several facilities around the

A couple of changes in our management team deserve mention. William C. Lemmer joined us in July as vice president, general counsel and secretary of Cooper Cameron Corporation, responsible for all legal matters with respect to Cooper Cameron and its subsidiaries. Bill previously held similar positions with Oryx Energy Company and with Sunoco, Inc. His diverse experience in the energy business makes him a valuable addition to our senior management team. Bill replaced Franklin Myers, who continued to serve as corporate general counsel even after he was named president of our Cooper Energy Services division in August 1998. Franklin's full attention is now devoted to managing the day-to-day CES operations. E. Fred Minter has announced his retirement from Cooper Turbocompressor (CTC) after 42 years with CTC and its predecessors. Under Fred's leadership as president, CTC has been a top performer in the industry and in the Cooper Cameron family. His successor, Robert J. Rajeski, became president of CTC in August, and Fred has served in an advisory and consulting role since then. His forthright manner and steady hand will be missed; we are grateful for his exemplary service and we wish him a long and rewarding retirement.

Like us, our customers have taken significant steps to deal with adversity and prepare for recovery. Most of them have struggled through this latest down cycle in our business, and are at least as eager as we for times to improve. Once their cash flows have stabilized and their project economics justify reinvestment, increased activity and spending will drive improving returns for those of us in the

service and equipment businesses. We've done our best to maintain our relationships with customers during difficult periods. I think those relationships will be a huge part of our success over the next couple of years. Much of that success will be driven by the apparent growth in worldwide deepwater development. Significant opportunities exist for our subsea business to rebuild backlog as new orders are placed for production equipment on large-scale offshore projects in areas like West Africa, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico. Plaudits about the importance of people to our business bear little credibility with those who have been downsized, outsourced or otherwise released from their jobs. But the harsh reality is that energy markets are inherently cyclical, and no company can avoid the need to constantly adjust employment--up or down--as the market dictates. The people who work for Cooper Cameron are among the best in their fields; we look forward to

again dealing with the challenges of finding and adding more top performers, as opposed to the difficult task of reducing the workforce because a lack of activity demands it. Let's hope that the current environment develops into the wealth of opportunity that forecasters are touting, and that we can capture the opportunity--and distribute the resulting financial rewards--among all of our constituencies.

Sincerely,

Sheldon R. Erikson
Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer
