To Our Shareholders:
2004 was a great year in every area of our business and we were very pleased with the results. Our global team has delivered strong financial performance for our shareholders and made tremendous progress in advancing our business model in every industry segment and in every region of the world. We are excited about the prospects for further growth and we believe we are well positioned for 2005.
For The Year 2004:
For 2004, total revenue for the Company was $5.7 billion, an increase of $3.0 billion, or 112%, versus 2003. The revenue increase was a result of both growth in volume and increased prices. Diluted earnings per share increased by 23% from $0.99 to $1.22. The per share results have been adjusted to reflect the two- for-one stock split that became effective February 1, 2005. Our excellent 2004 performance propels World Fuel Services into 2005 with strong business momentum.
Financial Strengths:
The Company is anchored by a solid balance sheet. At December 31, 2004, our cash balance was $64 million, with working capital of $181 million and shareholders’ equity of $189 million. Assets managed by the Company exceeded $712 million. In September of 2004, our $100 million revolving credit facility was increased to $150 million and the syndicate now includes LaSalle Bank, HSBC,
Merrill Lynch, JPMorganChase, Israeli Discount Bank, Commercebank N.A., Regions Bank and the International Bank of Miami.
Marine Business:
The results for our marine segment improved significantly in 2004 reflecting increased volume and improved margins across all mar- ket segments. A strong supply position, new account acquisition and a healthy operating environment for the shipping industry all contributed to the strong result. The acquisition of the Tramp Group of companies represented a major success and the finan- cial and commercial integration of Tramp is yielding good results. We reorganized our global marine management team in an effort to put our key commercial leaders in a position to better drive the overall commercial result. They have demonstrated great leader- ship and stepped up our global marketing which has been success- ful in securing a number of new accounts as well as new volume from existing accounts in the United States, Europe and the Far East. Our supply specialization initiative has enabled us to consoli- date our purchasing in a number of major markets and strengthen our supply relationships. The shipping industry reported record results in 2004 and the prospects are good for a strong market in the near term. In 2005, we will be focused on execution and con- tinued improvement in our service offering. Spot and contract pur- chasing, port arbitrage, forward purchasing, fuel quality control,

In our aviation segment, 2004 was a year of continued success

Our largest cen- ters of a10c00tivity—the United States, United 10K00 ingdom, and Singapore—all posted strong results and we were pleased to see better-than50-0expected results from our smaller sa5t0e0 llite offices in Colombia and Russia. After eight years of developing our position

On the services and logistics front, we continue to refine and develop our business model in fuel management and expect growth in this area in 2005. Our overall volume has grown as we continue to demonstrate our ability to add value to our supply and purchasing partners in a growing number of key markets. With the continuing changes in the industry, our supply partners are work- ing with us more closely to aggregate demand, de-risk their port- folios and enhance their global marketing. This has significantly raised our profile with the purchasing community. In the most recent Armbrust survey of 71 global airlines, World Fuel Services was ranked the best regional jet fuel marketer in North America. Our team achieved high marks for best staff, best organizational structure, most innovative, best informed and most improved. This public validation of our service offering is a much deserved trib- ute to our global team and what they have done to firmly establish
and our alliance with Jeppesen has resulted in over 500 new fuel
customers. We have achieved global acceptance of our brand and

firmly established World Fuel Services as the leading fuel solutions
provider for general aviation.
55 Accounting Changes/Sarbanes-Oxley:
Our greatest challenge in 2004 had nothing to do with our busi- ness strategy or the commercial operating environment, but
director of our newest office is the former director of fuel procure- ment for Air China and is highly regarded in the international avia- tion community. We have learned from our marine business that having local representation in China is important to the business model and we are excited about the prospects for growth in this enormous emerging market.

rather with account’i0ng3protoc’o0l 4and Section 40’403of Sarba’n0e4s- Oxley. In March and May of 2005, we announced that the Company’s historical financial statements would need to be restated and that as a result of such restatement management would conclude that the Company had three material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting. The restatement and associated material weaknesses were directly attributable to three required changes in our accounting. The first of these changes related to the timing of when we recognize revenue. As a result of this change, sales and sales-related costs will be recorded based on the date fuel or related services are delivered, as opposed to the date related documentation is received from our third party service providers as had been our prior practice. This will require us to make estimates going forward. The second change related to how we account for inventory derivatives. Under the changed protocol, unrealized gains and losses relating to inventory derivatives will be recorded in the statements of income as opposed to the balance sheet. These unrealized gains or losses will ultimately be offset with the profit or loss on prod- uct sales in future periods. The third and last change related to the presentation of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility in the statement of cash flows. As a result of this

 change, such borrowings and repayments will be presented on a gross rather than net basis. Although no company ever expects or wishes to have to restate their financials, these restatements did not have a significant impact on our overall results for the restated periods. In fact, our business is stronger than ever, and, notwith- standing the restatements, the Company still reported record rev- enues and earnings in 2004. That being said, the Company and its entire management team are committed to our financial statements being fully GAAP compliant and to ensuring that our investors have confidence in the financial information we provide.
This has been an expensive, time consuming process and the ded- ication and commitment of our employees during a challenging process is nothing short of distinctive and we applaud their efforts. The costs of Sarbanes-Oxley have been substantial and will continue to be so going forward. It is simply, the new reality. And while we certainly aspire to be a “best-in-class” company in our internal controls over financial reporting, it is our hope that the exercise will also help us make genuine improvements in our business process across the board. To be meaningful, best prac- tices, transparency and commitment to good process and control must be more than a matter of regulatory compliance and static measurement. They must be an integral part of our corporate cul- ture and animate behavior at every level of the enterprise. For all the costs incurred—both money and distraction—we believe we are a better company today than when we started the process and it will ultimately prove to be a competitive differentiator in the market. And the ultimate promise of Sarbanes-Oxley is the prospect of a living process in which good governance and finan- cial controls help create commercial opportunity and competitive differentiation in the global market.
Future Outlook:
Looking ahead, we expect continued growth in our core aviation and marine businesses and we are looking to expand our service offering into the land based diesel and gasoline markets. A small pilot program launched two years ago is beginning to show prom- ise as a new area in which to provide our specialized expertise to large distributors known as “jobbers” challenged by the same issues faced by our customers in the marine and aviation industries,
including credit, logistics, supply and price risk management. Suppliers, who are increasingly focused on the upstream market and looking to rationalize their participation in the retail market, have welcomed us into the space. We represent a reliable counter- party with a strong marketing and customer facing network which can help optimize their distribution program and reduce expo- sure. Initial market response to our offering has been quite posi- tive and we will spend 2005 focusing on further developing supply relationships and refining our offering to select customers in key markets. While the impact of the land initiative on earnings is immaterial at this time, we believe it could become a meaningful contributor over the next few years.
2004 was a break out year across the board for the Company. We have further secured our strategic position in the market while delivering solid growth in earnings and strong stock performance for our shareholders. In their January 10, 2005 issue, we were recognized by Forbes magazine as one of the best managed com- panies in America, and in their March 7, 2005 issue, Fortune mag- azine included us in their list of America’s most admired companies. We are proud of what our team has achieved. And as we move for- ward, we will continue to focus on solid execution to protect and expand our position into the future.
We thank you, our shareholders, for your continued support.
