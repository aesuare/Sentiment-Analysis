Launching CareFusion
To Cardinal Health Shareholders:
It is hard to believe that it has only been a year since we announced plans to spin off our clinical and medical products businesses as a separate, publicly traded company, now known as CareFusion Corporation. With the spinoff complete, both Cardinal Health and CareFusion are better positioned to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in their respective segments of a very dynamic healthcare industry.
Both companies will enjoy increased focus and flexibility to manage their businesses and investments as necessary to compete effectively. And flexibility is a critical attribute for any company operating in the current environment.
Cardinal Health is focused on the opportunity to improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare, through improving efficiency across the system. CareFusion is focused on improving safety through reducing medication errors and healthcare-acquired infections. Both will go to market with industry- leading products and services and solid teams ready to execute on their business initiatives.
I believe the spinoff is a positive progression for our businesses and our shareholders, many of whom remain shareholders of CareFusion. And I look forward to tracking the progress and success of both businesses in the future.
Sincerely,
R. Kerry Clark
Retired Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
