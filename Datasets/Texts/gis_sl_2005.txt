T o Our Shareholders

Steve Sanger
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer

Fiscal 2005 was a successful year for General Mills in several key respects: · Our net sales grew 2 percent to exceed $11.2 billion worldwide. · Net earnings rose 18 percent to exceed $1.2 billion. This included a gain of $284 million after tax from two businesses divested during 2005 ­ these were our 40.5 percent interest in Snack Ventures Europe (SVE) and the Lloyd's barbecue business. That gain was partially offset by expenses of $87 million after tax associated with debt repurchases. · Diluted earnings per share (EPS) grew to $3.08, up 18 percent from $2.60 in 2004. These earnings per share figures reflect our adoption of a new accounting standard for contingently convertible debt, which reduced reported EPS in both years.

2005 Operating Results
Net sales for our largest business segment, U.S. Retail, totaled $7 .8 billion, which essentially matched the prior year's 53-week results. Unit volume grew overall, with five of our six major product divisions recording gains. Big G cereals was the exception ­ volume for this business was down 3 percent on a comparable 52-week basis due to reduced levels of price discounting and merchandising in the second half of the year. Total U.S. Retail volume was up 3 percent on a comparable-weeks basis led by Yoplait yogurt and Snacks. Operating profits declined 5 percent, as this volume growth and productivity savings did not offset the effects of unfavorable sales mix, higher ingredient and fuel costs, and higher promotional expense.

For our Bakeries and Foodservice business segment, second-half operating profits grew 27 percent. That solid finish enabled the division to meet its goal · We generated strong cash flows in 2005 that of stabilizing annual profits after a decline in 2004. enabled us to pay down $2 billion of our debt, pay Net sales totaled $1.7 billion, essentially in line with out increased shareholder dividends and invest prior-year results. $434 million in capital to support future growth.

We also recorded a strong profit increase from jointventure operations. In total, earnings from joint ventures grew 20 percent to reach $89 million after tax. And that includes just nine months of earnings from the SVE joint venture, which ended in February 2005 when our interest was redeemed.

that debt-reduction goal a year ahead of schedule. This debt paydown has improved key financial ratios such as fixed charge coverage and cash flow to debt. In addition, our interest expense fell10 percent in 2005, and we expect it to be down further in 2006. While we focused a significant portion of our cash flow on reducing debt, we also increased shareholder dividends. Dividends paid in 2005 totaled $1.24 per share, a 13 percent increase from the prior rate. Recently, the board of directors authorized a further 6 percent increase in the dividend, to a new annualized rate of $1.32, effective with the Aug. 1, 2005, quarterly payment. General Mills and its predecessor firm now have paid dividends without interruption or reduction for 107 years.

Financial Highlights
During 2005, we took actions that significantly strengthened our balance sheet and improved our financial flexibility. Following our acquisition of Pillsbury in fiscal 2002, our debt balance exceeded $9 billion. We set a goal of reducing our debt to $7 billion by the end of 2006. Thanks to strong cash flow generated in 2005 ­ plus the added cash we received from divesting SVE and Lloyd's ­ we met

We believe this financial performance, together with an attractive dividend yield, should result in consistent, double-digit returns to our shareholders. Our 2006 goals include a target of low single-digit growth in net sales, helped by some carryover benefit from pricing actions taken in 2005. We expect segment operating profits to grow at a mid singledigit rate, outpacing sales growth due in part to productivity savings.

Product innovation is key to our growth. We've got a strong lineup of new products coming across all of our businesses in 2006.

Long-term Growth Drivers
The key drivers of our growth in 2006 and beyond will be the same factors that have fueled our progress over the past decade. They are: product innovation, channel expansion, international expansion and margin expansion. We feel we've got a strong lineup of product news and innovation planned in 2006. Some of those new items are pictured above ­ you'll find others on the following pages of this report. We see terrific opportunities for our brands in the many diverse retail channels that are selling packaged food today. Our Bakeries and Foodservice division sells to the many other channels for food eaten away from home. We have excellent opportunities to grow volume, sales and profits for our international businesses, including our Häagen-Dazs joint ventures in Asia and our Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture. And we expect our productivity initiatives companywide to drive margin expansion in the years ahead.

With Steve's retirement, several members of the General Mills leadership team have taken on new or expanded responsibilities. Randy Darcy has been named Executive Vice President, Worldwide Operations and T echnology. Jim Lawrence, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, now has responsibility for all International operations, including Canada. Ken Powell has been named Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, U.S. Retail. And Jeff Rotsch was named Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Channel Development, including responsibility for Bakeries and Foodservice. A complete listing of our senior leadership team appears on page 14 of this report. In closing, I want to acknowledge the many important accomplishments and contributions of our 27,800 employees worldwide. Their talent and commitment give me confidence that General Mills will build on its record of delivering superior returns to shareholders in the years ahead. Sincerely,
