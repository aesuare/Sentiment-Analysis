During 2006, the generally robust home demand characteristics of the last several years gave way to an increasingly competitive environment in many of the country's key homebuilding markets. Nevertheless, even in the face of these difficult circumstances, we closed 13,123 homes and generated more than $4.8 billion in revenues in 2006. And, although significantly lower than the record levels achieved in the last couple of years, both our net income of $214.3 million and earnings per share of $4.66 are among the four best annual earnings results in our Company's history. We reached these 2006 earnings despite recognizing $88 million in after-tax charges for asset impairments and project cost write-offs. More importantly, throughout the year, we continued to protect our `investment grade' financial position by: Expanding our combined cash and available borrowing capacity to $1.74 billion; Increasing our stockholders' equity by 11% to $2.16 billion; and Reducing our year-end ratio of debt-to-capital, net of cash, to 0.18, which continues to rank among the lowest in our industry.
U N WAVERING FINANCIAL AND OP E R AT I O NA L D I S C I P L I N E

Our continued progress is no accident. We have spent the past ten years developing and implementing a disciplined, conservative business strategy designed to help our Company generate and preserve shareowner value, even in the face of declining market conditions. Our philosophy of minimizing land risk is a central tenant of this strategy. Accordingly, we continued to manage our land during 2006 with the objective of controlling a two-year supply of lots in view of current demand for homes. As market conditions weakened, we renegotiated or terminated land purchase contracts that did not meet our high underwriting standards. As a result, our lots under option declined by 57% to 8,100 at year-end, for which we had less than $35 million in option deposits at risk. Furthermore, we reduced our total lots owned and controlled from the beginning of the year by 35%, leaving us with one of the lowest

lot supplies in the industry. Our reduced lot count led to a substantial reduction in our investment in homebuilding inventories, which enabled us to generate $363 million in operating cash flow during 2006 and end the year with more than $500 million in cash and no borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion homebuilding line of credit. Although in the past we have been criticized for being too conservative in acquiring land assets, we are extremely proud of the financial edge our approach gives us today. By avoiding excessive land investments in previous years, we are now poised to use our expanded financial resources to react quickly and prudently to profitable growth opportunities as they may arise.
F O C USED ON OPERATING EFFICIE N C Y

During 2006, we stepped up our efforts to reduce construction and development costs, improve construction cycle times and generally increase the efficiency of our homebuilding operations. We worked to right-size our operating and administrative infrastructure in response to declining market conditions, which contributed to a year-over-year reduction in our quarterly general and administrative expenses starting in the fourth quarter. We anticipate that our cost-control efforts will translate into additional savings of production costs and administrative expenses in 2007. Our financial services businesses made important contributions to our operating successes in 2006, led by the record profits of our HomeAmerican Mortgage subsidiary. Despite the reduced production and operating results of our homebuilding companies, HomeAmerican achieved a 59% year-overyear increase in operating profits in 2006. These results were accomplished by expanding the scope of mortgage products offered to our homebuyers and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of its services to our homebuilding companies. We plan to explore opportunities to enhance these operations further in 2007. At the same time, we will continue to look for ways to expand the scope of products and services offered to our customers by our American Home Insurance and American Home Title subsidiaries, both of which have become profitable complementary businesses for our Company.

In anticipation of an eventual turnaround for our industry, we will work diligently in 2007 to prepare our Company for future growth and success. We plan to open new model home complexes in more than 100 communities throughout the year, many of which will feature new or enhanced designs and/ or features that will better meet our customers' needs in this changing market. And we will continue to give special attention to educating and motivating our front-line sales associates, providing them the chance to overcome obstacles to selling and drive our Company's success during this transition period.
P O S ITIONED TO SEI ZE ON OPPORT U N I T Y

We remain optimistic with regard to the long-term prospects for our industry. While the length and severity of the current market adjustment is uncertain, we are hopeful that the fundamental drivers still present in most of our markets will in due course return the homebuilding industry to more healthy levels of demand. Irrespective of the timing of an industry turnaround, we remain committed to our conservative operating model and financial and operational disciplines. The resulting strength of our balance sheet, relatively short supply of lots and substantial cash and borrowing capacity, combined with our continuing efforts to reduce costs and expenses and improve our operating efficiencies, give us flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that we expect will be presented in this difficult environment. We appreciate those who have contributed to the strength of our Company, including our employees, subcontractors, financial partners and shareowners, and we thank them for their support in making 2006 a successful year for our Company by many measures. In addition, we extend a special appreciation for the tireless efforts of our dedicated Board of Directors, whose encouragement and commitment have been essential to our achievements over the last year.
