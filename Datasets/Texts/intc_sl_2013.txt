Letter From Your CEO
I am very excited to be Intel’s sixth CEO. In my first letter to you, I would like to share how we are building on Intel’s strengths to accelerate innovation and drive growth. But first, let’s look at the results for fiscal year 2013. Intel delivered revenue of $52.7 billion, net income of $9.6 billion, and earnings per share of $1.89. Client computing products generated $33 billion in revenue and approximately $12 billion in operating profits. Our datacenter business revenue grew to more than $11 billion, driven by rising demand for cloud services, high- performance computing, storage, and networking. We generated almost $21 billion in cash from operations and returned $6.6 billion to our stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
These are solid results in a time of rapid industry transformation, but we must do better. We are refocusing our efforts to reignite growth by driving Intel innovation to market faster.
Leading in the pursuit of Moore’s Law
The relentless pursuit of Moore’s Law is Intel’s foundation and continues to be our driving force. We lead the industry as the only semiconductor manufacturer in the world offering Tri-gate transistors and 22-nanometer (nm) technology-based products. The benefits of Moore’s Law can be seen across our product lines in the form of higher performance, lower energy requirements, and lower cost per transistor. In 2013, we introduced our 4th generation Intel® CoreTM processors, which deliver the largest generation-over-generation gain in battery life in Intel’s history, and a new family of low-power Intel® AtomTM processor-based System-on-Chips (SoCs) designed for high-performance mobile devices. We will continue this manufacturing leadership as we begin production of our 5th generation Intel Core processors (code-named “Broadwell”) on our next-generation 14nm process technology this year.
Accelerating mobility
The world of mobile client computing is expanding to include not only notebook computers and tablets, but also 2 in 1 devices that combine the best features of notebooks and tablets. We are taking aggressive steps to move swiftly in all of these market segments and to grow with them. Last year, we established a footprint in the tablet market with the shipment of more than 10 million micro- processors, and for 2014 we have set an aggressive goal to increase that number to 40 million. We also made significant advances in our 3G and 4G (LTE) communications capabilities in 2013. This year we are driving faster integration of these communications technologies into our SoCs.
Reinvigorating innovation
We are reinvigorating innovation at Intel and bringing it to market faster. For example, in September 2013 we introduced Intel® QuarkTM technology. This technology is designed for applications in fast-growing markets such as wearables and the “Internet of Things,” where the priorities are extremely small size and very low power consumption. We also announced innovative products such as
the Intel® Galileo development board, the first Intel architecture-based Arduino*-compatible board to support the maker and education communities; and the Intel® Edison development platform, a general-purpose computer housed in a tiny form factor designed to enable rapid innovation by inventors, entrepreneurs, and product designers. Neither of these products was on our roadmaps before mid-2013. You will continue to see a faster pace of innovation moving forward.
Our commitment to corporate responsibility
Corporate responsibility is an enduring Intel value that delivers returns for our company, stockholders, and society. In 2013, we continued to expand education opportunities for millions of students around the world, we were again the largest voluntary purchaser of green power in the U.S., and our employees donated more than 1 million volunteer hours to their communities. I am especially proud of our leadership in the area of “conflict minerals.” We have worked for five years to ensure that our products do not contain tantalum, tin, tungsten, or gold that finances or benefits armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. In 2013, we accomplished our goal to manufacture microprocessors that are DRC conflict-free.
Prepared for the opportunities ahead
I believe we have great opportunities ahead of us. Intel has leading products and technologies for growing markets, a strong work- force, and a heritage of leadership in driving Moore’s Law. We have sharpened our product focus and are accelerating the pace of our innovation. I look forward to growing stockholder return by delivering industry-leading products for a dynamic and changing marketplace and ensuring that “If it computes, it does it best with Intel.”

by high levels of profits, strong cash generation, and a healthy balance sheet. This
