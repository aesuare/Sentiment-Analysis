To our shareholders and friends:
2012 was a year of decisive action and spirited performance by
our employees, despite a challenging economic environment.
Letter to Shareholders 1
   While construction activity was weaker than in 2011, resulting in lower volumes for our Company, we never- theless delivered sharply improved operating results.
Actions taken by our people throughout the Company over the past several years have positioned Vulcan
for better performance in any phase of the economic cycle and especially in a recovering construction economy. We have achieved significant and sustain- able reductions in our cost structure, and we have continued to manage our business so as to allow our operations to participate fully in a recovery, at higher margins. We have grown aggregates unit profitability notwithstanding the weak economy. We expect that any meaningful demand recovery will translate into additional improvements in unit profitability and significant earnings growth.
And there are indications that demand is finally moving in the right direction. Residential construction momentum is improving, and the consensus is that the improvement will continue. Private non-residential construction contract awards continue to grow.
We are also encouraged about the funding of public infrastructure construction. The new Highway Bill, “MAP-21,” was signed into law by President Obama in July 2012. MAP-21 provides for a continuation of near-record funding levels through Fiscal Year 2014, while also significantly enhancing credit assistance funding for large infrastructure projects through the TIFIA (Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act) program. This legislation, which also includes important highway program reforms that will bring projects to completion sooner and with less

The last several years have presented us with a chal- lenging journey, but one we have every confidence will lead to record earnings well before volumes fully recover. The hostile takeover attempt by a competitor is behind us. In spite of the significant distractions and costs caused by Martin Marietta’s unsolicited exchange offer, our people continued to operate safely and efficiently, to serve our customers well, and
to build an even stronger Vulcan Materials Company. Our focus is clear, and our fundamental strengths— outstanding employees, strong and loyal customers, the best production locations in the United States, and superior cash gross profit margin per ton — remain firmly in place.
OVERVIEW OF RESULTS
Given the continuing weak macroeconomic environ- ment, our performance in 2012 was strong. We grew Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) significantly in 2012. We ended 2012 with our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year higher unit profitability in aggregates and lower SAG (selling, administrative, and general) expense. The key to our continued strong perfor- mance in the face of considerable headwinds is to be found in our people. Our workforce is second to none — the best in the business. The people of Vulcan are well trained, highly motivated and focused on what matters. This includes a keen focus on manag- ing controllable costs, as well as a commitment to meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations.

                    For 2012, cash gross profit per ton in aggregates was 5 percent higher than that of the prior year. SAG expense was down 11 percent and Adjusted EBITDA increased $59.5 million or 17 percent—all while
our aggregates shipments declined 1 percent. These results demonstrate the benefits of our ongoing focus on reducing controllable costs, maximizing operat- ing efficiency across the organization, and providing effective price leadership in our markets.
We have made concerted efforts to enhance our profitability by extending and improving our already robust procurement practices to capture significant incremental savings across a broad array of spending categories. We are also seeing a positive impact from the critical investments we have made over the past few years to replace legacy IT systems and processes with new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
and shared services platforms. We have significantly streamlined processes and reduced back-office
costs while providing enhanced reporting flexibility to monitor and control costs. These restructuring actions taken in 2011 and 2012 resulted in annual- ized overhead cost savings of more than $55 million.
OUTLOOK 2013 AND BEYOND
As you can see by the accompanying charts of leading indicators of construction activity — includ- ing residential, private non-residential, highways and non-highway infrastructure—the outlook for our industry and our business is improving. This
is the first time in years that we are starting to see an emerging recovery in these indicators, especially in the private sector.

While the economic and construction-related fun- damentals that drive demand for our products continue to improve from the historically low levels created by the economic downturn, there is a lag
in the impact on our businesses. Our expectations for growth in volumes in 2013 are consequently cautious; but we are confident that improving con- struction contract awards, both public and private, will lead to considerably higher demand for our products as these projects get underway. However great the actual improvement may be, our strong operating leverage will enable us to generate signifi- cant earnings growth as the economy improves.
Leading indicators of private construction activity, specifically residential housing starts and contract awards for nonresidential buildings, continue to improve in our markets. Consequently, aggregates demand in private construction, particularly resi- dential, is beginning to grow. We are seeing evidence
of this growth in several key states, including California, Georgia, Florida, Texas and Arizona.
For public construction, passage of the new federal highway bill in July of 2012 is providing stability and predictability to future highway funding. The large increase in TIFIA funds contained in the new highway bill provides leveraged funding of up to $50 billion according to the U.S. Department
of Transportation, and should positively affect demand in the future. TIFIA program support for large-scale transportation infrastructure projects has already been eagerly embraced by several of the largest states in the U.S. — some of the biggest TIFIA projects in the nation are in Vulcan-served states such as California, Texas, Florida and Virginia. The uncertain timing of larger projects, including TIFIA- funded projects, continues to make forecasting quarterly volume growth difficult.

                      CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR BALANCE SHEET
Our balance sheet continues to improve. To maintain that momentum, our management team will con- tinue to focus on prudently divesting non-core assets, reducing debt and building our aggregates positions
in key markets to strengthen an aggregates asset port- folio that already delivers the highest unit cash gross profit in the aggregates industry.
We generated $238.5 million in cash from our oper- ations in 2012. We raised another $168.6 million
in cash proceeds from various strategic asset sales and related transactions. We retired an additional
$135 million in debt and made several strategic investments. This left us with $275.5 million cash on hand, which is available to pay the $151 million
of debt maturities scheduled in 2013. We expect future debt maturities will be funded from available cash and free cash flows, with our $600 million
line of credit still in place for short-term liquidity needs. We expect net interest expense to decrease by approximately $14 million from 2012 to 2013.
These moves have greatly enhanced our liquidity
and are providing the financial flexibility to continue investing in our business as the economy, and our volumes, recover. Measures such as these, combined with our efforts to enhance profitability, will also enable us to achieve an important goal for us: restor- ing a meaningful dividend.

ENDURING STRENGTHS
Aggregates are the most essential of basic inputs to private and public construction, infrastructure and growth. Vulcan remains the leading supplier of those aggregates in the United States, with unmatched, easily accessed, permitted reserves and superior aggregates operations.
We are well-positioned to capitalize on market recovery. Recent financial results demonstrate strong operating leverage, with commensurately strong conversion of incremental sales to cash flow. Our de-risked balance sheet provides great potential to deliver enhanced shareholder value going forward. We offer proven operational expertise, attractive
unit profitability and industry-leading pricing growth. All of these factors contribute to our favorable pros- pects for long-term growth.
Population growth drives demand for our essential products, and our footprint is concentrated in dynamic markets where population continues to grow at a pace exceeding national averages by a significant factor. Our aggregates assets are strategically posi- tioned in attractive markets. We serve more of the nation’s high-growth areas than any other aggregates producer — 19 of the 25 highest-growth metropolitan areas in the United States are served by Vulcan.
We are fully prepared to meet demand as it rises. Our high-quality reserves — at 15 billion tons, the country’s largest reported proven and probable reserve base — are close to these growth markets, and our distribution systems are unsurpassed. And we have the right people to meet the challenges ahead.
In a year that brought many challenges, our employ- ees stayed the course, delivered superior results in our aggregates business, and proved once again that they are the very best in the business. Their focus and efforts have positioned Vulcan for superior per- formance and results.
We are optimistic about our future. Vulcan offers enduring, fundamental strengths and remains well-positioned for increasing profitability and significant long-term growth.
Thank you for your continued interest and support.
