TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
A slowing economy created new challenges
for M&I in the year 2001 Ð challenges that were met with determination, optimism, and success.
As a result, your Corporation performed well within the financial services industry. Deposits continued to grow in both our commercial and retail areas, mortgage volume doubled, and our trust company had a strong year. We also aggressively sought new opportunities for growth and found them in eight key acquisitions, enabling us to expand beyond our traditional markets and increase our presence within our current markets.
We ended the year with $27.3 billion in assets. Operating earnings were $406 million. Operating earnings per share were $3.72, an increase of 12 percent over the prior year.
On the banking side, our acquisitions of National City Bancorporation, Richfield State Agency, Inc., and Century Bancshares, Inc. will increase our pres- ence in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area, giving us new opportunities in this growing market.
