To Our Shareholders:
"A Leader in Global Infrastructure" is our theme for this annual report. It highlights our outstanding performance in 2008 through our support of critical infrastructure projects around the world. As a key provider of products and services for a variety of industries, we were honored this year to be added to the select membership of the S&P 500 Index. Now into our second decade under the Flowserve banner and supported by a heritage of more than 200 years, being a leader in global infrastructure is a position of which we are proud and strive daily to maintain.
As a leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems, Flowserve continued in 2008 to expand our presence supporting infrastructure initiatives around the world. Our dedication toward global leadership in our industry drove us to another year of record-setting performance across several key operating measurements. These results and returns for our shareholders were driven by a dedicated and focused workforce of more than 15,000 associates in more than 55 countries. Flowserve global leadership was again focused around our clearly articulated identity statement and key strategies. We continue to develop and manufacture precision-engineered flow control equipment -- primarily pumps, valves, and seals -- for critical service applications in the oil and gas, power generation, chemical, water, and general industry markets. This strategy emphasizes industry diversity and geographic breadth to mitigate the impact of normal economic downturns in any one of the industries or parts of the world we serve.

The backbone of our global manufacturing and service platform remains our Quick Response Centers (QRCs). Now totaling more than 150 QRCs worldwide, in 2008 we opened new or expanded facilities in India, Russia, Norway, Malaysia, New Zealand, Canada, as well as other strategically important markets. Globalization highlights centered on significant agreements with some of our largest customers around the world. We signed a 10-year strategic supplier agreement with Saudi Aramco to supply our entire range of flow control products and value-added services for use in their existing and planned facilities. Flowserve also completed a strategic cooperation agreement to be the preferred vendor to China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec), and finalized an exclusive relationship with Petrobras at one of the largest refineries in Brazil -- our first alliance with a national oil company in Latin America. Also in Brazil, we announced plans to invest more than $15 million for a new 130,000 square foot manufacturing plant to support the new "mega" oil field discoveries there. We also completed the full purchase of Niigata Worthington, a previously 50/50 Pump Division joint venture in Japan, as well as the development of a new joint venture with The Linde Group in Germany. This initiative features the development of ionic compression

technology, iKompressor,TM and will provide a platform for global business in clean fuel refueling technologies. To support global infrastructure requirements, we remain focused on our robust product offerings -- a lineup supported by a research and development investment of more than $80 million over the last three years. Further, to provide the highest level of value to our customers, we continue emphasizing our aftermarket and LifeCycle AdvantageTM programs. These dedicated approaches strengthen existing customer relationships and deliver improved asset and energy management, plant process flow control, and reduced total cost of equipment ownership. As always, our commitment to excellence starts from within. In 2008, we continued to focus on our organizational capability by launching and enhancing a number of comprehensive education initiatives. Subjects ranged from ethics and compliance, facility safety, and harassment awareness training, to highly-sophisticated pump reliability, rotating equipment, and certified artisan programs. This approach also extends to our process excellence strategy and continuous improvement process (CIP) initiatives. With more than 1,400 CIP "Green Belts" or "Black Belts" worldwide, we continue to implement processes to reduce engineering and manufacturing time, improve on-time delivery and service response

time, as well as lower inventory levels and reduce costs. Led by the Flowserve Technology Office, we continue to invest in the exploration and commercialization of new and emerging technologies that enable us to deliver a continuous stream of innovative products. This effort focuses on five major areas: materials science, fluid dynamics, mechanical design, mechatronics, and electronics and software.

Combined, all of these focused efforts have been instrumental in the evolution and strength of the Flowserve brand name. Research reveals that since 2003, the image of Flowserve has evolved favorably. Where we were once viewed almost exclusively as a pump manufacturer, today we benefit from being seen as a comprehensive provider of pumps, valves, and seals -- and more importantly, as a trusted partner our customers around the world count on every day. It is a position we know we must work hard to maintain. But by continuing to execute against our strategies, we will capitalize on global growth opportunities and deepen our relationships with customers to support long-term success. Most importantly, the creativity, energy, and dedication of our employees around the world will help us maintain and expand our place as A Leader in Global Infrastructure.
