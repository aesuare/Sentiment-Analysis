FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FIN

In July, we acquired Valbart Srl, an Italian manufacturer of trunnion-mounted ball valves. Supporting our Innovation & Portfolio Management strategy, Valbart's products filled a gap in our product portfolio and significantly strengthened our ability to provide a more complete valve package to oil and gas projects. Customer and operating successes were numerous, diverse and global in 2010. Some highlights include: multiple orders from China Nuclear Power Engineering Company for main steam isolation and other valves; a licensing agreement with Zvezdochka Ship Repair Center in Russia to provide the proprietary know-how for the purchasing and production of thrusters used in ship propulsion systems; the signing of a sole source, preferred supplier agreement with Shell used in control valves and related instrumentation; plug valves and Calder energy recovery device orders for desalination projects in Israel and Australia; N and NPT nuclear approvals for our valve manufacturing facility in Springville, Utah; significant oil and gas pump orders from around the world including the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations for the Bida Al Qemzan field development project, and the LUKOIL Neftochim Burgas refinery in Bulgaria. Supporting the continued strength and flexibility of our capital structure, we announced in December the completion of a new $1 billion, five-year credit facility. It includes a $500 million term loan and a $500 million revolver that the company can increase, subject to certain conditions, by up to $200 million. The facility, together with our cash position of $558 million at year end, provides an excellent financial base for our future. Overall, we are pleased with our 2010 results and we remain excited about the future prospects for the company. In 2011, we will remain focused on executing our Operational Excellence and other strategies, ensuring that our customers receive quality products and services, on-time deliveries and competitive pricing. We are confident that we have positioned the business to drive disciplined profitable growth as we leverage our optimized operating platform, proven product offerings, balance sheet strength and -- most importantly -- the proven capabilities and dedication of Flowserve employees.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
As we evaluated themes for this annual report, Driving Disciplined Profitable Growth was the clear choice. Not only is it one of our newly refined Key Strategies we announced in 2010, but it is a fundamental business objective that drives many of our decisions. While 2010 was a year of significant changes and challenges, we delivered positive business results and returns for our shareholders thanks to the commitment of our 15,000 employees in more than 50 countries around the world. It is through their collective dedication that we continue to maintain an industry leadership position as a manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control products, systems and solutions. In December of 2009, we announced plans to integrate our former seal and pump divisions into a single entity to be known as the Flow Solutions Group. We are particularly proud of our integration efforts in 2010, as we position our operating platform for future growth and continue to drive our Customer Intimacy strategy. Employing our Operational Excellence strategy, we made strides toward completing our announced realignment initiatives and began to drive a cost culture throughout the organization. At the same time, we strengthened our global footprint and local capabilities by substantially increasing our presence in rapidly growing Asian, Middle Eastern and Latin American markets. This effort, also part of our Strategic Localization strategy, includes the completion or ongoing construction of new production facilities in China, India, the Middle East and Brazil.
