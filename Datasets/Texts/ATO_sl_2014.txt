To Our Shareholders
Three years ago, we made a sea change in Atmos Energy's core growth strategy, and today it is benefiting our investors, customers and communities.
Our strategy had been to grow through acquisitions of strategically situated natural gas distribution assets. As our founding chairman, Charles K. Vaughan, noted last year on Atmos Energy's 30th anniversary, had he and the board of directors not staked out that strategy--one completely counterintuitive to the rest of the utility industry at the time--Atmos Energy would not have survived. The company was a regional gas utility in West Texas with little or no customer growth to sustain it. Kim R. Cocklin By diversifying and growing through 10 President and major acquisitions over two decades, Charlie Chief Executive Officer and his successor, Bob Best, built one of the largest and best-managed natural gas utility systems in the United States. Atmos Energy not only has remained independent, but also has prospered beyond all expectations. It has expanded into many states, and its regulated distribution and pipeline operations have produced steady growth in earnings and dividends.  Today Atmos Energy has amassed such a sound portfolio of integrated assets that investing in our own operations yields much better returns than acquiring more distribution assets. Our six regulated distribution divisions and our Texas regulated intrastate pipeline produce stable and predictable results for our investors, our customers and the communities we serve. Our nonregulated business also adds value to our portfolio of assets.  Although we do not rule out acquisitions, we are dedicated to growth for the foreseeable future from investing principally in our regulated assets.

 Even more importantly, our growth strategy is designed to advance our goal of becoming the nation's safest natural gas utility.  Fortunately, the states we serve began recognizing the need to modernize infrastructure before the rest of the nation. Legislatures and regulatory authorities in our states have promulgated or approved rate design that encourages investments to replace or fortify infrastructure and significantly reduces the lag time in recovering those investments.  Today we are recovering and earning on approximately 91 percent of our infrastructure investments within six months after a test year ends and on 96 percent of our investments within 12 months.  This balanced regulatory treatment resulted in our capital spending in fiscal 2014 of $835.3 million. Our projected capital investments in fiscal 2015 should be between $900 million and $1.0 billion.  This significant level of capital spending will further our journey toward becoming the country's safest utility and will increase our future shareholder value.

 EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS

  In fiscal 2014, we achieved exceptional results that demonstrate the benefits of our realigned growth strategy.  Consolidated net income increased 19 percent from $243.2 million in fiscal 2013 to $289.8 million in fiscal 2014. Earnings per diluted share went up 32 cents, from $2.64 in fiscal 2013 to $2.96 in fiscal 2014. The year-over-year increase marked our 12th consecutive year of growth in earnings per share.  Dividends paid per share were $1.48, an increase of 8 cents, or 5.7 percent, over the previous year's dividend. Our payout ratio of between 50 percent and 55 percent remains below that of most utilities, allowing for continued annual increases in our dividend.  Total shareholder return in fiscal 2014 was 15.5 percent. Our three-year total return to shareholders since implementing our new strategy in fiscal 2012 was 63.8 percent. That compares with an average shareholder return among 11 "peer" companies during the same three-year period of 56.4 percent.  As a sign of confidence in the direction the company is headed, our board of directors in November 2014 increased the annual dividend again by 8 cents a share. The indicated dividend for fiscal 2015 is $1.56 a share. This marked our 31st consecutive annual dividend increase.  More than 75 percent of our capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 were dedicated to safety and reliability. Atmos Energy's total regulated rate base grew by $578.0 million to approximately $4.9 billion.

 REGULATORY OUTCOMES

 Our growth strategy is designed to increase the value of our regulated rate base between 9 percent and 10 percent on a compounded annual basis through fiscal 2018. The timely recovery of our infrastructure investments and regulated expenses through constructive regulatory mechanisms is the key driver of our financial results.  During fiscal 2014, we implemented new rates from 18 filings. When combined with regulatory deferrals, these rate outcomes should result in operating income increases of approximately $134.0 million.  About $115.2 million of these operating income increases resulted from filings in Texas, where almost 70 percent of our regulated assets are located.  We forecast adding during the next four fiscal years between $100 million and $135 million annually in operating income increases from rate adjustments.
 WEATHER EFFECTS

 Weather, which was 20 percent colder than normal in fiscal 2014, boosted the earnings of our regulated distribution segment, regulated pipeline segment and nonregulated segment. Six of the eight states we serve recorded the coldest heating season in the past 15 years.

 The effects of colder weather increased the throughput for all three operating segments and added about $17.1 million, or 17 cents per diluted share, to fiscal 2014 consolidated net income.  Atmos Pipeline­Texas (APT), our intrastate natural gas transmission and storage system, transported 714 billion cubic feet of gas during fiscal 2014. APT's system overlays the prolific Barnett Shale natural gas basin and reaches other producing and shale-gas areas. Its pipelines span across Texas with connections to the state's three major natural gas hubs at Waha, Katy and Carthage.  APT has been adding capabilities to transport reliable and affordable gas supplies to serve primarily our MidTex Division and other local gas distribution customers in Texas. These investments also help APT transport natural gas reliably to new and existing electric power plants and industrial facilities.  Higher natural gas consumption during fiscal 2014 also created more volatility in wholesale gas prices.  Our nonregulated segment was able to take great advantage of the market opportunities caused by the wider spreads in gas prices. Atmos Energy Marketing--which buys, sells and arranges transportation for large volumes of natural gas at competitive prices to major customers in some 20 states and to our own system--nearly tripled its year-over-year contributions to fiscal 2014 consolidated earnings.  Because we assume a return to normal weather in fiscal 2015, we do not anticipate our nonregulated segment repeating these results.
FINANCING

ratio of 46.2 percent. We had nearly $1.2 billion in available liquidity to meet our expected financial requirements.  Rating agencies have recognized the strengths of our balance sheet, constructive regulatory outcomes and peer-leading growth in earnings per share. Our corporate credit ratings were upgraded during the fiscal year by Moody's Investors Service from Baa1 to A2 and by Standard & Poor's from BBB+ to A-.
OUTLOOK

 To raise additional capital, we sold 9.2 million shares of our common stock in February 2014 at $44.00 a share. We used the $390.2 million of net proceeds from the offering to fund infrastructure improvements, to repay short-term debt under our commercial paper program and to support other corporate needs.  In October 2014, we replaced $500 million of maturing 4.95 percent senior notes with $500 million of 4.125 percent senior notes due October 2044. The issuance will reduce our weighted average cost of long-term debt and will save about $8 million annually in interest expense.  We also have taken advantage of historically low interest rates to lock in Treasury yield components of interest rates for two planned future refinancings for retiring debt. For our $250 million of 6.35 percent 10-year senior notes maturing in June 2017, the Treasury component of the future issue will effectively be fixed at 3.367 percent. The Treasury component for refinancing our $450 million of 8.50 percent 10-year senior notes that mature in March 2019 will effectively be fixed at 3.857 percent. The refinancings will lower our weighted average cost of debt and will extend weighted average maturities.  At the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2014, our balance sheet was strong with a debt-to-total-capitalization

  We have issued Atmos Energy's fiscal 2015 earnings guidance to be between $2.90 and $3.05 per diluted share, excluding net unrealized margins.  Our capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2018 are projected to be between $900 million and $1.1 billion annually. We expect to finance this growth through $800 million to $1.0 billion of incremental financing.  In turn, we forecast that the value of our rate base will increase at a compounded annual growth rate from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2018 of between 9 percent and 10 percent, with a total value by the end of fiscal 2018 of between $7.2 billion and $7.4 billion.  Earnings growth of 6 percent to 8 percent, combined with a dividend yield in the range of 3 percent, should provide our shareholders an attractive total annual return between 9 percent and 11 percent.  Significantly, the approximately $4 billion we plan to invest in infrastructure improvements during the next four fiscal years should have little effect on our customers' total bills. With delivered natural gas prices forecast to remain stable in the range of $5 to $6 per 1,000 cubic feet and assuming normal weather, our average residential customer's monthly bill should remain well below $60.
 AMERICA'S SAFEST GAS COMPANY

 In this annual report, we discuss the significant level of capital expenditures we are making in all the states we serve to modernize and expand our natural gas transmission and delivery system. We are a leader in our industry in pursuing these improvements and are proud of the exceptional efforts by our employees to achieve these results.  Our goal is to be the safest natural gas company in America. It is a continuing journey toward that goal, but we are fully committed and well on our way to achieving that distinction. It is a goal that will protect and benefit our customers, communities, employees and investors for decades to come.
