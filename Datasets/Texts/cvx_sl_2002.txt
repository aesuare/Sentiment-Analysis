    Our most immediate challenge is to improve the returns on our invested capital. Our strategies to accomplish this are focused on improving the performance of our existing assets, developing new assets that can deliver superior returns and exiting those assets that do not offer the long-term potential to create value for you, our stockholders.

 TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS
ChevronTexaco ended its first year following the merger with many notable achievements but with a clear challenge to improve the companyÕs financial performance.
Net income for 2002 was down more than 65 percent compared with the previous year. Likewise, the value of our companyÕs stock Ð as with that of others in the energy industry and the broader market Ð experienced a sharp downturn.
We are not satisfied with these results, and we are working aggressively to achieve substantial and sustainable improvement in the performance of all our businesses.
 As we improve, we are building on a solid foundation, including a strong balance sheet and excellent investment opportunities that the merger, completed in late 2001, provided. Today, we have the size, scope and financial capabilities to create greater value for our stockholders.
The merger also has enabled us to deliver major cost savings. By the end of the first quarter of 2003, the company will have achieved an annual synergy capture rate of $2.2 billion Ð far higher than the $1.2 billion we had estimated at the outset.
STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS
Our most immediate challenge is to improve the returns on our invested capital. Our strategies to accomplish this are focused on improving the performance of our existing assets, developing new assets that can deliver superior returns and exiting those assets that do not offer the long-term potential to create value for you, our stockholders.

 In the upstream business, we have leading posi- tions in some of the most promising regions of the world, including Eurasia, West Africa, Latin America, Australia and the U.S. deep- water Gulf of Mexico. We have a portfolio of major projects that will come onstream during the next five years, contributing significantly to production and reserves. We also intend to build a profitable global natural gas business, based on our large developed and undevel- oped gas positions in North America, Africa and Australia.
In downstream operations, we are focusing on improving the performance of our refining and marketing businesses by capitalizing on our larger scale to lower costs and competi- tively leveraging our enhanced market and supply positions.
Throughout our worldwide operations, we continue to focus on building organizational capability in two areas that are critical to our success Ð capital stewardship and operational excellence. In capital stewardship, we have
been working to improve decision quality and project execution, and we are seeing measur- able progress. For example, at $8.5 billion, our 2003 capital and exploratory budget is 17 per- cent lower than the combined budget of the pre-merger companies, yet it fully satisfies our strategic priorities.
We also are making strides in operational excel- lence, which means running our businesses safely, reliably and efficiently. 2002 was the safest year ever for employees and contractors, a notable achievement that occurred during
a period of major transition. At the same time, our worldwide refinery utilization rate increased to 91 percent, and we have set targets for increased reliability in all our businesses.
If you take only one message from this annual report, it should be that ChevronTexaco is indeed Òup to the challengeÓ of improving its financial performance. By aggressively imple- menting our strategies, we intend to deliver strong results and overcome the challenges that negatively affected our performance in 2002.

    FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Weak global economies, restrained demand for petroleum products and lower production all took a toll on 2002 earnings. For the year, ChevronTexaco reported net income of $1.1 bil- lion, compared with $3.3 billion in 2001.
The companyÕs financial results were hurt by $3.3 billion of charges from special items. About $2.3 billion of these charges were related to our 26 percent ownership of Dynegy Inc., an energy trading company that saw a dramatic decline in its market value due to the near col- lapse of the energy merchant sector.
Exploration and production income of $4.6 bil- lion was about 6 percent higher than in 2001, reflecting lower asset write-downs, which were offset partially by a decline in oil-equivalent production and weaker U.S. natural gas prices.
Refining, marketing and transportation posted a loss of nearly $400 million in 2002, compared with income of $1.8 billion the previous year. The poor 2002 results reflected weak margins
for refined products, which early in the year fell to their lowest levels in more than a decade.
In chemicals, the combined income of Chevron Oronite, which produces additives for fuels and lubricants, and our 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC was $86 mil- lion, compared with a $128 million loss the previous year. Although results improved, the commodity chemicals industry continues to be affected by weak demand and excess manu- facturing capacity.
A YEAR OF PROGRESS AND POSITIVE CHANGE
Despite many challenges, 2002 was a year of progress and positive change. Perhaps the most important achievement was the success- ful integration of the operations, organizations and people of Chevron and Texaco. Through- out our global enterprise, we came together as a unified company with shared values and a common vision.

 We also marked several other milestones during the year:
¥ Our exploration program benefited from the best technology, processes and practices of the pre-merger companies. Some of our most notable successes were achieved in the deep waters of West Africa and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including the Usan and Aparo dis- coveries offshore Nigeria, the Gabela and Negage discoveries offshore Angola, and
the Tahiti and Great White discoveries in the Gulf of Mexico.
¥ For the 10th consecutive year, we added more oil-equivalent proved reserves than we pro- duced. Through discoveries, acquisitions and other additions, we replaced 114 percent of our 2002 production.
¥ We added significant amounts of proved reserves to our natural gas resource base and made progress on several major projects. For example, ChevronTexaco and five other par- ticipants in AustraliaÕs North West Shelf Venture signed a conditional 25-year contract with the PeopleÕs Republic of China to supply up to
3 million metric tons a year of liquefied natural
gas (LNG) for the proposed Guangdong LNG project in southern China.
¥ In the Caspian region, we moved forward to improve both our production and trans- portation systems. Our Tengizchevroil (TCO) partnership increased production for the ninth consecutive year. Also, in the second half of the year, TCO was able to transport all its crude oil through the more cost-effective Caspian Pipeline ConsortiumÕs 935-mile (1,505-kilo- meter) pipeline to Novorossiysk, a Russian port on the Black Sea. In 2003, we expect to com- plete a second pipeline, which will link our 20 percent-owned Karachaganak Field to the Caspian pipeline.
¥ The companyÕs annual dividend payment increased for the 15th consecutive year, reflect- ing our commitment to provide a superior return on our stockholdersÕ investment.

a struggling global economy. Yet, there are extraordinary opportunities for a company with our capabilities.
ChevronTexaco is a major player in the global energy industry. And we are focused on our most important financial objective Ð to be No. 1 among our largest global competitors in total stockholder return for the period 2000
benefit the communities in which we operate. By holding firm to our values, we are moving toward our vision of being the global energy company most admired for its people, partner- ship and performance.
It is no accident that people are listed first in our vision statement. Our diverse global work force is the most important factor in our

We have an active, independent Board of Directors that brings a wealth of experience to this important role Ð including expertise in government, education, industrial manu- facturing, consumer products and high technology. The integrity, knowledge and perspectives of our Board are invaluable
to ChevronTexaco as we make decisions that will enable us to achieve our ambitious goals.
Our company values, too, are essential as we pursue our objectives. In everything we do, we are guided by our commitment to conduct our business in a responsible and ethical manner. We respect the law, support universal human rights, protect the environment and
success, and I applaud the 53,000 employees
of ChevronTexaco for their contributions. It
is through their work that the company is wel- comed around the world and has become a partner of choice in some of the most impor- tant projects in the energy industry. And it is through the work of ChevronTexaco people that we will prove we are up to the challenge of delivering the performance our stockholders expect of us and we expect of ourselves.
