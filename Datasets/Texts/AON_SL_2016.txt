2017 Annual Shareholder Letter To Our Shareholders: Aon strives to create value for clients, and the strength of our client relationships is based on the level of insight we deliver. Those relationships are more important now than ever, because our clients are facing an increasingly volatile world. In the last year, we continued to see three global market realities ­ economic, demographic and geopolitical realities, combined with the exponential pace of technology change ­ all converge to create a challenging business environment, while at the same time creating a level of opportunity that we have never seen before. It is in this environment that we use our insights and expertise to advise our clients to empower results that will help define the future. I am proud to report that in 2016, Aon delivered organic revenue growth across every major business, record operating margins in both segments, and seven percent earnings growth, while continuing to make strategic investments in client-driven solutions across the firm, including data and analytics, cyber risk advisory, health and elective benefits, and delegated investment management. We also generated a record $2.1 billion of free cash flow and continued to improve return on invested capital through effective capital management. In addition to significant organic investments that increase operating leverage and drive long-term growth, the firm deployed $2.5 billion of capital on behalf of shareholders in 2016 through share repurchase, dividends, and $1 billion on attractive acquisitions in high-growth areas of our business. In Risk: x We strengthened our ability to serve clients as a global leader in cyber risk management by completing the acquisition of Stroz Friedberg in 2016. This acquisition has brought together two of the world's most highly skilled and accomplished teams focused on cyber risk transfer, mitigation, advisory, and response.

We are making an unmatched level of investment in data and analytics in our Reinsurance business to strengthen the long-term value proposition and level of insight we can provide to clients, as well as identify new opportunities to match capital to previously uninsured risks. We are empowering carriers to become more competitive, effective, and operationally efficient through our continued investment in Aon InPoint, a growing business that integrates our market leading data and analytics (Global Risk Insight Platform and ReView) with strategic consulting.

In Retirement: x We are enabling clients to efficiently and effectively manage and de-risk their pension plans through integrated actuarial services, investment consulting and administration solutions. We invested in Risk Analyzer, an innovative, global analytical tool to help clients dynamically manage their pension plans, as well as industry-leading analytics to help clients better manage longevity risk in their plans. x We are expanding our investment consulting and delegated investment solutions for pensions, and introduced delegated investment solutions for defined contribution plans and charitable organizations; a strong area of growth where total assets under management have grown from $10 billion to nearly $100 billion in five years. We completed the acquisition of Modern Survey, a firm specializing in leading edge employee engagement solutions, as well as Co-Cubes, a leader in talent assessment.

In Health: x We are delivering a comprehensive portfolio of health solutions for clients, covering the full spectrum of benefit strategies, client size, and funding choices, continuing to increase our footprint in the private health exchange market for active employees and retirees. x x We are providing superior advice and driving better outcomes for clients' and their employees by investing in data and analytics across our Health practices. We completed the acquisition of Admix, a leading health and benefits brokerage and solutions firm in Brazil, as well as Univers, a leading elective benefits enrollment services firm.

We ended 2016 in a position of strength; delivering another year of substantial progress across each of our key financial metrics.

Lastly, and highlighted in the chart below, we have also consistently outperformed the S&P Index and our primary peer set, delivering double-digit annualized total returns over the last decade.

For the last decade, Aon has been on a mission to become the leading global advisory firm focused on risk, retirement, and health solutions. We have taken strategic actions designed to achieve our mission while maximizing shareholder value creation, beginning with the dispositions of our lower margin, capital intensive insurance underwriting businesses in Risk. We reallocated capital from balance sheets to high-value solutions, strengthened our capabilities to serve global clients locally, and invested to build a set of unmatched data and analytics across Aon's platform, including: x $85 billion of risk premium supported by Inpoint and ReView technology x $30 billion of health premium with a full set of health solutions x $4 trillion of pension assets under independent advisory, with nearly $100 billion under delegation

More recently, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our benefits administration and HR business process outsourcing assets. We believe this transaction reflects a continuation of our proven strategy, is further evidence of our disciplined capital management approach to drive improved return on invested capital, and creates a catalyst for the next step of significant shareholder value creation. As a result of our significant free cash flow generation combined with the proceeds from this transaction, we expect to have substantial capital to deploy over the next three years to reinforce our strategy, accelerate growth, and invest in our highest margin, highest return opportunities across the firm. We are always evaluating new ideas that create value for our clients. That is an important point ­ it all starts with client demand. Ultimately, we need to be able to innovate faster than our clients in order to provide advice and solutions that better position them for the future. In addition, we are continuing to evolve to a single operating model that will drive greater efficiency and bring the best of the entire firm to each and every client. We call this Aon United. We have made considerable progress delivering Aon United when we are at our best, but it is now time to take make this our prevailing culture. Continuing this Aon United journey will help us create more value for our clients and deliver cost savings through the creation of a next generation shared services model that allows for better scalability, flexibility and enhanced colleague and client experience. We enter 2017 in a position to both increase investment in client-driven innovation and create efficiencies through operating model integration, resulting in accelerated growth and free cash flow generation. We are excited about this next step and what it means for Aon, for our clients, and for our shareholders. Thank you for the continued faith and trust you have placed in our Board of Directors and management team. Your support is critical, and we will continue to work hard to exceed your expectations.
