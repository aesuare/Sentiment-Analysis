MAJOR PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS
With a ocus on creating diverse value channels or our unitholders and greater service o erings to our customers, Enterprise undertakes numerous special projects o varying scale each year. We are pleased to highlight three such major projects executed during 2014.

ETHANE EXPORT FACILITY

'

.

This acility will have a loading rate o approximately 200 thousand barrels per day ("MBPD") across two docks and is approximately 80 percent contracted. It will provide ethylene crackers and other end-use markets access to the most proli ic supplies o ethane in the world. This acility is expected to be completed in the third quarter o 2016.

OILTANKING ACQUISITION

. This location is the oundation or our Lique ied Petroleum Gas ("LPG") export terminal expansion. We have an over 30-year history o operating our terminal on land ormerly owned by Oiltanking. Now, we own the land and the LPG acility, which we will expand to 16 million barrels per month ("MMBbls/mo") o loading capacity rom approximately 7.5 MMBbls/mo today. The expansion is expected to be completed in the ourth quarter o 2015.

PDH UNIT

"

".

This project capitalizes on lower propylene production rom ethylene crackers, which has decreased by 5.4 billion lbs or 37 percent since 2010 due to the decline in cracking naphtha. This acility is contracted with average 15-year ee-based contracts with investment grade companies. The unit is expected to be completed in the third quarter o 2016.

TO OUR INVESTORS
2014 WAS ANOTHER RECORD YEAR FOR ENTERPRISE.
We continued to bene t from growing domestic production of crude oil, natural gas liquids ("NGLs") and natural gas from the shale plays as well as U.S. and international demand for NGLs and re ned products. Our 51,000-mile pipeline system transported a record 5.3 million barrels per day ("BPD") of NGLs, crude oil, re ned products and petrochemicals, and 13.1 billion cubic feet per day ("BCF/d") of natural gas. Our NGL fractionators, which separate mixed NGLs into their purity products, averaged a record 824,000 BPD, and our natural gas processing facilities had record fee-based volumes of 4.8 BCF/d in 2014. We successfully completed $4.1 billion of major capital growth projects that began commercial operations and contributing new sources of fee-based cash ow during 2014. These projects included: the 1,205-mile Appalachia-to-Texas ("ATEX") ethane pipeline, which transports ethane rom the Marcellus and Utica shale plays to petrochemical markets on the U.S. Gul Coast, and the 512-mile loop o our jointly owned Seaway Crude Oil pipeline expanding our capacity to transport crude oil rom the Cushing, Oklahoma hub to markets on the Texas Gul Coast. Overall, our 2014 growth capital projects came in 2.3 percent under budget and were generally completed on time or ahead o schedule. Another signi icant milestone was our $5.9 billion acquisition o Oiltanking Partners L.P., which was completed in February 2015. Oiltanking owns marine terminals on the Houston Ship Channel and the Port o Beaumont with a total o 12 ship and barge docks and approximately 26 million barrels o crude oil and petroleum products storage capacity on the Texas Gul Coast. Enterprise has had a strategic relationship with Oiltanking and its predecessors since 1983, and several o our assets are integrated with Oiltanking's acilities on the Houston Ship Channel. We believe the combination o Enterprise's system o midstream assets and Oiltanking's waterborne access to international markets and storage assets will strengthen and broaden our midstream energy services business.

RECORD FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION IN 2014
Volume growth and placing new assets in service contributed to a 10 percent increase in gross operating margin to a record $5.3 billion in 2014, with all ive business segments reporting higher gross operating margin compared to 2013. Enterprise generated distributable cash low ("DCF") o $4.1 billion in 2014, a 9 percent increase compared to 2013. Cash distributions declared with respect to 2014 increased 5.8 percent to $1.45 per unit, a er adjusting or the 2- or-1 unit split in August 2014. We have increased our quarterly cash distribution or 42 consecutive quarters, the longest period o any o the publicly traded MLPs. Since our initial public o ering in 1998, we have increased our quarterly cash distribution rate 51 times at a 7.6 percent compound annual growth rate. DCF or 2014 provided 1.5 times coverage o cash distributions paid with respect to 2014. Enterprise retained $1.4 billion o DCF. Since our ormation, we have retained $7.9 billion, or 31 percent, o Enterprise's DCF. Retaining DCF is a large component o our long-term approach to enhance our inancial lexibility, provide capital to und growth projects, reduce our need to issue equity (avoiding the associated equity dilution) and provide a margin o sa ety or our limited partners.

The wellbeing and protection o the environment is also a key ocus or Enterprise. Our success depends on the ability to operate in an environmentally responsible manner that does not adversely impact our neighbors, the communities in which we operate or the environment at large. Good environmental stewardship is not just important; it is a way o doing business at Enterprise.

LOOKING FORWARD TO 2015
As we begin 2015, the energy industry is in the midst o another commodity price cycle with lower prices or crude oil, NGLs and natural gas. Producers have announced reductions to their 2015 capital expenditure budgets and de erral o well completions in certain areas. We believe U.S. production o crude oil and NGLs will continue to increase in 2015 and 2016, although at lower levels than previous orecasts. Producers are ocusing their drilling budgets on the most proli ic, core areas o shale plays where they can earn attractive returns on capital. We believe the shale plays closest to the large markets on the U.S. Gul Coast, such as the Eagle Ford and Permian, will provide producers better returns on capital than some o the more geographically remote regions. In previous cycles Enterprise's integrated system o assets, business diversi ication and inancial strength have enabled us to manage and prosper, whether through organic opportunities or acquisitions o quality assets. We believe Enterprise is well positioned or this current cycle as well. We have increased the percentage o gross operating margin derived rom ee-based activities and reduced the amount o direct exposure to commodity prices. We are connected to shale plays where production is expected to increase, such as the Eagle Ford, Permian and Marcellus/Utica. Our system is connected to the expanding U.S. petrochemical and re ining industries that are bene iting rom shale production. With our marine terminals and docks, we provide producers and re iners with access to international markets. Our commercial and operating teams are working hard or new business opportunities and prudently managing our expenses and capital costs. We also enter this cycle with a strong balance sheet, liquidity and distribution coverage. In closing, our inancial objectives continue to ocus on providing our limited partners with consistent distribution growth and an attractive total return on their investment. In 2014, we generated a total annual return o 13.3 percent, assuming the reinvestment o distributions. We are excited about the uture and con ident that our team o dedicated employees will ind and execute new opportunities to add value to our partnership. Finally, we would like to thank our investors or their continuing support as we look orward to 2015.

LANDMARK ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 2014
As a midstream energy company, two o our principal objectives are to provide our energy-producing customers with low assurance or their production and access to the highest valued markets. For our energy-consuming customers, our objective is to provide supply diversi ication, lexibility and reliability. In the context o these objectives, Enterprise had two landmark achievements in 2014 involving ethane and processed condensate. Domestic production o both o these products signi icantly exceeds U.S. demand and historically has had no outlet to international markets. As a result, these products sold at a discounted price, which reduced producers' return on capital and a ected their overall level o drilling activity. We success ully commercialized the world's irst large scale re rigerated ethane export acility, which will be located on the Houston Ship Channel. This acility will provide U.S. producers o ethane access to international markets, including petrochemical plants in Europe, South America and Asia. There is also interest in using U.S. ethane as uel or power generation in Asia and the Caribbean. We have contracted 80 percent o the acility's 200 MBPD o capacity under long-term contracts and expect the acility to be ully contracted by the time it begins operations in 2016. Another signi icant accomplishment o providing producers with access to new markets was our ruling rom the Bureau o Industry and Security ("BIS") or the export processed condensate. Processed condensate can be used as a petrochemical eedstock, a motor uel or or urther re ining. In 2014, a er receiving this ruling we loaded 3.7 million barrels to be exported to markets in Asia and Europe. We are currently modi ying our system to increase our capacity to handle processed condensate or export. In 2015, we expect our customers to export approximately 15 million barrels.

SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
As we grow, we continue to emphasize the importance o sa ety and protecting our environment. Sa ety is our highest priority. We believe sa e and reliable operations are important in assuring the wellbeing o our employees, contractors, neighbors and assets. We rein orce this commitment by investing in our employees and providing them with the

assessing their inancial per ormance. From a GAAP perspective, the revenue streams associated with these make-up rights are de erred until the earlier o (i) the de iciency volumes are shipped, (ii) the contractual make-up period expires or (iii) the pipeline is released rom its per ormance obligation. Since management includes such de erred revenues in non-GAAP gross operating margin, these amounts are deducted in determining GAAP-based operating income. Our consolidated revenues do not re lect any de erred revenues until the conditions or recognizing such revenues are met in accordance with GAAP. Management expects that several o our new pipeline projects, including the ATEX, Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline, will experience periods where shippers are unable to meet their contractual minimum volume commitments during 2015. We anticipate that committed shipper transportation volumes on the ATEX may be negatively impacted by producer drilling programs, including the timing o new production well start-ups in the Marcellus and Utica Shale developments. With respect to the Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline, we expect that ethane rejection in the supply basins served by these pipelines will adversely impact shipper transportation volumes.

We evaluate segment per ormance based on the non-GAAP inancial measure o gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important per ormance measure o the core pro itability o our operations. This measure orms the basis o our internal inancial reporting and is used by our executive management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors bene it rom having access to the same inancial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP inancial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. In total, gross operating margin represents operating income exclusive o (1) depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses, (2) impairment charges, (3) gains and losses attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries and (4) general and administrative costs. As discussed below, gross operating margin includes equity in income o unconsolidated a liates and non-re undable de erred transportation revenues relating to the make-up rights o committed shippers associated with certain pipelines. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net o the adjustments noted above) rom segment revenues, with both segment totals be ore the elimination o intercompany transactions. In accordance with GAAP, intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Gross operating margin is exclusive o other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative e ect o changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Gross operating margin is presented on a 100 percent basis be ore any allocation o earnings to noncontrolling interests. We include equity in income o unconsolidated a liates in our measurement o segment gross operating margin and operating income. Equity investments with industry partners are a signi icant component o our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those o customers and/or suppliers. This method o operation enables us to achieve avorable economies o scale relative to the level o investment and business risk assumed. Many o these businesses per orm supporting or complementary roles to our other midstream business operations. Management includes de erred transportation revenues relating to the make-up rights o committed shippers when reviewing the inancial results o certain major new pipeline projects such as the Texas Express Pipeline and Seaway Pipeline. Certain shippers on these systems did not meet their minimum volume commitments beginning in the ourth quarter o 2013, thus revenues associated with each shipper's make-up rights were de erred in accordance with GAAP. From an internal (and segment) reporting standpoint, management considers the transportation ees paid by committed shippers on major new pipeline projects, including any non-re undable revenues that may be de erred under GAAP related to make-up rights, to be important in

GROSS OPERATING MARGIN

DISTRIBUTABLE CASH FLOW

Our management compares the distributable cash low we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Distributable cash low is an important non-GAAP inancial measure or our limited partners since it serves as an indicator o our success in providing a cash return on investment. Speci ically, this inancial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash lows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distributions. Distributable cash low is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value o a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount o cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash low is net cash lows provided by operating activities.

ADJUSTED EBITDA

Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental inancial measure by our management and external users o our inancial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to assess the inancial per ormance o our assets without regard to inancing methods, capital structures or historical cost basis; the ability o our assets to generate cash su cient to pay interest and support our indebtedness; and the viability o projects and the overall rates o return on alternative investment opportunities. Since adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that a ect net income or loss and because these measures may vary among other companies, the adjusted EBITDA data presented in this Letter may not be comparable to similarly titled measures o other companies. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net cash lows provided by operating activities.
