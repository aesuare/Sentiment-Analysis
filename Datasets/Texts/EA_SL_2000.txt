CHAIRMAN’S LETTER
 TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS
During fiscal year 2000 Electronic Arts (EA) significantly enhanced its strategic position in the interactive entertainment category. While continuing to create the world’s greatest games on current platforms, EA has taken action to capitalize on technology breakthroughs and to help insulate the company from the cyclical economics that historically impact our industry during console transitions. Despite the console market transition beginning sooner than expected, we continued to grow revenues and profits during the year. We reached an important agreement with America Online, Inc. to be the exclusive provider of games on all AOL sites, increased market share on the critical PC platform, and positioned ourselves for leadership on the next generation of console platforms.
By managing the industry’s best development talent, creating strong franchise properties, and expanding our global distribution, we increased revenues and profits in a challenging market environment. Including the results of our new online division, EA.com,(1) consolidated net revenues increased 16 percent to $1,420 million. Consolidated net income, on an as-reported basis, including goodwill and one-time acquisition related charges, increased 60 percent to $117 million; while consolidated diluted earnings per share increased 53 percent to $1.76.

Consolidated pro-forma net income, excluding goodwill and one-time acquisition-related
charges in both years, increased 14 percent to $130 million. Consolidated pro-forma diluted earnings per share(2) increased 8 percent to $1.95. Our core business, which excludes the results of EA.com, grew pro-forma net revenues(3) 16 percent to $1,401 million. Pro-forma core net income(4) increased 37 percent to $164 million for the core business.
 STRONGLY POSITIONED ON KEY PLATFORMS We had multi- ple successes on the PC platform in fiscal year 2000. SimCity 3000TM and Command & ConquerTM: Tiberian SunTM each achieved No. 1 status on the PC best-seller list. For calendar year 1999, both products finished in the Top Ten, representing our best performance ever on the PC platform. In addition, we created an outstanding new franchise property—The SimsTM—which was named Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences.
On the console platforms, our EA SPORTSTM titles maintained a leadership position, with Madden NFLTM 2000 once again winning the all-important football battle in North America.
recent holiday season. We expect to have an ongoing collab- oration with DreamWorks SKG, allowing us to create unique and commercially viable content for the interactive entertain- ment market.
Given this unique combination of assets, we believe that Electronic Arts is well positioned to navigate successfully through the transition to the next generation of console tech- nology. Equally important, we view cyclical transition as an opportunity to strengthen and streamline the company, and to clearly establish EA as the market leader of the future.
INVESTING FOR ONLINE LEADERSHIP While still in its infancy,
FIFA 2000 dominated the European “football” category, with

NBA Live 2000, NHL 2000, NASCAR 2000, Triple Play 2001, Knockout KingsTM 2000 and Tiger Woods PGA TOUR® Golf 2000 all leading in their respective categories. In addition, we bol- stered our impressive motorsports lineup by signing a long- term license with Formula One. In March 2000, we released our first F1 products, rounding out the strongest collection of sports properties in our industry. We also secured an exclu- sive five-year agreement for the James Bond license and will release The World Is Not Enough on multiple platforms in the coming year. In 1999, Tomorrow Never Dies was one of the
02 leading products on the PlayStation® platform.
We further strengthened our Studio organization with the
acquisition of DreamWorks Interactive, LLC. DreamWorks developed and published Jurassic Park: The Lost World and released Medal Of HonorTM, a best-selling title during the most
analysts project that online interactive entertainment will generate revenues of up to $2 billion in 2002, an increase of more than 500 percent from $300 million in 1999. During the year, we made a significant investment in EA.com, which we believe will help to establish us as the leading provider of interactive entertainment in the emerging online market. EA.com pro-forma revenues(1) totaled $21 million in fiscal year 2000, with investment spending of $63 million, resulting in a pro-forma net loss(6) of $34 million. We expect that the online portion of our business will continue to generate a net loss in the coming fiscal year, as we position ourselves for this sig- nificant new opportunity.
In November 1999, we announced a wide-ranging strategic alliance with America Online. The agreement provides Electronic Arts with control of all programming, pricing and promotion on the AOL® games channel. This is an unprece- dented

 dented arrangement, which provides EA with immediate access to nearly 60 million online consumers including 22 million AOL subscribers. We have created a separate class of stock, Class B Common Stock (Tracking Stock), to track the performance of the EA.com business, and plan to take this security public at a later date. AOL owns 10 percent of the Class B Common Stock with a warrant for an additional 5 per- cent ownership. News Corp., as partial consideration for the sale of their Kesmai development group to EA, received 5 percent of the tracking stock. We believe that the partnership with AOL, News Corp., EA Studios and our existing publishing organization is a formidable combination that will facilitate mar- ket leadership in this rapidly growing segment of the Internet.
STRATEGIC GOALS FOR THE FUTURE As we look ahead, we are focused on four strategic initiatives.
First, our goal is to be the market leader on the next generation of video game consoles, which includes Sony’s PlayStation®2 computer entertainment system, Microsoft’s XboxTM, and Nintendo’s Dolphin. We shipped our first product for the PlayStation 2 console in Japan in May 2000. Additional titles will be released beginning in the Fall of 2000 in con- junction with the launch of the PlayStation 2 console in North America and Europe.
Second, our objective is to be the leading publisher world- wide on the PC platform. We currently hold that position in Europe and Asia Pacific and intend to increase our share in fiscal year 2001. In North America, we believe we can move into the leadership position with a strong portfolio of titles that includes The Sims, Command & Conquer: Red AlertTM2, American McGee’s AliceTM, Black & WhiteTM, The World Is Not Enough, and a full line up of EA SPORTS products.
Third, we intend to be the leading provider of interactive entertainment on the Internet. The ability to create compelling
content in our Studios and our new EA.com division, along with the unparalleled distribution and reach provided through our partnership with AOL, uniquely positions us for success in this environment. We plan to launch the EA.comSM site in sum- mer 2000, with the full service operational in calendar 2001.
Fourth, but most importantly, we strive to be the No. 1 “people company” in the entertainment industry. Without doubt, our employees are the lifeblood of our company. They create the award-winning products, market and distribute them more effectively than any competitor, and provide the support functions that enable EA to be the premier company in our industry. It is imperative that our people are well trained, strongly motivated, recognized for their accom- plishments and highly productive. We take this challenge seriously and are constantly working to enhance the quality of our organization.
We have every confidence that we can achieve each of these strategic objectives, and, in doing so, that we will con- tinue to grow and prosper not only during the current console transition period but also in the years ahead.
I would like to acknowledge our employees for their tire- less efforts, commitment to excellence and dedication to making EA the worldwide leader in our industry.
Finally, I thank our customers and stockholders for their continuing support and trust in Electronic Arts.
Sincerely,
Lawrence F. Probst III
