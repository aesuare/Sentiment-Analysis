CROWN

Dear Fellow Shareholders: At Crown, we take pride in the solid achievements in 2003, but recognize that there is more to be done as we continue to improve your Company's performance in 2004 and in the years ahead. This is the third letter which we have written to you, and in doing so we reflected on the dramatic positive changes which have occurred during the period 2001 through 2003. So, before reviewing the specific achievements of 2003, we thought it would be well to remind you of the current state of your Company, compared to early 2001. First, the Company's packaging activities today are sharply focused in two principal areas: metal packaging and plastic closures. We have strong competitive strengths in these packaging arenas, as evidenced by an excellent low cost asset base, broad global coverage in both developed and developing markets, and we believe, the industry's leading research and development capability. Gone from the portfolio are the Company's U.S. and European PET bottle businesses, a fragrance pump business, a pharmaceutical packaging business, a variety of sub-Saharan African bottle cap businesses, a Chinese PET bottle business, and certain South American food can businesses. Selling these businesses raised significant cash which was used to pay down debt and had the strategic benefit of narrowing our focus and enabling us to execute more effectively in the areas where we have true leadership positions. As we speak to you today, strong financial guidelines have been established throughout the Company which enable us to understand clearly whether current and future actions will have a beneficial impact on the financial performance of the Company. Our two primary metrics for performance measurement are economic profit and free cash flow. Economic profit is the concept that all investments and all businesses must earn a return in excess of the cost of our debt and in excess of a return which our shareholders would view as a minimum acceptable return on our equity. By free cash, we mean cash generated above and beyond all day to day business needs which is available to pay down debt. All of our employees understand these concepts and actively use them. Our capital expenditures have been and continue to be carefully reviewed and sparingly committed. We spend only for critical projects which have a high degree of certainty of achieving attractive returns. Our asset base is excellent, reflecting both very significant capital expenditures for modernization and cost reduction in past years and a highly effective ongoing maintenance program. Our working capital is under intense scrutiny, and we have reduced it for three successive years, with an expectation of and strong commitment to further reductions in 2004. We have made extensive management and organizational changes, both in the Americas Division and in the European Division. Today, our management team is highly able, broadly experienced, and functioning together to achieve well defined goals. The team exudes a wellfounded confidence which is the product of significant achievement.

And finally, we have continued to establish and have improved excellent relations with our customers, suppliers, and creditors, and all of our employees understand, support, and enjoy Crown's sustained success. Looking back at 2003, excellent progress was made in the continuing resurgence of the Company. In February 2003, we successfully refinanced and restructured the Company's debt, thereby ensuring a stable capital structure for the future -- one that provides us with permanence and an ability to grow in the years ahead. Since the refinancing, the Company has redeemed and retired early approximately $210 million of senior notes due 2004 through 2006 using available cash flow. Our operating divisions continued to improve their performance in 2003. The Americas Division, after significant improvement in 2002, consolidated their performance and optimized operations to maximize free cash flow during the course of the year. Margin performance in certain of the Division's segments was disappointing, but plans are well underway to improve in 2004. Our European Division had another good year in 2003 and once again improved on the prior year by virtually every measure. Improvements were well beyond the significant reported improvement resulting from the Euro and the Pound Sterling appreciation against the U.S. dollar. The Division clearly benefited from a full year of operations in our new Seville, Spain beverage can plant, opened a new food can plant in Russia supporting our multi-national customers, and announced a new beverage can plant in Tunisia, which will come on stream in 2005. Our Asia-Pacific Division had another excellent year, with sales, operating income and cash flow all showing substantial year on year improvement. Our excellent position, in terms of geographic markets, product lines and asset base, continues to bear fruit. Our customers advise us that they must strengthen brand identity, and Crown is actively assisting them to do so. Our leading research and development centers have provided a rich source of new products addressing our customers' needs. We continued to have great success selling our new SuperEndTM beverage ends into the marketplace; we lead the industry in shaped can technology; we introduced a new generation of vacuum closures which we refer to as our family of IdealTM closures; and, we rolled out new full pull-off ends (EOLE IIITM and Peel SeamTM) for a variety of foods and beverages. Our customer relations have never been better and our focus on our customers and their needs has resulted in strengthened positions for Crown throughout the world. No other company in our industry exhibits our range of product and process capabilities, and our customers, we believe, appreciate our creativity and reward us for it.

We are thankful for the dedication and effort of all of our employees throughout the world. Good people have done great things and will continue to do so. There are a number of changes in the Board of Directors since our last letter to you. John Neff, having reached the Board's mandatory retirement age of 72, will not stand for reelection at the 2004 annual meeting. We thank John for his service to the Company, and his wise counsel and steady hand during some difficult times. We wish him well in the future. We welcome to the Board William Little and Fred DiBona. Both gentlemen are highly experienced businessmen, and we are delighted that they have agreed to serve on the Board to which they have already made significant contributions. As we look forward, we intend to continue on our current course. That is, we will manage your Company's assets and businesses to maximize free cash flow and improve economic profit. Our financial discipline and dedication to clearly understood performance metrics will not waver. We will also continue to maintain operational excellence, exhibited, among other things, by industry leading manufacturing performance, product quality, and innovation. Future investments will continue to be carefully considered and focused on growing with our customers and taking advantage of profit enhancing opportunities in our many global markets. We are confident that your Company's future is bright, and we thank you for your support.

Sincerely,

John W. Conway Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer March 11, 2004
