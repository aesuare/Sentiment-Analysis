Chairman’s Message
2000 was a watershed year for U. S. Steel. Nearly two decades after the company began closing and consolidating facilities to adjust to the changing economics of steelmaking, U. S. Steel is once again a global steelmaker. At the end of November, the company completed the acquisition of the steel operations and related assets of VSZ a.s. in the Slovak Republic. Renamed after its home city, U. S. Steel Kosice is a modern, ISO 9001 certified, 100 percent continuously cast steel plant, located within a 500-mile radius of dozens of our customers’ plants. With annual production capabilities of four million tons, U. S. Steel Kosice represents about 25 percent of our expanded raw steel capacity of 16.8 million tons.
U. S. Steel’s globalization decisions are based on several strategic objectives: to support our U.S. customers as they expand globally, to broaden the company’s customer base, to target emerging markets where demand for value-added consumer goods is rising, and to provide favorable returns for our shareholders. The formation of U. S. Steel Kosice supports these objectives, and we believe it will have a positive impact on our 2001 results.
We began the year with high expectations. The economy was strong, and automobile and appliance production were at record levels. Sales volumes for our sheet products were improving, increased energy prices were creating greater demand for our tubular products and we announced several price increases in an attempt to bring pricing back to the pre-crisis levels of 1997.
At mid-year, however, things began to change. Imports were at near-record levels, customers started to reduce inventory, the economy began to soften, natural gas prices skyrocketed, and sales volumes and prices declined sharply. By the end of the year, spot market steel prices had dropped to unprecedented levels. We also faced unexpected production problems at both of our coal mines and unstable operations at our Fairfield Works’ blast furnace.
The skyrocketing cost of natural gas had a significant impact on our results. By year-end 2000, natural gas prices had more than tripled, adding costs of approximately $70 million over 1999. Natural gas is used in most aspects of steelmaking, from the stoves that generate hot air for the blast furnace, to the reheat furnaces in the hot strip mill, to the coating process used to make corrosion resistant sheets. Through conservation, improved efficiency and the increased use of alternative and by-product fuels, such as coke-oven and blast furnace gas, we are striving to reduce our dependence on natural gas.
While the dramatic increase in natural gas prices wreaked havoc on the cost of making steel, it also spurred exploration, drove up the drilling rig count from a 50-year low of 494 in April 1999 to more than 1,100 at year-end 2000, and created strong demand for our tubular products. As a result, the performance of our tubular business, which suffered in 1999 due to a glut of oil, improved year over year.
For the year 2000, the company recorded a net loss of $21 million on revenues of $6.1 billion, compared to net income of $44 million on revenues of $5.5 billion in 1999.
For the third year in a row, the steel industry was affected by an enormous volume of dumped and subsidized foreign steel. Imports were 37.8 million tons in 2000, the second highest annual level in history.
U. S. Steel, as part of an industry-labor coalition, pursued remedies under our trade laws to stem the flow of unfairly traded imported steel, most recently by filing trade cases against hot rolled carbon steel from 11 countries. We won our trade cases against small and large diameter seamless pipe and cut-to-length plate; however, we were not successful in our trade cases against cold rolled carbon steel. In November, U. S. Steel and other steelmakers, suppliers, trade associations and unions asked the

President to take immediate action to stop the flood of foreign steel which has, since 1998, forced 11 steel companies to file for bankruptcy protection. The Clinton Administration’s response was disappointing. We look forward to working with the Bush Administration to develop meaningful trade legislation and are encouraged by Commerce Secretary Donald Evans’ expressed commitment to enforce our trade laws.
The impact of the ongoing steel crisis has affected all of our operations. U. S. Steel has seven blast furnaces at our domestic plants – four at Gary (Ind.) Works, two at Mon Valley (Pa.) Works and one at Fairfield (Ala.) Works. At year-end, six were operating at reduced levels, and the seventh, the No. 4 blast furnace at Gary Works, had been idled since July. Gary Works also temporarily idled one of its continuous casters. Minntac, our iron mine in Minnesota, idled an agglomerator line that accounts for 12 percent of its production of taconite pellets. Fairless Works, our finishing mill near Philadelphia, dramatically reduced production of cold reduced and coated sheet. Our domestic raw steel production for the year fell to 11.4 million tons, or 89 percent of capability compared to 12 million tons, or 94 percent of capability in 1999. Domestically, we shipped 10.8 million tons of steel products, less than we had hoped as we entered the year.
Investment in our facilities remained focused on cost reduction, productivity, quality and environmental compliance. In 2000, we completed the installation of the three new downcoilers on Gary Works’ hot strip mill. The new coilers improve the mill’s capability of producing heavy gage coiled plate. Gary Works also completed modifications to the Q-BOP shop which allow it to produce the low-carbon/low-nitrogen steel valued by automakers for its strength and formability. Mon Valley Works installed two new BOP steelmaking vessels in the Edgar Thomson plant – which celebrated 125 years of operation in 2000 – and finished upgrading the controls for the Irvin plant’s cold reduction mill. Fairfield Works upgraded the air emissions systems in the blast furnace casthouse and the steelmaking shop.
Joint ventures continued to be an important part of our business strategy in 2000. In response to the growing Mexican automotive and appliance manufacturing base, we have doubled the size of our Acero Prime joint venture processing center. This 130,000-square-foot facility is located in the central Mexican state of San Luis Potosi. In Ramos Arizpe, near Monterrey, we have built a complementary 70,000-square-foot logistical center to store and manage inventories for customers.
In October 2000, U. S. Steel announced its intention to acquire LTV Corporation’s tin operations. Following a delay caused by LTV’s bankruptcy filing, the transaction was completed at the end of February 2001. We expect the acquisition to generate significant synergies for our tin business.
During the year, U. S. Steel introduced several new business systems designed to improve our position as a business partner with our customers. Among them is an enhanced Extranet, an Internet tool that enables our customers to electronically interface with our sales organization and our plants throughout the entire order entry and production process. We also implemented a supply chain management tool that improves inventory management, production scheduling and cash flow for our customers and us. We lead the industry in this new approach to e-commerce.
In 2000, we improved safety performance by 5 percent over 1999, and have instituted several programs, including using employee safety teams for audits, training and interventions, to help us achieve further gains.
We are well on our way to achieving our goal of having all our plants registered under the ISO 14001 international environmental management standard by the end of 2002. Gary Works, Mon Valley Works and PRO-TEC will be registered by the end of this year.
In November, the USX Board of Directors authorized management to retain financial, tax and legal advisors to perform an in-depth study of its targeted stock structure (USX-U. S. Steel Group Common Stock and USX-Marathon Group Common Stock) and all alternative structures which may be in the best interest of shareholders. The study will take several months to complete. The advisors will report their findings and recommendations to the USX Board of Directors, who will review them to determine what actions to take. The Board, in turn, will notify all USX shareholders of the outcome of its review of the findings and recommendations.
Looking ahead, economists predict a 3 percent average growth in the U.S. economy for the current year, most of it occurring in the second half. With a relatively sound economy, steel shipments should improve and we could see modest increases in steel prices later in the year. However, we expect imports to continue to have a negative effect on volume and price in our industry.
Our approach during the economic recovery of the domestic steel industry will be to spend conservatively on capital improvements, to cut costs aggressively and to focus on improving our competitiveness.
In Europe, we will use U. S. Steel Kosice to expand our relationships with global customers. Our investments there will focus primarily on developing the value-added products and services customers have come to expect from U. S. Steel.
On February 25, 2001, U. S. Steel celebrated the 100th anniversary of its incorporation. In 1901, the company was capitalized at $1.4 billion – equal to about $80 billion today – and became the world’s largest corporation. The steel industry of the time was described in terms that apply today – “cutthroat and chaotic.” U. S. Steel’s solution to the problem then included consolidating businesses and moving closer to the customer.
While consolidation on the scale that occurred in 1901 is not possible today, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand domestically and globally. We believe it will take focused growth for U. S. Steel and its employees, customers and shareholders, to prosper in the global economy.
