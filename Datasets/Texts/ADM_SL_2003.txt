Shareholder Letter

During the past decade, we have built strong positions in the leading agricultural producing and consuming regions of the world. Building on our strengths in the agricultural markets of North America and Europe, we are now a leader in the development of the growing markets of South America and China. This combination of developed and emerging market strengths has created unparalleled diversification on a global scale. Linking our network of agribusinesses together with our sound financial position enables us to manage challenging business conditions and allows us to capitalize on a wide range of opportunities for growth. This fiscal year underscored the basic value of ADM's global franchise. Reduced crop production in North America lowered the operating results of our oilseeds, wheat and agricultural services divisions. Despite these adverse conditions, operating profits, excluding unusual items, improved for the year. Across the Company we accelerated initiatives to reduce costs and cash flow remained strong. Consistent with our disciplined approach toward capital expenditures and acquisitions, we strengthened our leadership in the production of corn sweeteners and ethanol in North America. We increased our sourcing and processing of oilseeds in South America. We realigned our oilseeds and wheat processing capacities with reductions in North America and additions in Europe. We expanded our customer relationships by moving up the food chain to provide higher-valued products and services. We invested in new technologies, introduced new products, and worked diligently to meet our customers' requirements. ADM was recognized this past year for its commitment to exemplary corporate governance practices. We also received awards for our excellence in providing food and nutritional ingredients to our customers and were selected as a leader among those companies that provide agricultural commodities to the food industry.
