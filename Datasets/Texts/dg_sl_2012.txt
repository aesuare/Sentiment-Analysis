      To Our Fellow Shareholders, Customers and Employees
Serving our customers by helping them Save time. Save money. Every day! has never been more important than it was throughout 2012 and remains today. Dollar General is serving more customers in more markets than ever before, and we continue to see significant opportunities to grow. Our fiscal 2012 financial performance once again set new records as we worked to fulfill our mission of “Serving Others,” including our shareholders, our customers and our employees.
Highlights of 2012 include the following:
• Net sales increased 8.2% to $16.02 billion, or $216 per square foot. Excluding the 53rd week in 2011, net sales increased 10.4%.
• Same-store sales grew 4.7%, marking our 23rd consecutive year of same-store sales growth.
• Operating profit increased 11% to $1.66 billion, or 10.3% of sales, setting a new record operating profit rate.
• Net income increased 24% to $953 million, and earnings per diluted share increased 28% to $2.85.
• Operating activities generated $1.13 billion of cash flows, which we primarily used to invest in growth for the future and to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases.
• We opened 625 new stores, remodeled or relocated 592 stores, and opened two new distribution centers, ending the year with 10,506 stores in 40 states supported by 11 distribution centers across the U.S.
• As part of our ongoing share repurchase program, we repurchased 14.4 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $671.4 million in 2012.
• We also made significant progress on optimizing our capital structure by refinancing the remainder of our high interest rate debt in July 2012, reducing future interest expense and strengthening our financial position.
We are very pleased with our financial performance as well as our continued progress toward building for the future. Our successful business model is based on meeting the everyday needs of a broad base of customers, and helping them make the most of their spending dollars by offering a wide selection of quality items at value prices in conveniently located easy-to-shop stores. Our core customer, most often a woman, is typically responsible for maintaining a household on a tight budget and is
often underserved by other retailers. We see this as our opportunity to help make her life better every day, and, as evidenced by 23 consecutive years of same-store sales growth, our customers recognize our efforts.
In 2012, customers responded with enthusiasm to our new merchandising initiatives and improvements in our stores. We continued to improve our merchandise in-stock levels and enhance our category management processes which help us determine the most productive merchandise for our customers. For example, in 2012, we expanded the number of coolers for refrigerated and frozen foods in approximately 1,400 existing stores, made further progress on our beer and wine rollout and implemented successful new initiatives in our home products offerings. Customers are increasingly relying on Dollar General for their consumables needs, so we are testing other slightly larger store formats that offer more perishable food items. We’ve also continued to expand our private brands in consumables and are especially pleased with the success of our proprietary Rexall brand in healthcare products.
Daily, over 90,000 Dollar General employees are working hard to serve our customers in communities across the U.S. In 2012, we implemented new training and development programs and we further utilized our new workforce management system to help our store managers more effectively manage their stores. As a result, our store manager retention has improved, our store productivity has increased and store labor costs as a percentage of sales have decreased while improving our customer’s overall shopping experience.
Dollar General is positioned to have another great year in 2013. We have a strong foundation for growth that we built together as a team. I have confidence that we can successfully execute our 2013 plans and continue to deliver long-term sustainable returns for our shareholders through earnings growth and ongoing share repurchases.
Kindest regards,
Richard W. Dreiling
