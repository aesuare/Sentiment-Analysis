Dear Stockholder
By many measures, fiscal 2007 was perhaps the most challenging of the 40 years that Toll Brothers has been in business. Although 1974 was tough, those difficult times lasted only one year. Confronted with a severe housing downturn, our team still produced FY 2007 revenues of $4.6 billion and net income of $35.7 million, which, although down significantly from FY 2006, was our 22nd consecutive year of profitability. At FYE 2007, stockholders' equity grew to $3.53 billion, and our net debt-to-capital ratio* stood at 26.8%, its lowest level ever. However, after 85 consecutive profitable quarters since going public in 1986, we reported our first quarterly loss ever. This fourth-quarter loss of $0.52 per share was driven by $315 million of pre-tax write-downs. Before writedowns, fourth-quarter net income was $118 million, or $0.72 per share, (for the full FY 2007 it was $464.6 million or $2.83 per share, before write-downs); however, the fact that we took such substantial write-downs in the fourth quarter, on top of the nearly $488 million of pre-tax write-downs in the previous four quarters, reflects the lack of demand we face in the current market. With FY 2007 contracts of $3.01 billion and a year-end backlog of $2.85 billion, down 33% and 36% respectively from one year ago, we expect that revenues in FY 2008 will be below those of FY 2007. It's not a matter of if, but a matter of when, this oversupply will be absorbed. Then we should return to better times. We believe those who wanted to buy but didn't will kick themselves for their reticence. However, the biggest hurdle for our clients right now is their concern about selling their existing homes. For our buyers, who typically have very strong credit scores and are borrowing at lower leverage ratios than the average new home buyer, obtaining a mortgage does not appear to be a problem; however, it probably is a concern for our buyers' buyers. From what we have observed in previous downturns, we believe builders with reputations for dependability, quality, and financial strength have a competitive advantage. In a tough market, our brand name and reputation should distinguish us. The experience we have gained navigating through previous downturns has taught us to focus on ensuring ourselves adequate financial liquidity. At FYE 2007 we had more than $1.2 billion available and unused under our bank credit facility, which expires in March 2011. This, combined with our over $900 million in cash, gave us more than $2.1 billion of available liquidity. In addition, we have no maturities on our $1.5 billion of outstanding public debt until 2011, and its average maturity is 5.6 years as of FYE 2007. We have continued to renegotiate and in some cases reduce our optioned land positions. We ended FY 2007 with approximately 59,300 lots owned and optioned, down 35% compared to approximately 91,200 at the peak at second-quarter end of FY 2006. We ended the year with 315 selling communities, down from the peak of 325 at second-quarter end, and expect to be selling from approximately 300 communities by FYE 2008.

We believe that motivated sellers, excess supply, and low interest rates make now an attractive time to buy a home, but weak consumer confidence continues to buck these positives. Broader concerns about the nation's economy have magnified worries about potential price declines in the housing market. These worries were reflected in our buyer cancellation rates, which escalated in FY 2007 to 26% of FY 2007 gross contracts, compared to 17% in FY 2006 and our previous historical average of about 7%.

We also have streamlined our staffing operation to better match our reduced production. Unfortunately, we've had experience at this, having worked through the major downturns that began in 1974, 1980, and 1988. Even so, we have maintained active deal teams in most of our regions that are working hard to identify opportunities that may arise from dislocations in the market. While we remain attuned to the need to proceed cautiously and prudently given the difficulty of predicting the end of the current downturn, we do recall the opportunities that emerged from the downturn of the early 1990s and intend to be well-positioned in anticipation of the eventual recovery. This downturn may be our toughest test yet, but we believe our great team is up to the challenge. We still believe the demographics exist to support the housing market. Pent-up demand should be building. Immigration is at record levels and large amounts of wealth have been created. With interest rates still quite low and very few new home sites moving through the approval process, as soon as the fear of dropping home prices dissipates, we may witness a faster and stronger recovery than anticipated. We wish to thank our stockholders, suppliers, and contractors for their support; our customers for their trust; and our co-workers for their enthusiasm, perseverance, and dedication to making our Company the best in the industry.
