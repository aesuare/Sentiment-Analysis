TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
 David Nelms
Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer
Over the past year and a half, what began as a problem with subprime mortgages in the United States has grown into a broader downturn affecting the global economy. Current negative trends now include rising unemployment, declining housing prices, restricted availability of credit, reduced consumer spending, and low consumer and business confidence. These conditions have affected Discover and other financial institutions, as well as our cardmembers and merchants.
During these turbulent times, Discover has distinguished itself by maintaining a conservative approach to capital, liquidity and credit. Our business model has less leverage and complexity than more diversified financial services firms, which has helped us stay focused on our core business. Overall, I believe we are well positioned
to manage through the economic cycle, serve our customers and seize new opportunities.
2008 Results
Discover produced solid financial results in a challenging economic environment this past year:
• Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 9% to $2.20 (including $1.11 per share from the first payment of our Visa/MasterCard settlement, discussed on page 38).
• Discover Card sales volume totaled $92 billion, and total managed loans reached $51 billion, up 6% year-over-year.
• Our full-year managed net charge-off rate was 5%, below the average of other major credit card issuers.
• Total volume on our networks increased 19% to $221 billion (including $13 billion from Diners Club International).
• We grew deposits by 15% to $29 billion.
• We continued to build liquidity and capital, ending the year
with tangible equity of $11.37 per share.

                Discover also made a number of strategic moves in 2008 with an eye toward the future:
• We sold our U.K. credit card issuing business, which significantly reduced our funding and earnings risk and improved our
capital ratios.
• We acquired Diners Club International, which has an acceptance network in 185 countries and territories around the world.
The acquisition provides us with new international partnerships
and volume, plus a path to global acceptance of Discover Network cards for the first time.
• We improved domestic acceptance. Our new U.S. acceptance model is in the final stages of implementation, and we will work to take advantage of expanded acceptance in 2009.
• We continued to enhance our industry leading rewards programs, focusing on innovations to help cardmembers earn better rewards and to increase the value of those rewards upon redemption.
• We proactively engaged with our cardmembers who were experiencing financial stress, and we provided innovative new tools to help Discover Cardmembers spend smarter, manage their debt better and save more.
Beyond our financial and operating results, the people of Discover continued to demonstrate our commitment to the communities where we live and work. In 2008, our employees donated more than 35,000 hours of time and made financial contributions to more than 3,000 nonprofit organizations. I am very proud of the enthusiasm and social responsibility our employees demonstrate each and every day.

Recent Developments
In January 2009, Discover received preliminary approval to participate in the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program.
We expect to issue and sell to the U.S. Treasury shares of preferred stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock for $1.2 billion. The additional capital, along with funding from our growing consumer deposits business, will enable us to increase
our on-balance sheet loans. In connection with participating
in the Capital Purchase Program, Discover expects to become
a bank holding company.
We are also beginning to implement the comprehensive new rules on credit card practices and disclosures that were adopted by the Federal Reserve Board in December 2008, and will take effect in July 2010. The rules will require significant systems and operational changes in the credit card industry, and they have the potential for a negative impact on net interest margin. However, we are embracing these new rules and working to implement them.
Looking Ahead
We expect the economic downturn to continue through 2009. We will face that challenge by continuing our conservative approach to capital, liquidity and funding; proactively managing our credit quality and
loan growth; and continuing to grow our global payments business.
As indicated on the cover of this year’s annual report, we will also stay focused on building rewarding relationships with our cardmembers, merchants and issuers; providing superior customer service; retaining and developing talented people; and living the Discover Values.

Finally, I want to thank Discover customers, employees, shareholders and Board members for their continued support.
In particular, I thank Dennis D. Dammerman for serving as Discover’s Chairman in our first 18 months as a stand-alone public company. The experience of Discover’s strong and independent Board of Directors is of significant value to the company. With their counsel, we will continue to focus on helping customers and our company manage through the current economic downturn and emerge to a brighter financial future.
