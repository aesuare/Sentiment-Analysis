                                                    2010 AnnuAl RepoRt
   Dear Fellow ShareholDer:
i am pleased to report that 2010 was an outstanding year of execution at Danaher. aided by the global economic recovery, our team took full advantage of the opportunities for growth to deliver exceptional results, all the while evolving the portfolio toward a more global, higher quality, more scientific and technological set of businesses.
MeaSUrING SUCCeSS
one of the core tenets of the Danaher Business System (DBS) is “if you don’t measure it, you can’t improve it.” for more than 20 years, DBS has provided our associates the necessary tools to measure performance, as we serve our customers. this results-driven approach to running our business has served us well over the long-term with consistently strong financial performance and improvements in every aspect of our business.
a year ago, i reported to you the good work our team was doing to drive innovation, to expand our customer facing initiatives, to increase our exposure in the fast growing emerging markets and to evolve our portfolio through acquisitions. in 2010, we continued to focus our time in these critical areas with measurable success.
2010 Financial Highlights
• We delivered record revenues of $13.2 billion with core revenue growth of 11.5%
• Our gross margin exceeded 50% for the first time in Danaher’s history
• We exceeded $1.8 billion in free cash flow, surpassing our previous all-time high achieved in 2008
• We generated a free cash flow to net income conversion ratio of 120%, excluding the gain from the apex joint venture, representing the 19th consecutive year in which free cash flow exceeded net income
• Adjusted diluted net earnings per share increased more than 30% to $2.31
• We deployed over $2 billion of capital to acquire 19 new companies across all of our five segments, with an emphasis on our growth platforms
• Our market capitalization surpassed $30 billion

  New Product Development
investing in innovation is an important part of the Danaher growth story. More than 6% of our annual sales are now directed to research and development (r&D) initiatives; nearly double what it was just a few years ago. this is very much a deliberate reallocation of resources on our part. using accelerated Product Development and other DBS tools, we are bringing innovative new products to market faster than ever with measurable
results – $3.5 billion of our revenue in 2010 came from products introduced within the last 36 months. In 2010 alone, we launched over 1,800 new products, including:
• Trojan Technologies introduced the TrojanUV Signa, its most advanced, open channel wastewater uv disinfection system designed for large-scale disinfection applications. it makes the conversion to uv disinfection easier, by reducing the total footprint needed, simplifying maintenance and lowering the total cost of ownership.
• Fluke’s new 381 Remote Display Clamp Meter is the first of its kind with a detachable, remote display and flexible current probe, providing technicians with easier, faster and safer measurements.
• Leica Microsystems launched the M320 microscope, designed for the dental practitioner and developed using open innovation with Kavo.
• Veeder-Root launched the Phase-TwoTM Water Detector, the first and only solution to continuously monitor underground storage tanks and detect ethanol-blended fuel phase separation, which can occur when water finds its way into the tanks, often leading to infrastructure corrosion at the service station and costly damage to vehicle engines.
                  raDIoMeTer
radiometer launched the aBl90 flEX blood gas analyzer targeting mid-volume point-of-care testing in clinical applications and the ABL80 flEX designed for the emerging markets. Shortly after launch, the aBl90 was awarded the medical Design Excellence award for in-vitro diagnostics.

     aB SciEX tripletofTM 5600 SySTeM
The australian Proteome analysis Facility (“aPaF”) has chosen the
aB SCIeX TripleToFTM 5600 System to help advance proteomics research, by significantly expanding its proteome coverage. The TripleToFTM 5600 System is the life science industry’s fastest and most sensitive, high-resolution mass spectrometer for high-performance qualitative and quantitative analysis. aPaF is among the first laboratories in the world to adopt this groundbreaking scientific technology. aPaF’s core proteomic services are focused on differential protein expression analysis, which drives the search for biomarkers that can be used to improve human health, agriculture and food research. The TripleToFTM 5600 System will enable aPaF scientists to characterize which proteins are changing within a biological system with much greater depth and accuracy than what they can currently achieve with existing systems.

            DaNaher IN ChINa
in 2010 and for the first time, we had four brands – fluke, Hach, Leica and Tektronix – surpass $100 million of in-country china sales. this is a significant achievement for Danaher and a testament to the strength of the local chinese leadership team and associates.
         Emerging Markets
We continue to focus many of our investments in the emerging markets to accelerate our growth in these fast growing regions of the world. in 2010 we expanded our associate base in the emerging markets by nearly 14% with particular emphasis on sales & marketing and research & development functions. Dynamic resource allocation is helping us target our investments to have the highest impact in geographies and functions that best serve our customers.
These investments are paying off with core revenue growth in the emerging markets greater than 20% in 2010. In China core revenues grew in excess of 30%. The growth model we have developed in China is being aggressively exported around the world, most notably to india, which we believe will be a significant contributor to our long-term growth. India has grown from just $25 million in revenues five years ago to nearly $200 million today. While most of our growth in India has been organic, Gilbarco veeder-root expanded its reach in india in 2010 with the acquisition of larsen & toubro limited’s Petroleum Dispensing Pumps & Systems Business, a leader in retail petroleum equipment technology for the indian and other emerging markets. this is Danaher’s first acquisition in india and underlines our commitment to expand our presence in the region.
other emerging markets also are ripe with opportunity. radiometer is expanding its presence in Eastern Europe to meet the demand from hospitals for point-of-care ready instrumentation. in 2010 they reorganized their go-to-market approach in turkey by shifting from a distribution structure to a direct sales model. Within the first six months of this change, Radiometer’s market share in Turkey went from 10% to over 20%, and the business saw a 100% increase in the sales funnel. They are now looking to other geographies that would benefit from a similar approach.

       HACH VIRTUAL TRADeSHOW
in 2010 hach held a virtual tradeshow which provides customers with innovative, online access to information and experts without the travel and time commitment of attending a traditional tradeshow. using the online tool, customers interact with hach subject matter experts through video demonstrations, webex and live chats. the virtual tradeshow requires a similar level of investment from hach, but is generating more than three times the average number of leads compared to a traditional show. customers are spending on average one to two hours visiting the virtual show – far longer than at a traditional show. Due to the success of hach’s virtual tradeshows other Danaher opcos are also adopting this innovative way to market to their customers.
    Go-to-Market Initiatives
the internet is changing the way all of us conduct business. over the past several years, we have seen a dramatic shift in the way our customers behave, relying less on traditional media and trade shows and more on the web. as a result, we are rapidly transforming the way we build our brands, the way we generate leads and the way we interact with our customers via the web. We have developed DBS tools specifically geared toward digital marketing to make sure we are capturing as many opportunities as we can via the web. our businesses are embracing the forum, using tools such as search engine optimization (SEo) to ensure that customers can easily find our products using popular search engines sites such as Google and yahoo.
at fluke, SEo contributed to a doubling of its
search-based web traffic in 2010.
              PelToN & CraNe
Pelton & crane developed Driven to Excellence, an interactive, two-day, dental office design seminar, to address the needs of dentists building out their operatory rooms. the program is led by dentists, for dentists with Pelton & crane sales associates consulting on how their technology can be a key element and enabler in an operatory build-out. During the last 18 months, Pelton & Crane has had over 750 dentists attend the seminar, resulting in a $50 million sales funnel; an increase of more than 70% compared to before the program was launched.
       all the while, our commitment to more
traditional go-to-market activities remains
intact. We continue to invest heavily in a variety of sales force initiatives with a goal of optimizing face-to-face selling time with our customers and, in turn, driving growth.
Portfolio Evolution
Danaher continues to be an active acquirer of great, global companies with strong, market-leading brands.
We spent approximately $2 billion on 19 strategically important transactions in 2010, the largest of which was

the acquisition of aB SciEX and molecular Devices which closed in January 2010.

    We acquired five Test & Measurement businesses throughout the year, including Keithley instruments, a leader in advanced electrical test instruments and systems, to complement and accelerate tektronix’s bench-top position.
in 2010 we also capitalized on other strategic opportunities to create shareholder value. We formed Apex Tool Group,
a joint venture with cooper industries, which combines
the Danaher Tool Group and Cooper’s tool businesses. We also announced in January 2011 the divestiture of Pacific Scientific Aerospace to Meggitt PLC. We believe that both transactions help drive the long-term value creation that we envision for our associates, customers and shareholders.
The Best Team Wins
critical to all that we do is our talented team of leaders
and associates. it is their hard work and dedication that
has led to our success. We’re equally committed to their
development so that we can be sure we have the next
generation of leaders ready to take Danaher even further. We are confident that we have the right team in place to fulfill our vision of building a premier global enterprise.
FINal ThoUGhTS
We continue to evolve our portfolio toward a more global, higher growth, more scientific and technological set of businesses, where our brands are market leaders. our outstanding execution and the investments we have made in innovation, go-to-market initiatives and emerging markets have driven superior results. as this evolution continues, we are still very much committed to generating excellent free cash flow and deploying that cash back into the businesses. With DBS providing the inventory of growth and cost tools, our results are sustainable and we believe we are well positioned to outperform again in 2011.
  We are grateful for your continuing support.
