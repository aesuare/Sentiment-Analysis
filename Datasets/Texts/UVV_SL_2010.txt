TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Fiscal year 2010, like 2009, was an excellent year for the Company. We achieved record earnings of $168 million, up 28% from the $132 million we earned in fiscal year 2009. Operations in fiscal year 2009 were strong, but our performance was overshadowed by the recognition of currency-related costs due to the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the period. In November 2009, we raised our dividend for the 39th consecutive year, and during the last two fiscal years, we repurchased common shares worth over $140 million.
In fiscal year 2010, we achieved our goals of increasing earnings per share, generating economic profit, maintaining our strong financial position, and effectively managing our remeasurement and other currency-related risks. The strong performance of each of our regional operations enabled us to meet those goals. It is truly remarkable for all regions to do well in a single year given the unpredictable nature of the many factors that can affect short-term performance, such as weather conditions, customer shipment timing, supplier delivery timing, and logistics in many regions. Delays in shipments from Africa and North America this year had a significant effect on earnings and revenues through the first three quarters of the year. As expected, we experienced a significant catch up in shipments in the fourth quarter although some remain to be completed in fiscal year 2011. Our Asian trading business also posted gains on volume increases this year. Our dark tobacco business had tough comparisons. As we told you last year, we saw increased shipments in the United States in fiscal year 2009 in anticipation of the CHIP excise tax. In addition, our factory in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was shut down for a portion of the year for its expansion and upgrade. That factory is now back in service and running well. The reduction in U.S. interest rates helped lower our interest costs by $11 million for the fiscal year.

The industry environment over the last several years has become more complex with continued focus on potential regulation driving quality requirements, perhaps most notably by the FDA in the United States. In addition, green tobacco costs in the developing world have escalated rapidly, while our customers continue to face intense global competition as well as decreasing consumption in some markets. We will focus on fundamentals in fiscal year 2011 so that we can help our customers prepare for increased regulation while addressing their cost control requirements.
As we have reported to you, we see a recurrent theme of some manufacturers wanting to get closer to tobacco farmers for many stated reasons, including political considerations and potential regulatory compliance. In response, we are working to achieve effective changes in our business model that are likely to include more structured dealings with the manufacturers, customized to meet their needs. We welcome those changes and continue to dedicate our efforts to providing workable business models for all of our customers.
We have also seen an increased customer focus on costs. For example, we expect that the contracts for our toll processing business in the United States will be renewed at lower volumes and under different terms when they expire in May 2011. We will work hard to replace that volume with business that aligns profitability with risk, and we will take the necessary steps to remain competitive in the market. Our goal is to deliver our products and services at the lowest reasonable cost to our customers, consistent with high quality standards. But we also believe our prices must provide a fair return on the capital required to sustain the business and be equitable across the market.

We take our customers’ requirements for quality and security of supply very seriously. Sustainability is critical to our customers, and we believe that we are in the best position in the industry to reliably provide high quality products at a reasonable cost. We intend to continue to meet our customers’ needs and deliver adequate returns to our shareholders, and we believe that we will be successful for several key reasons:
• We add value for our customers by providing a clearinghouse for the various grades of tobacco found in every crop. Most of our customers do not utilize the entire run of the crop, so we provide them with a selection of the qualities they need for their blends.
• We are experts in both sourcing and processing tobacco and are committed to good agricultural practices.
• We believe that we are the low cost producer of high quality products, and we plan to remain in that position.
• Through our professional dealings with farmers, our processing standards, and our global reach, we provide stability of supply and quality assurances to our customers.
• We are accountable to our shareholders and expect to make a reasonable return on our business investments commensurate with the degree of risk involved.
• We recognize that, to be successful, we must constantly improve and adapt our business model.
• We are financially strong and are well positioned to succeed in today’s challenging environment.
