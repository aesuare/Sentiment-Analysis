City National Corporation
2007 Summary annual Report
PAGE 1
To our Shareholders
in 2007, challenging national economic conditions triggered by the subprime mortgage debacle tested the financial services industry, forcing some large companies to write off billions of dollars, a process that is not over yet. These challenges underscored City National’s fundamental strength, successful business model and ability to profitably weather economic difficulties.
let’s look at where City National is today: City National is a well-capitalized, double-a rated company in the top 1 percent of U.S. banks. it has steered clear of the many highly publicized problems that are affecting some other banks. We do not have subprime loans or exposure to subprime collateralized debt obligations. We have no concerns over auto loans, credit card debt or home equity loans. City National’s balance sheet is strong, backed by abundant capital and liquidity. The company’s deposit base is exceptional, and its credit quality is sound.
in its 2007 Bank performance Scorecard, Bank Director magazine ranked City National 10th among the country’s 150 largest banks and thrifts. The scorecard (run by the investment bank of Sandler o’Neill+ partners, l.p.) evaluated each company’s performance by a number of important criteria, including return on equity, return on assets, capitalization and asset quality. last year was the third consecutive year that City National has ranked among the top 10.
last year, even in the face of a slowing economy, City National grew its assets, revenue, loans, average deposits, fee income and assets under management. in 2007, the company earned $222.7 million on record

City National is a double-a rated company in the top 1 percent of U.S. banks.
revenue of $911.5 million. Earnings per share totaled $4.52, a 3 percent decline from 2006, placing City National’s earnings performance in the top one-third of the nation’s 50 largest banks.
loan growth was strong in every major category. average loans grew to $11.1 billion, up 11 percent from 2006. it’s important to note that City National does not make – and does not buy – subprime or option adjustable rate mortgage loans.
Credit quality is sound. Net loan charge-offs were $8.5 million. our company is adequately reserved at 1.45 percent of total loans, which is a higher level of reserves than almost all of our peer banks.
of course, the housing construction business weakened last year as a direct result of the problems in the mortgage industry. However, City National’s for-sale housing construction portfolio with our real estate clients accounts for about 5 percent of the company’s total loans, and most of our construction lending is in California’s strongest and most prosperous counties.
City National’s other residential real estate-related portfolio – home mortgages – is performing extremely well as usual. in fact, the company has never foreclosed on a home mortgage loan that it originated. Virtually all of our home mortgage borrowers are our private banking clients, and City National’s average loan-to-value ratio is just over 50 percent at origination.
in 2007, average deposits exceeded $12 billion – a 3 percent increase from 2006. about 85 percent of our deposit balances are lower-cost core deposits. average core deposits increased 2 percent to $10.4 billion. City National’s remarkably strong deposit base goes a long way toward explaining why the company’s net interest margin is one of the strongest in the industry. While the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates by 100 basis points in 2007, our company’s net interest margin for the year narrowed only 13 basis points to 4.45 percent.
Noninterest income is an important and fast-growing component of City National’s revenue. in 2007, it rose 25 percent to $303.2 million.
Wealth management is still the primary driver of the company’s noninterest income growth– contributing about two-thirds of the total. asset management fee income increased 31 percent from the previous year, aided by the continuing success of City National asset Management,

a thorough strategic review confirmed City National’s value proposition.
During the last year, City National completed a thorough strategic review that confirmed its value proposition and its approach to full-service regional banking, while highlighting refinements that should enhance City National’s growth.
These adjustments include taking commercial banking and private banking to the next level as two distinct but interrelated businesses in California. Under the leadership of City National Bank’s president, Chris Warmuth, this has been implemented by adding Rod Banks, the new head of Commercial Banking Services, and Michael pagano, who now runs private Banking Services. Both men are proven performers who joined us in the past few months to improve both performance and growth through more focused expertise and energy in these two key areas.
in 2007, the company continued to invest in its future by adding to its banking and wealth management businesses with two important acquisitions – Business Bank of Nevada and Convergent Wealth advisors. Both are performing well and have great promise in 2008 and beyond.
in addition, City National expanded its opportunities for sensible growth by adding commercial banking teams in New york and Northern Nevada and a commercial real estate team in palo alto.
The company continued to expand its array of product and service offerings for its 62 branch offices and this year began to roll out its new City National preferred Banking program. There are about 800,000 “mass affluent” households in the markets that City National serves, and this

In Appreciation
The company’s past and future successes would not be possible without the dedication and effectiveness of so many people. in particular, we want to express our deep appreciation to City National’s outstanding Board of Directors. Their advice and counsel are invaluable.
We are also extremely grateful to City National’s very dedicated and talented team of colleagues, who exemplify this company’s long-standing commitment to excellence, service, diligence, teamwork and integrity. in challenging times, they have done an excellent job of executing our business model, serving our clients well and bettering the communities in which they work, live and do business.
Through various strategic community involvement partnerships and programs, such as the company’s Reading is The way up® literacy initiative, City National’s colleagues have a positive and measurable impact on the growth and prosperity of our communities.
in 2007, the company also made continuing progress in the “greening” of the bank. products and services like electronic loan applications, City National E-Deposit, new online Banking options and City National asset Management’s new “green” portfolio – to name a few – are helping clients and colleagues conserve and protect the environment, at the same time reducing costs and increasing choice and efficiency. Company programs to “reduce, reuse and recycle” also are achieving results.
We are very grateful to our remarkable clients and to you, the shareholders, for your confidence in City National and its management.
as always, City National remains committed to building long-term shareholder value, delivering consistent quality earnings growth and meeting the financial needs of each of its four key constituencies – clients, colleagues, shareholders and our communities – just as the company has done for over half a century and, we believe, will continue to do successfully for many more years to come.
