                 Letter to Shareholders
 ConocoPhillips is progressing through a three-year strategic plan to reposition the company. We are focused on optimizing our portfolio, enhancing returns, strengthening our financial flexibility and increasing shareholder distributions.
These actions began in 2010 and will extend through 2012. Consistent with this plan, we are implementing a spinoff of our downstream businesses into a new company, Phillips 66, with ConocoPhillips becoming an independent exploration and production company. Both will be leaders in their respective industries.
In 2011, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 20 percent, repurchased $11.1 billion of our shares, reduced debt by $1 billion and generated $4.8 billion from divestments that included the remainder of our LUKOIL holdings.
Our strategic initiatives were accompanied by financial and operational success during 2011. We operated well and captured market opportunities, resulting in a 38 percent increase in adjusted earnings to $12.2 billion. This improvement came despite the absence of $1.3 billion of equity earnings from LUKOIL, approximately $2 billion in higher taxes and 8 percent lower production volumes. Adjusted earnings per share of $8.76 benefited from our significant share repurchases and were 48 percent higher than in 2010.

E&P has replaced more than 130 percent of production over the past three years with organic proved reserve additions
at competitive finding and development costs. Combined with our share repurchase program and adjusting for Libya, we grew reserves per share by 12 percent in 2011 and increased production per share by 5 percent.
Following ConocoPhillips’ transition to an independent exploration and production company, we expect over the medium term to achieve 3 to 4 percent average annual organic production growth, as well as further growth in reserves, through development of legacy assets and approved projects. Such growth
will further enhance our production and reserves per share metrics.
In our Refining and Marketing (R&M) business, we have rationalized low-margin refining assets, reducing our processing capacity by more than 400,000 barrels per day since 2009, with further reductions planned to strengthen future returns.
In 2011, we met planned refinery utilization rates and improved clean product yields. The Wood River coker and refinery expansion project was completed, raising heavy crude oil processing capacity while increasing clean product yield by 5 percent at the refinery.
Our chemicals and midstream joint ventures delivered strong financial performance in 2011 in growing markets, with significant future investments planned.
These initiatives, along with market improvements, increased our return
on capital employed from 7 percent in 2009 to 14 percent during 2011. During the same period, cash returns on capital employed increased from 17 percent to 23 percent, while our greater focus on higher-margin production contributed to a 49 percent increase in income per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE) in 2011. We have targeted growing our average margin by approximately $5 per BOE over the next five years.

Repositioning
In July, consistent with our strategic plan, ConocoPhillips announced plans to separate into two leading energy companies. We have formed a new company, Phillips 66, which will comprise our downstream businesses and be distributed to shareholders as an independent, publicly traded company.
We expect to complete the repositioning in the second quarter of 2012. The new Phillips 66 will offer a unique approach
to downstream integration, comprising segment-leading refining and marketing, midstream and chemicals businesses. ConocoPhillips will continue as the industry’s largest and most diverse global pure-play exploration and production company.
The repositioning will help grow the value of both companies for our shareholders by unlocking the potential of their assets and employees. We believe this is the best way to succeed and ensure our competitiveness over the long term.
We deeply appreciate the ongoing commitment and support of our shareholders and employees as we embark on this new chapter in the long and successful history of our company.
