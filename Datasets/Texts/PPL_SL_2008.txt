Chairman's Letter
Dear Shareowners, As I write this letter to report on your company's performance in 2008, I'm struck by how much and how quickly our sector and the world's economy have changed. A year ago, wholesale electricity prices were rising, oil was headed to $150 a barrel and we were worrying about potential runaway inflation. Today, oil is priced at less than $50 a barrel, wholesale electricity prices have declined by 50 percent and our economy is mired in what looks like a lengthy recession. As you know, our 2008 reported earnings were $2.47 per share, compared with $3.35 per share in 2007. Earnings from ongoing operations, which exclude special items, were $2.02 per share, down from $2.60 per share in 2007, and well below the earnings forecast we made at the beginning of the year. The combination of the near collapse of the nation's banking system, unprecedented volatility and liquidity issues in wholesale energy markets, extended unplanned outages at two of our power plants and higher costs for everything from coal to financing made 2008 one of the most challenging years in the history of PPL. When faced with extraordinary challenges in our personal or our professional lives, there are a couple of options: We can lower our heads and simply wait for the pain to pass, or we can take action to actively manage the situation. While none of us at PPL is pleased with our results for 2008, I can tell you that we were not paralyzed by the events that came our way. Rather, we recalibrated our business plan based on a detailed analysis of our sector over the next couple of years. As a result, we took aggressive actions to reduce our risk in wholesale markets; we reduced our planned operations and maintenance spending; we suspended or canceled $200 million of capital projects for 2009; and we proactively

And, as the recession drags on, we have undertaken additional initiatives to reduce operating costs. Despite the near-term challenges, however, our fundamental approach and our excellent assets in key energy markets position us well to preserve existing value and to capture additional value as the economy recovers. We are forecasting 2010 earnings of $3.60 to $4.20 per share. This forecast is based on very visible earnings from our generation and marketing business and from our electricity delivery businesses in Pennsylvania and the U.K. We remain highly focused on delivering a total shareowner return that exceeds other investment options available to you.

grown, assuming reinvestment of dividends, to nearly $165 by the end of last year, outperforming both the S&P 500® Index and the Edison Electric Institute Index of Investor-owned Utilities. Understanding that a strong and growing dividend is an extremely important part of total shareowner return, we recently announced that we are increasing our dividend to an annualized level of $1.38, a 4-cent-pershare improvement. While this increase is more modest than recent years, we believe it is an important indicator ­ in very difficult times ­ of our financial strength and our focus on meeting your expectations. With this increase, our dividend is now 68 percent higher than it was five years ago. The board remains committed to reviewing the dividend on a regular basis and increasing it when the financial conditions of the company merit. PPL has now paid a dividend for 253 consecutive quarters. At PPL, we have such a strategy and we have the talented, dedicated people to capture value for shareowners. We thank you for your continued investment in PPL. You have our pledge to wisely manage the resources that you have entrusted to us and to continue to seek opportunities to grow value for you.

Sincerely,

James H. Miller Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer April 3, 2009
