TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS,
2016 WAS AN EXCELLENT YEAR FOR OUR COMPANY, AS WE SET RECORDS FOR BOTH SALES AND PROFITS.
Our net sales increased 8.9% over 2015, allowing us to reach the billion dollar milestone for the first time in our company’s history. This was helped by the mid-year acquisition of General Cable’s North American automotive ignition wire business. Excluding the acquisition, our net sales increased 3.5%, in line with our long-term forecasts.
Our net profits increased 31% over 2015. However, this is slightly misleading, as our 2015 results included roughly $10 million of one-time expenses, and thus 2015 was not a typical year. Excluding these historical one-time expenses, our net profits would have increased approximately 16%. As shown on the EPS graph on the opposite page, we can see a slow and steady upwards trend over a five year period. We anticipate that this trend will continue, for the following reasons.
First, industry demographics are favorable. Shown on the graphs below we see continuing positive trends both in vehicle population and average age of vehicles. A larger car parc with older vehicles tends to increase the demand for replacement parts.
Second, vehicles have become increasingly complex. Vehicle diagnostics have become more challenging and repairs more difficult to perform. This is leading both professional installers and do-it-yourselfers to look for higher quality parts and brand names they can trust. These are areas in
which we excel, and where our reputation is very strong.
Even more significant are the steps we are taking to build a better and stronger company for the future. Our strategic initiatives include the following.
First, we continue to make substantial investments in engineering resources and capital equipment to expand our in-house manufacturing. We produce today millions of dollars worth of product that we used to purchase. In addition to significant cost
savings, this enables us to have far better control over quality and delivery.
Second, we continue to rationalize our manufacturing operations, enabling us to achieve improvements in cost and efficiency.

We are currently in the process of closing two factories—one in Texas and one in Florida—and relocating their operations to existing SMP locations in the U.S. and Mexico. These are, of course, the most difficult decisions we ever have to make, as they affect our people, and as such we do not take them lightly. But we feel these moves are necessary for us to compete successfully in this challenging environment, where much of our competition is low-priced product from Asia. However, in every one of these cases, an important priority for us is to make sure that all affected employees are treated as fairly and generously as possible.
A third leg of our strategy is acquisitions. We have consummated nine in the last few years, and, as a group, they have been quite successful. One of the keys to our success is that we are disciplined in the type of acquisitions we seek. We pursue only two types of targets—“bolt-on”, where we look to acquire a competitor or a related line, and then merge it with our own operations; and “vertical integration”, where we acquire a major supplier of ours, and thus become a basic manufacturer of this product. By adhering to these guidelines, we believe we minimize the risk, achieve real and rapid synergies, and avoid the pitfalls often experienced in acquisitions.
Our most recent acquisition, General Cable’s North American automotive ignition wire business, fits this profile exactly. They were a highly regarded competitor with many prestigious customers. We are pleased to have retained all of these accounts, and have begun integrating the two businesses with positive results. We expect the integration to be complete by the end of the first quarter of 2018, and look forward to additional savings once completed.
Turning to more recent news, we previously announced a dividend increase, from 17 cents per quarter to 19 cents per quarter. This marks the eighth consecutive year of a dividend increase, as we continue with our goal of returning cash to our shareholders.
Finally, we are pleased to announce that Patrick McClymont has agreed to join our Board of Directors. Patrick comes to us with a wealth of experience. He has been a Partner and Managing Director at Goldman Sachs, an Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Sotheby’s, and is currently an Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at IMAX. We are excited to have him join us.
To summarize, we are very pleased with our 2016 results. We thank our group of over 4,000 employees who are the main reason for our success, and look forward to continued success in the future.
