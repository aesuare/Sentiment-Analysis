Business conditions remained very favorable for containerboard and corrugated products in 2007. PCA was able to benefit from these conditions and
generated records for sales, earnings, and containerboard production and shipments. During the year, container- board prices, on an inflation adjusted basis, reached their highest level since 2000. Industry containerboard production was up 0.3% over last year, driven in part by a very strong export market, while industry corrugated products shipments were down about 1.4%. Container- board inventories remained at historically low levels the entire year and ended the year at their lowest level since 1994. Operating rates for the industry remained very high, averaging 97.4% of capacity for the year.
The increase in net income of $45 million, or $0.41
per share, was driven primarily by higher pricing and improved sales volume and product mix which together improved earnings by $76 million, or $0.72 per share. These earnings improvements were partially offset by higher labor and benefit costs ($15 million, or $0.14 per share), recycled and wood fiber costs ($13 million, or $0.12 per share), and transportation costs ($3 million, or $0.03 per share).
Cash generated from operations totaled $300 million in 2007. Capital expenditures for the year were
$113 million which equals about 75% of depreciation. PCA returned $136 million to shareholders including $105 million in common stock dividends and $31 million in share repurchases. PCA ended the year with $228 million cash-on-hand compared to $162 million at year- end 2006, a $66 million increase. Total outstanding debt at December 31, 2007 was $677 million, with an average cash interest rate of 5.4%, which equates to an annual cash interest expense of $37 million, or 1.6% of sales.
Free cash flow (3) from operations was $187 million driven by strong financial results including low interest expense and moderate capital expenditures. Since 2000, PCA’s cash generated from operations has averaged $268 million per year, and after deducting average capital expenditures of $114 million, free cash flow(3) has averaged $154 million.

PCA reported record earnings of $170 million, or $1.61 per share, compared to $125 million, or $1.20 per share, in 2006, a 36% improvement in net income. Full year sales were $2.32 billion compared to $2.19 billion in 2006, also a new record.

 Operationally, PCA had another outstanding year. operations, and 27 lower-volume sheet plants with
Containerboard production was up 1.8% over 2006, a new record. Cash manufacturing costs were up 4.7% driven by higher fiber costs, the largest single cost element to produce containerboard. The price
of recycled fiber (OCC) was up $40 per ton, or 56% compared to 2006. With PCA’s fiber flexibility, OCC represents only about 16% of total purchased fiber which is among the lowest use in the industry, but higher OCC costs still lowered 2007 earnings by
$0.10 per share.
Virgin fiber costs were also higher in 2007, particularly in the fourth quarter. These higher costs were driven,
in part, by the downturn in housing, resulting in lower availability of residual wood chips from wood products plants. Fiber flexibility enabled Counce, our largest containerboard mill, to substitute lower-cost pulpwood in place of purchased chips, reducing purchased chip use by about 20% compared to 2006 and 30% compared
to 2005. This was possible because after building a new woodyard at Counce, the old woodyard was mothballed and maintained in the event that more pulpwood capacity was needed for emergency situations. This proved to be the case in 2007, and as a result, higher wood fiber costs reduced earnings by only $2 million, or $0.02 per share.
PCA’s containerboard volume was very strong in 2007 with domestic containerboard shipments up 5% and export containerboard shipments up 25%. Total corru- gated products shipments were down 0.3% compared to 2006 while industry shipments were down 1.4%. Since 1997, PCA’s total shipments have increased 31% compared to industry shipments that were flat over this time period.
converting operations only. In many cases, these sheet plants are located in close proximity to full-line plants, enabling us to better serve customer needs for special products, shorter runs and stringent service requirements. We believe this operating flexibility between plants gives us a competitive strength, which we will continue to build upon, both through internal growth and box plant acquisitions.
Creating and returning value to shareholders remained a priority in 2007. During the year, PCA paid a quarterly dividend at an annual rate of $1.00 per share and also repurchased $31 million of the company’s common stock. In October 2007, PCA announced a
20% increase in its quarterly common stock dividend, starting in January 2008, to an annual rate of $1.20
per share, and also announced plans to repurchase up
to $150 million of its common stock. Based upon the year-end closing stock price, the dividend yield on
PCA’s common stock was the highest in the industry.
We enter 2008 with strong pricing for both container- board and corrugated products. Industry containerboard inventories were also at their lowest year-ending level since 1994. While there is concern and uncertainty about the strength of the U.S. economy, PCA should continue to benefit from a weak U.S. dollar that has served to support the strong export market for linerboard. Also, if the weak dollar can help stimulate the export
of more finished goods from the U.S., this, in turn, could help improve the demand for corrugated containers.
On a negative note, cost pressures in such areas as fiber, energy, transportation and labor and benefits remain a concern that impacts profitability.
Our strategy will continue to revolve around the strong operational and financial flexibility we possess to create and return value to our shareholders. Our low use of OCC, natural gas and fuel oil helps limit the impact of cost increases in containerboard manufac- turing, and our growth in corrugated products over the past ten years supports our premise that we provide the best value to our customers and are easy to do business with. Finally, our financial position is strong with low debt levels and interest expense and strong cash flow. All of this, we think, demonstrates that we are well positioned to continue to deliver industry leading financial results in 2008.
