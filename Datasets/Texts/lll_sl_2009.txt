Dear Fellow Shareholders:
 In the areas of greatest concern and relevance to our national security, L-3 is there—whenever and wherever our customers need us. Our people proved it again during 2009, moving with remark- able speed and agility to support our customers’ need to respond to reality, all over the world.
This is why we were able to deliver strong results in a challenging economic and industry environment. I want to begin this letter with my thanks to L-3’s management and workforce— your skill, commitment and teamwork enabled every one of our accomplishments.

PERFORMANCE
We achieved or exceeded our financial goals in 2009 despite an environment of slow growth in the defense sector and continued weakness in the overall economy. Our company-wide sales for the year were $15.6 billion, up 5 percent over 2008’s $14.9 billion, with diluted earnings per share of $7.61.
We continued our track record of strong cash flow generation in 2009, achieving net cash from operating activities of $1.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.2 billion. We focused, as always, on deploying our excess cash to increase shareholder value. We grew our dividend for the fifth consecutive year and repurchased $505 million of L-3 stock. In all, we returned $670 million in cash to L-3 shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the year. In 2009, we also made an acquisition that strengthened our position in the undersea warfare market, and in the first quarter of 2010, we announced our agreement to acquire Insight Technology, significantly augmenting our capabilities in mission-critical night vision and electro-optical equipment for the warfighter.
In the fourth quarter of 2009, we refinanced a substantial portion of our debt. We completed a $1 billion offering of senior notes, L-3’s first investment-grade bond issue, a significant milestone for the company. We used the proceeds together with cash on hand to redeem $750 million of our senior subordinated notes and to repay our $650 million term loan. In addition, we replaced our expiring revolving credit facility with a new three-year $1 billion facility. As a result, we reduced our debt by about $400 million and entered the new year with significantly improved liquidity, a more favorable debt maturity profile and a greater ability to take advantage of future growth opportunities.
L-3’s already strong Board of Directors became decidedly stronger with the addition of Lewis Kramer in July. He joined our Board shortly after retiring from Ernst & Young, where he enjoyed a distinguished 40-year career, most recently as a member of the firm’s U.S. Executive Board. Lew brings a wealth of practical business knowledge and experience to the L-3 boardroom—we are very pleased to have him on the team. We would also like to thank Peter A. Cohen for his insight and guidance to L-3’s Board over the past five years.
We posted a number of major wins across our business throughout the year, many of which illustrated our strategy of improving our competitiveness and delivering value through increased teamwork across the company. Through collaboration between divisions, we integrated our unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) capabilities and won a major program as a prime contractor. The U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) selected L-3 for the Expeditionary UAS program to provide fully integrated unmanned aircraft systems and support.
In addition to this important win, we expanded our UAS offerings with the introduction of two new L-3 products currently being developed—MobiusTM, the medium-altitude, long-endurance manned or unmanned aircraft system, and the Cutlass, an expendable, air- or tube-launched, small UAS. Each will bring disruptive performance in the form of increased value and capability to this growing marketplace.
L-3 is well known for its agility and speed of response to customer requirements. Among the best examples of this is our performance on Project Liberty, a U.S. Air Force program to equip, integrate, deploy and support King Air 350 aircraft for ISR missions within an accelerated time frame. We successfully delivered the first aircraft eight months after receiving the contract. The first aircraft was deployed initially in Iraq in June and began missions in Afghanistan in December. Our people worked around the clock, seven days a week to deliver the aircraft on schedule and within budget—a commitment that has been attributed to saving lives on the battlefield.
There were many more accomplishments of note across our business in 2009, too many to acknowledge in this letter. We provide an overview of the year’s highlights in this report, including intelligence analysis work for military and joint coalition forces, L-3’s involvement with the USS New York, the Navy’s newest amphibious transport dock ship, SATCOM On-The-Move, and other capability-enhancing communications.
OPPORTUNITY
We continue to pursue growth opportunities by building on our position and performance as a prime contractor, and by integrating our capabilities and technologies to improve our win rate and deliver higher levels of customer value. We are maintaining our strong investment in R&D to develop next-generation technologies in areas including ISR, training and simulation, precision munitions and mobile electric power. At the same time, we are continuing our focus on increasing operational efficiency across the company to further improve margins and speed products to market.
For our C3ISR business, we see continued robust demand for real-time, networked commu- nications delivered by manned and unmanned surveillance technology. The Iraq drawdown and Afghanistan surge also represent just two growth opportunities for our Government Services segment over the next few years. An op-tempo environment and an aging fleet in need of upgrades are major long-term potential growth drivers for our AM&M business.
The breadth of L-3’s products, subsystems and systems portfolio within our Electronic Systems segment keeps us relevant across our diverse customer base, providing a stable, balanced growth platform, even in volatile market conditions. Outside the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the need for our products and services is widespread and global in nature. We continue to pursue international growth by expanding our footprint in key regions, such as Australia, Asia and the Middle East, and increasing foreign military sales. In addition, we are developing growth opportunities in cyber security, sustainable and alternative energy, electromagnetic pulse technol- ogy and select commercial markets.
L-3 has a long history of successfully growing through acquisition, and we see an improving mergers and acquisitions environment in 2010. We will continue to apply our disciplined approach, evaluating companies that bring new capabilities, products or technologies to enhance L-3’s existing business areas or provide access to important programs and new customers.
The world continues to address threats to global security and stability. In 2009, we were reminded of this reality with the Christmas day terrorist attempt on a U.S. bound aircraft. This has led to increased interest in our ProVisionTM millimeter wave checkpoint screening technology, and we are working with the TSA and foreign transportation authorities to meet their demands for this system.
With an asymmetrical threat environment and emerging regions of concern, defense priori- ties continue to change and evolve. There has been a fundamental shift in focus from a threat- based model to a capabilities-based one that can be structured to meet today’s national and homeland security requirements. We do not see a sudden drop in DoD funding in the foreseeable future. There are many pressing demands—for streaming video and secure communications to support the warfighter; for maintenance, sustainment and resetting of current assets; for training and simulation systems and enhanced airport security. These and other current needs align very well with L-3’s expertise and portfolio of capabilities.
L-3 is unique among large defense companies. We are a prime contractor and also a formi- dable supplier. We have less exposure to large, new start platforms that are likely to be curtailed or delayed. We are a lean, fast-moving organization that remains competitive in a transforming industry. Our structure and culture are unique—with business units that maintain a high degree of autonomy, while increasingly working in cohesive, collaborative teams to deliver results.
Our strengths are a major advantage in today’s dynamic industry, economic and geopolitical landscape—qualities that we will continue to leverage aggressively to respond to reality, benefitting our customers, our company and our investors in 2010 and beyond.
Sincerely,
Michael T. Strianese
chairman, president and chief executive officer
