DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
Hormel Foods continues to grow, achieving sales growth of 6%, and increasing earnings per share by 5% in 2013 to a record $1.95 per share.
Grocery Products provided significant revenue and earnings growth this year, buoyed by the acquisition of the SKIPPY® line of products early in the year. The SKIPPY® purchase was the largest transaction in our history, offering us an opportunity to create value for our shareholders by employing our strong balance sheet. The acquisition of the SKIPPY® line added another iconic protein brand to our portfolio, providing an excellent platform for innovation in new categories. This acquisition also brought additional diversification to our input mix, and with sales in over 30 countries on 5 continents, allowed us to more quickly expand our footprint in markets outside of the United States. Our team has done an excellent job fully integrating the SKIPPY® business in all areas with the exception of the China business, which closed subsequent to the end of the fiscal year with integration to follow shortly thereafter. Our Refrigerated Foods segment faced volatile input costs throughout the year along with retail softness in some areas of their business. By continuing to expand the value-added portfolio through innovation, along with improving the product mix, the segment was able to deliver a modest increase in both revenue and earnings over last year. Our Jennie-O Turkey Store segment faced several challenges during the year, including high grain costs and weaker commodity meat markets. While full year earnings declined, our team was able to increase revenue by continuing to grow its sales of value-added items. While the Specialty Foods segment grew sales and earnings for the year, this segment was negatively affected late in 2013 due to the expiration of the agreement allowing it to sell certain sugar substitutes, which will continue as a headwind into 2014. The Specialty Foods team is focused on developing branded product innovations to contribute to revenue and earnings growth in the future. The International & Other segment continued to drive double-digit growth in sales and earnings in 2013. With a focus on further developing markets for the SPAM® family of products and exports of niche fresh pork items, expansion of business in China, and now the SKIPPY® line of products, we anticipate similar growth by this segment in 2014 and beyond. Innovation is the key to staying relevant with consumers, allowing us to deliver sustainable growth and value to our shareholders over the long-term. Innovation efforts across all segments focus on answering the unmet needs of consumers and customers. An excellent example of our

innovation efforts is the Hormel® REV® wraps line of products launched earlier this year. REV® wraps were developed to provide teenagers with a high-protein, satiating on-the-go snack, and are proving popular with consumers of all ages. We vigilantly monitor use of capital throughout our organization to ensure a high rate of return for our investors. We will continue to allocate our resources to investments that offer the highest returns over the long-term, including investing in product innovation, employee and food safety, improvements to existing manufacturing facilities, and acquisitions that complement our strategic initiatives. Dividends 2014 will mark the 48 th consecutive year we have increased our dividend, an achievement matched by few other companies. Effective in the new fiscal year, the dividend will be 80 cents per share, a substantial 18 percent (or 12 cents per share) increase to the annual dividend. Corporate responsibility We strive to cultivate an environment where integrity is absolute, people aspire to build long-term careers, and we positively impact the communities in which we do business. We are always honored when those efforts are recognized externally. In 2013 we were acknowledged for our unwavering dedication to conducting business responsibly with a 100 Best Corporate Citizens award by CR Magazine for the fifth consecutive year. We were also included on G.I. Jobs magazine's 2013 Top Military Friendly Employers list and named on Selling Power magazine's 50 Best Companies to Sell For list for the sixth consecutive year. Our employees are involved in their communities and are committed to making a difference in the places where they live and work. As a company we support their efforts through programs such as On Our Way to Ending Hunger, now in its third year. Through this program we made cash and product donations this year in more than 20 communities where we have manufacturing locations. We continued our effort to improve lives internationally through nutrition, educational programming, and leadership development for children and families in Guatemala. Since the inception of Project SpammyTM in 2010, we have contributed over 6 million cans of SpammyTM , a shelf-stable

poultry-based fortified spread developed to blend into and supplement the traditional diet of any culture. Through our collaboration with Caritas-Guatemala and Food For the Poor, Project SpammyTM is helping us succeed in our mission to make real, sustainable differences in children's lives. Senior management changes In July, the company announced the advancement of several senior leaders in the Refrigerated Foods management team. Thomas R. Day advanced to Group Vice President, Refrigerated Foods, Deanna T. Brady progressed to Group Vice President, Foodservice, and Mark J. Ourada was promoted to Vice President of Sales, Foodservice. In September, Dr. Phillip L. Minerich, Vice President of Research and Development, announced his retirement effective December 31, 2013. During his career at Hormel Foods, Minerich significantly advanced the Company's food science capabilities and drove many new product innovations. Dr. Kevin L. Myers replaced Minerich and was advanced to Vice President of Research and Development. Outlook Moving into 2014, we expect continued sales and earnings growth in four of our five segments, with Specialty Foods in a rebuilding year after the expiration of a sugar substitute sales agreement during 2013. Grain and turkey commodity markets heading into 2014 appear favorable, which will benefit our turkey and hog operations. Beef input costs and potential volatility in hog markets may offset some of the commodity market gains. By providing consumers with valued, innovative products with trusted brands we will continue to deliver growth. Much gratitude is owed to our 19,800 employees. The knowledge, depth, and tenure of our team allow us to deliver consistent, wholesome products trusted by consumers throughout the world which, in turn, drives growth to you, our shareholders.
