Dear Fellow Shareholders,
This is a milestone year for Lockheed Martin: our 100th anniversary. Our company’s success over the past century is due to the exceptional character and ingenuity of the hundreds of thousands of people who have walked through the doors of our heritage companies. As this remarkable enterprise begins its second century, we and our customers face unprecedented global security challenges and an uncertain economic environment.
Despite the unsettling business climate, Lockheed Martin reaffirmed its reputation as an industry leader by recording another year of excellent financial and operational results. We were well served in 2011 by a durable, well-balanced portfolio, and a strategy that focuses on execution, affordability, and the agility to respond effectively to change.

Cyber security is a critical component of everything we do, and every solution we develop.
I 2011 Annual Report
 
As reflected in this report, financial results were consistently strong in 2011 with sales of $46.5 billion, representing a two percent increase over 2010. We grew our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to $7.85, and we grew our backlog to a record $80.7 billion at the end of 2011.
Balanced cash deployment is a key element of our strategy. In 2011, we generated $4.3 billion in cash from operations after making $2.3 billion in contributions to our pension plans. We deployed cash to generate shareholder value through cash dividends of $1.1 billion and share repurchases of $2.4 billion. Our total shareholder return for the year was 21 percent, outperforming all major indices.
Our record of strong cash generation has
allowed us to pursue selected acquisitions that add greater depth to our portfolio. In 2011, we completed our acquisition of QTC Holdings, Inc., the largest provider of outsourced medical evaluation services to the U.S. Government and Department of Veterans Affairs. Our distinction as the number one supplier of IT services to the federal government, coupled with QTC’s case management services and health care expertise, now position us to help improve health care for veterans, reservists, active duty, and civilian government personnel. We also acquired Netherlands-based Sim-Industries, B.V., which develops and manufactures flight simulators
for a wide range of airline customers. These acquisitions demonstrate our commitment to expand into closely related markets that build on our core capabilities and grow our customer base.
Structuring and Managing the Enterprise for Efficiency
Because we operate in a dynamic environment, we continuously evolve our organizational structure to respond with even greater agility and precision to changing business conditions and customer priorities. To that end, in
September 2011 we created the Executive Office of the Chairman to include the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer.
Through this structure, we stay closely aligned on all operational and functional matters as they arise, and we act interchangeably and decisively to ensure we meet our customers’ expectations, and that we focus on excellent performance and profitable growth. We are confident this new structure better aligns business strategy with program execution and affordability.
Additionally, we announced this year the appointment of Larry A. Lawson as executive vice president for Aeronautics, effective
April 1. Larry, who currently serves as vice president and general manager of the F-35 program, brings a keen understanding of the entire Aeronautics portfolio. He succeeds Ralph D. Heath, whose leadership of our Aeronautics business has been defined by innovation, attention to performance, and a dedication to the highest standards of ethics and accountability.
Operational Excellence Drives Financial Results
We realize that affordability – creating greater efficiencies and lowering costs in everything we do – is a permanent feature of our corporate culture. We monitor all aspects of our operations to ensure we are always aligned with business needs and positioned to offer value to our customers. We also work closely with our 29,000 active suppliers to drive affordability into every program.
We also recognize that the greatest contributor
to the vitality of this company is solid execution on our customers’ programs. We have made considerable progress on the development and production phases of the F-35 as evidenced by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta’s lifting of the probation on the F-35B Short-Takeoff/Vertical

Landing (STOVL) variant on January 20, 2012. Saying the F-35 “remains essential’’ for future air superiority, the Secretary’s action reflects the talent and tenacity of the men and women working to make this program a success.
We exceeded F-35 flight test and test point goals in 2011 with 972 test flights against a plan of 872, and we tallied 7,823 test points against a plan of 6,622. We also completed the Static Structural Testing, which verified the structural integrity of the airframe, ahead of schedule. On October 3, we saw the picture-perfect vertical landing of the STOVL variant on the deck of the USS WASP, a significant milestone for
the F-35 program. A second test jet landed on deck a few days later, and over 18 days the two aircraft completed 72 short takeoffs and vertical landings. We invite you to view the video of these historic flights and other F-35 milestones at our website, www.F35.com.
In December, Japan’s Ministry of Defense chose the F-35 as that nation’s next generation fighter aircraft. Japan joins Israel as a Foreign Military Salescustomer,and theUnitedStatesandeight partner countries on this 11-nation program.
Overall, we continued to grow our international sales in 2011 with orders to upgrade armored fighting vehicles for the United Kingdom, contracts for a combined 30 F-16 aircraft to Iraq and Oman, and the first international order to produce the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system for export to the United Arab Emirates.
In 2011, we also witnessed the last Space Shuttle mission. For 30 years – in partnership with NASA – Lockheed Martin demonstrated
a dedication to excellence on the Shuttle program, supplying components, payloads, and every one of the external fuel tanks that boosted the spacecraft into orbit. The next adventure in space exploration has already begun, and we are once again at the forefront with our Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.
Some of our other notable achievements in 2011 on behalf of our customers in defense and civil government agencies in the United States and worldwide include:

The Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Army achieved the first-ever simultaneous intercept of two targets using two THAAD interceptors in an operational test. Since 2005, the program has completed 12 flight tests with nine-for-nine intercepts. This capability
is critical to a robust missile deterrent and defense.
We began construction on our third Littoral Combat Ship (LCS). With each ship, the
team continues to drive costs down through efficiencies, design stability, and supplier partnerships. In addition, our second LCS, the Fort Worth, is on-cost and on-schedule for delivery to the U.S. Navy in 2012. Aside from its success in drug smuggling interdiction,
the LCS will play an important role in the Asia-Pacific region as part of the Defense Department’s new Strategic Guidance.
We achieved Initial Operating Capability for the FBI’s Next Generation Identification System, which will help law enforcement take more criminals off the streets.
K-MAX, our rugged and versatile unmanned cargo aircraft system, was deployed to Afghanistan. During the first six weeks of operation, the two aircraft delivered more than 100,000 pounds of cargo to forward operating bases. Lockheed Martin and partner Kaman Aerospace transformed this helicopter into an unmanned system that can fly through hostile territory for the battlefield resupply mission.
We are in production on 29 additional Persistent Threat Detection Systems (PTDS) for the U.S. Army to support and protect coalition forces in Afghanistan.

• The Space Based Infrared System (SBIRS) spacecraft, launched in May, will protect our nation and allies from missile attack with vastly improved warning capabilities.
• We delivered software to the Federal Aviation Administration to enable GPS technology
in the New York area airspace, the nation’s second busiest.
• Our Juno spacecraft was launched to Jupiter in August on a mission that will expand
our knowledge of the solar system’s largest planet. A month later, our two GRAIL spacecraft were launched to the Moon in
an effort to study the gravitational field of Earth’s closest neighbor.
These and other accomplishments are why Lockheed Martin has been acknowledged as an industry leader. In 2011, Aviation Week & Space Technology named us the industry’s Top Performing Company for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, saying that as far as program performance and cost are concerned, “Lockheed Martin is the one to beat.’’
Aviation Week’s recognition speaks volumes about the 123,000 people of this company who support our customers, and also give so much to our communities. For the seventh consecutive year, in 2011, our employees volunteered more than one million hours of service to a wide variety of worthwhile causes.
Additionally, we are dedicated to good stewardship of the environment. For example, the Carbon Disclosure Project, in its 2011 Global 500 Report, noted Lockheed Martin as leading the Aerospace and Defense industry in carbon footprint reduction. With our heightened awareness of cost and affordability, we’re working hard to limit waste and conserve energy because it’s smart business and it’s the right thing to do for the environment.
The work many of our employees engage in
to support our customers at times comes with great risk. In a tragic reminder of those risks, two of our colleagues were killed and two others injured during an April 2011 attack on
a forward operating base in Afghanistan. They were on a team providing vitally important surveillance information to U.S. military and coalition forces, and they were dedicated to the program, the mission, and the fight for freedom. Their sacrifice reminds us of the important work we do every day supporting deployed forces in the defense of liberty.
Looking to the Future: Staying Aligned With Our Customers
As a leading global security and aerospace company, we must maintain a consistent tempo of performance to sustain our momentum into 2012 and beyond. This is especially critical given the developments we see on the horizon. We continue to operate in a tough economy, which includes a reduction in the Department of Defense budget by at least $487 billion over the next decade. We also see shifting priorities under Secretary Panetta’s new Strategic Guidance that put greater attention on the Asia-Pacific region and continued focus on the Middle East.
Our broad portfolio of strong programs gives us the resilience to weather this budget volatility and it matches extremely well with the strategic priorities of our customers under the new Defense Department Guidance. Increasingly, our customers will require the capabilities we’re best equipped to deliver, such as air and naval power, missile defense, 5th Generation tactical aircraft, space systems, cyber security, and support for Special Operations Forces.
We are concerned, however, that we still face the possibility of U.S. budget sequestration in January 2013. Sequestration would result in an additional $1.2 trillion in automatic across-the- board cuts evenly divided between defense and non-defense spending over 10 years. Coupled

with the $487 billion already cut from the budget, sequestration would result in almost
a trillion-dollar reduction in defense spending over the next decade. Secretary Panetta has said that cuts of that magnitude would have catastrophic consequences to U.S. defense and would severely erode America’s industrial base. We agree. We must not let an automatic budget trigger become the dominant force for allocating resources and shaping the nation’s security posture.
We are strengthening the enterprise by adhering to a strategy that puts a premium on execution. Our relentless focus on execution is a significant factor in reducing the cost of doing business, and our remarkable record
of innovation continues to play a pivotal role in keeping our portfolio relevant. Innovation allows us to build on our core, move quickly and smartly as new opportunities arise, and meet affordability goals.
As we look ahead, we recognize that we
are operating at a critical inflection point as America and her allies confront an emerging national and global security landscape. We have devised a strategic blueprint based on four imperatives: Secure, Extend, Expand, and Enable. This strategy, which leverages the strength of our portfolio, will pave the way through what will be, at times, an uncertain voyage. It will:
• Secure our existing programs by performing with excellence. Additionally, we must continue to have candid dialogues with
February 23, 2012
our customers and the highest degree of transparency on all our programs.
• Extend the value of our platforms by shaping follow-on business and tailoring our existing capabilities for new applications. We should also continue to seek and implement innovative business models.
• Expand our position within targeted segments with market-based strategies. This also means more pursuits internationally, and greater synergies between Lockheed Martin products.
• Enable meaningful growth through adjacent market opportunities. We want to focus on markets that will move the needle for us.
Over the course of a century, we have made extraordinary contributions, working with
our customers, to meet our nation’s greatest challenges: victory in war, prosperity in peace, exploration of the universe, and effective government services for our citizens. From building some of the very first aircraft for the U.S. military ... to sending spacecraft across the solar system ... to meeting the diverse needs of the U.S. Government and its allies today, the men and women of Lockheed Martin have always risen to the occasion with iconic technical achievements.
We have no doubt we will continue to build on that record, serving with distinction, remaining true to our values, and helping to make the world a safer, better place for the next 100 years.
