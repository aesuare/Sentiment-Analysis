Dear Fellow Shareholders:
2006 was a very successful year for Goodrich. We continued to build on our market leadership positions with strategic new business wins in both the commercial aerospace and defense market sectors. Our strategy to achieve top quartile aerospace results through balanced growth, leveraging the enterprise and operational excellence is working.
We expect that the robust market for commercial aerospace and
defense products will continue for several years. The strength in our
commercial aerospace markets and our relentless focus on operational excellence led to higher sales and significantly improved earnings in 2006. This is the third consecutive year that we have achieved both sales and earnings growth. Our margins are increasing steadily – segment operating income margins improved from 11.5% of sales in 2005 to 13.0% in 2006, and we are on track to achieve margins of at least 15% by 2009. We continue to invest in our businesses and expect these investments to deliver sustainable long-term growth.
Operational excellence continued to be a key strategic focus for us in 2006. Our entire enterprise
is focused on achieving world-class levels of delivery and quality performance by 2009. Our global supply chain management effort is gaining traction, and we are increasing our own engineering and manufacturing

         capabilities in low-cost countries. The organizational realignment that we announced in December 2006 is expected to enable us to accelerate our progress in this important area.
in 2006, we welcomed a new member to the Goodrich Board of Directors. Lloyd W. Newton, retired General, U.S. air Force, brings to Goodrich’s Board extensive experience in high-level leadership roles gained during a distinguished 34-year military career. James R. Wilson, a Director since December 1997, will retire at the 2007 annual Meeting of Shareholders. his wise counsel and able assistance will be missed.
During the year we placed additional emphasis on the four characteristics that form the basis of our enterprise culture: ethical behavior, customer-focused improvement, accountability and teamwork, and openness and trust. One of the cornerstones of our culture is the development of talent – having the right people in the right place at the right time. Going forward, the combination of strategic investments and operational excellence, along with developing our talent and a strong enterprise culture, will perpetuate our business.
as we look ahead, our new program wins will require alignment of all of our businesses and a strong focus on execution. We expect to use our solid market positions to deliver balanced top-line growth. Our entire organization is concentrating on expanding our margins and accelerating cash flow through leveraging the enterprise and operational excellence. With our key strategies firmly in place, Goodrich is well-positioned to deliver sustained growth over the next several years and beyond the eventual peak of new commercial aircraft deliveries.
in closing, i would like to thank our 23,000 employees around the world for working so hard to enhance customer and shareholder value in 2006.
