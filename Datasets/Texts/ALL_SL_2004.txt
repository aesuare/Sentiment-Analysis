Dear Fellow Shareholders:Last fall I visited Florida with Tom Wilson, presidentof our Allstate Protection business. Four hurricanes hadjust ravaged the state over six devastating weeks. As weviewed the overwhelming damage, we knew that 2,300claim adjusters were reaching out to customers. At thatmoment, three thoughts came to mind. Insurance playsa critical role in our lives. Scale and financial strengthreally count in this business. And we know how torespond when customers and communities need us most.People come first. That’s Allstate’s stand.2For Allstate, transparency means giving investors clear and easyaccess to all the information they need to assess our performance. Thisfinancial scorecard demonstrates our progress in executing our “better,bigger, broader” strategy.3,0006,0009,00012,00015,0008001,6002,4003,2004,0007,00014,00021,00028,00035,0003.06.09.012.015.0.801.602.403.204.00.801.602.403.204.002000 2001 2002 2003 20042000 2001 2002 2003 20041.602.954.543.831.604.413.772.922.682.0613.06.7 6.514.215.029,134 28,86533,93629,57932,1492,0041,4923,0912,0752,662Non-proprietary channels Proprietary channel11,21713,07210,7899,7709,33512,24515,91913,09510,605 11,8341,0282,064 2,306 2,847 1,270Net Income Per Diluted Share(in dollars)Net income per diluted share dividesnet income by the number of weightedaverage diluted shares outstanding.

In 2004 we setmany performance records. And over time, we’vedemonstrated that Allstate is an exceptionalinvestment because of the market we serve, thestrategy we’re successfully executing and thelong-term value our efforts create. Importantly,we understand the critical role that carefulcapital management, responsible governanceand doing the right thing in our communitiesplay in our ongoing success.2004 brought out the best in Allstate. Bymeeting the challenges from nature and themarketplace, we confirmed the value of ourpromise, our products and our expertise. Wealso gave you a yardstick for measuring yourcompany’s capacity for profitable growth –even in the wake of unusually severe catastrophes.Last year we incurred $17.8 billion intotal Property-Liability insurance claims andclaims expense. We generated $33.9 billion intotal revenues – an all-time high.Net income per diluted share rose 18.5 percentto $4.54. Operating income rose 16.1 percent to$3.1 billion and operating income return on equity*was 17.0 percent. We raised the dividend paidon our common stock by 22 percent, completedour repurchase of $1.5 billion in stock a yearahead of schedule and announced a new, twoyear$4.0 billion share repurchase program.These results and actions clearly demonstrateour determination to use your capital effectively.The market responded favorably as our stockprice reached a then all-time high closing priceof $51.76 on December 30, 2004.A Profitable MarketI’m often asked how Allstate can deliver suchstrong performance in mature industries likeinsurance and financial services. Part of theanswer is knowing where the best opportunitiesexist – and what it takes to win customers. TheU.S. personal auto and homeowners market comprisesapproximately 111 million households, morethan 169 million insured vehicles and approximately$205 billion in annual premiums. Moststates and banks require consumers to haveinsurance in order to operate a car or buy ahome. So each year gives us fresh opportunitiesto expand the more than 16 million householdsthat are part of the Allstate family. We also servean increasing share of our customers’ personalfinancial services needs through our life insurance,retirement and investment products.Within a few years, millions of Baby Boomerswill start to reach retirement age. That meansthere’s a solid opportunity to grow revenuesand earnings, especially as economic conditionsimprove.Within the insurance market, several demographicsegments offer especially high growth potential.The personal lines insurance market mirrorsthis country’s changing ethnic mix and shiftingpopulation patterns, and we’re seizing theseopportunities in a variety of ways. There’s alsocontinuing growth in single-person householdsand increasing sophistication among consumersaged 25-34. In addition, many consumers takeAllstate knows where the best market opportunitiesexist. We’re executing a consistent strategy to driveprofitable growth. We’re acting with integrity andinvesting our capital wisely. As a result, we’recreating long-term value for shareholders.3Making an informed investmentdecision is clear whenyou understand how marketfocus and disciplined strategycreate value.* See page 134Moving faster than the market.That’s our stand.fewer risks and have fewer, less severe claims.For these high lifetime value customers, theinsurable assets we help protect – and the valueof these relationships – increase over time.We’re well-positioned to find and serve thesesegments of the market. Each year, more consumerswant our financial strength behindthem. They’re drawn to our diverse line of competitivelypriced insurance products. And theyvalue their relationships with agents and thework we do to support their communities.As the Baby Boom population ages, middleincomecustomers will require not just protectionfor today, but preparation for tomorrow. Thesecustomers see the value of diversified investmentportfolios that include retirement-oriented financialproducts in addition to life and long-termcare insurance. And they’re looking to consolidatetheir relationships with experienced professionals.Through our agent and non-proprietary salesnetworks, we’re targeting those who are activelysaving, in an effort to increase our share of theirlife, savings and retirement business. Total premiumsand deposits for Allstate Financial in 2004rose to a record $15.9 billion, a 13.4 percentcompound annual growth rate from 1999 to2004, a clear sign the market is responding toour life insurance, retirement and investmentproducts.To protect our financial strength and yours, wemust also manage several variables that canaffect our market – and our performance. Naturalcatastrophes are part of our business, and weconstantly refine our business to help protect ourcustomers and manage our financial exposure. InFlorida, for example, we’re working closely withstate officials to provide better insurance protectionagainst hurricanes. We hope to have in placebefore the next hurricane season an improvedpublic/private partnership that more effectivelyprotects consumers and investors. We also monitorregulation, competition and claim trendsstate-by-state. This analysis helps us win profitablemarket share by delivering highly competitivepricing, especially to our target customers.With this disciplined approach, policies in forcefor our Allstate brand auto insurance and homeownerspolicies sustained a path of growth,demonstrating steady increases over the pastyear. Our aggressive, focused marketing effortshave helped convince one million auto customersto switch to Allstate. And Allstate brand customerretention closed 2004 at near record levels.All these trends indicate that we’re turningmarket knowledge into competitive advantage.A Consistent StrategyIt’s my job to make sure Allstate has the rightstrategy, people and infrastructure to seize ourmarket opportunities. This enables us to win inthe marketplace and deliver the value youexpect. Sometimes, that means taking a boldnew direction, as we did five years ago whenwe reorganized our agency distribution system,significantly increased our investment in technologyand initiated more sophisticated TieredPricing. Since then, we’ve stayed the course,and the results have been terrific. Over the lastfive years, you have seen compound annualgrowth rates of 11.2 percent in operatingincome per diluted share and 19.0 percentin your common stock total return.In 2004 we focused on several key areas toimprove profitability, increase scale and financialstrength and capture a larger share of theinsurance and financial services marketplace.More precise underwriting helps us segmentcustomers, better match the premiums individualspay for the risks they represent and win profitablemarket share. We continue to refine ourTiered Pricing models, which include ourStrategic Risk Management (SRM) tool, adding5Allstate is growing its share of high lifetime valuecustomers. We’re paying special attention to thosecustomers with favorable claim histories. And we’retargeting underserved middle-income consumers whohave a growing need for retirement-oriented financialservices products.ManagingfinancialexposureServingmultiplemarketsegmentsDiverse,competitivelypriced productsAggressive,focusedmarketingOver one million autoinsurance customersswitched to Allstate in2004.

TieredPricing helps us attract customers that have thepotential to generate greater value over time, sowe can compete vigorously for their business. Aswe gain market share within this segment andmanage expenses carefully, we’re steadily buildinga higher quality, increasingly profitable propertyand casualty portfolio. The evidence: steadyincome growth and a Property-Liability combinedratio that improved to 93.0 percent in 2004 from94.6 percent in 2003. We expect to continue tobenefit from our Tiered Pricing as it expands forboth auto and homeowners in 2005.Allstate’s superior claim management sharpensour competitive edge in two important ways. Itcreates loyalty by forging strong bonds withconsumers during their time of need. It alsoprotects our company’s assets – and contributesto profitability – by more effectivelymanaging loss costs, keeping those costsbelow industry averages. In 2004 we deliveredon our claim promises, improving our claim satisfactionratings while sustaining our severityadvantage versus the industry overall. Andsince 1996 our bodily injury claim experiencehas averaged 14 points lower than the industryoverall, a significant competitive advantage. Thisperformance testifies to our efficient claimoperations, but it’s not enough. Our NextGeneration Claim System program, now underdevelopment, will help us build on our alreadystrong claim performance while also giving customersan even better claim experience.Allstate Protection’s powerful distributionengine gives us the scale to reach consumersacross the country. In 2004 we invested innational and local marketing and advertising toraise our visibility and drive sales across ourexclusive agent, independent agent and directchannels. We worked on several fronts tosupport some 70,000 employees, agencyowners and their licensed sales professionals,and financial specialists whose knowledgeand experience we depend on to exceed ourcustomers’ expectations.For example, to reinforce our relationship withexclusive agents, we established an agencyadvisory board to help us solve key businessissues. We restructured their compensationplans to better align agency success with thecompany’s mission. We invested in education,technology and operational support to helpthem grow their agencies. The increase in exclusiveagents and support staff of 11.7 percent in2004 demonstrates that Allstate delivers astrong value proposition to our agency channel.We also expanded our relationships withindependent agents. This segment of the marketcurrently generates approximately one-third of allU.S. personal lines premiums. Simpler processesand highly competitive pricing will help us win amuch greater share of their business.In addition, our direct channel – which complementsour exclusive agency network to deliverconvenience and local support – handled morethan 6.5 million sales or service calls, andsupported 32 million visits to allstate.com andmore than 8 million self-service transactions.At Allstate Financial, we have a growingopportunity to help middle- and upper-incomecustomers achieve long-term financial security.We have one of the strongest distributionnetworks in the industry – more than 13,000Allstate agents and Exclusive FinancialSpecialists, as well as nearly 50,000 producingbroker dealers, financial institutions, independentagents and financial advisors. They havehelped us become one of the largest companiesin the financial services industry, withmore than $94 billion in assets. In 2004 weachieved record retail, institutional and totalPowerfuldistributionengineSuperior claimmanagementPreciseunderwritingand riskmanagementBuildingAllstateFinancialEnhancingthecustomerexperienceWe have defined a consistent strategy to become betterand bigger by achieving operating efficiencies anddriving profitable growth. And we continue to broadenour relationship with customers. We have been executingthis strategy with relentless discipline, and these effortsare rewarding you with steady performance.8There is more thanone way to deliver great value.That’s our stand.Premiums and Deposits. New sales of financialproducts by Allstate exclusive agenciesincreased 24.0 percent to $2.27 billion in2004, and have grown at a compound annualrate of 53.0 percent since 2000. And we madesolid progress toward becoming an operationallyexcellent product manufacturer, thusestablishing a strong foundation to accelerateprofitable growth. We will continue to make iteasier to do business with us and focus onfewer products that are developed from a commonplatform to achieve greater scale andprofitability. We will also deepen relationshipswith our most profitable and productive distributionpartners, streamline processes andleverage technology to improve overalleffectiveness and efficiency. We expect thisstrategy – of simplifying, standardizing andstrengthening our business – will help usachieve the necessary scale to increaseoperating income in the future.A Leader in ValueAllstate is a company that does much more thancollect money, settle claims and return a profit.Each year, we find new ways to create lastingvalue for the shareholders, customers and communitieswe serve. The inherent customer valuethat our business delivers and the caring culturethat our work has created make us better corporatecitizens – and a better and more valuablecompany.When thinking about lasting value, investorsshould focus on our proven record of capitalmanagement, where we have demonstrated theability to invest in areas that will drive growthand generate solid returns. Here, Allstate hasan exceptional track record. Since our initialpublic offering in 1993 through the end of2004, the total shareholder return on our stockhas averaged 13.7 percent on a compoundannual basis. Equally impressive, over the sameperiod the total value of Allstate’s return toshareholders exceeded both the Standard &Poor’s Property & Casualty and Standard &Poor’s 500 indices. That’s solid evidence thatwe are using shareholders’ equity effectively todeliver profitable returns and strong earnings,and that we are managing a company built forlong-term value.Investors and regulators also value Allstate’scommitment to sound governance and financialtransparency. The exemplary governancepractices adopted by our board of directorsare reflected in the very solid rankings andreports we receive from third-party governancerating services. We also benefit from a seniormanagement team whose actions set a tone ofintegrity, accountability and discipline that runsthroughout our company. Our strong corporatereputation has served the company well in theface of fast-changing business, legislative andregulatory environments.We are equally proud of the value we create bygiving back to the people and communities weserve. For example, the company matched contributionsby its employees, agents and agencystaff of some $760,000, to bring the totalAllstate donations to more than $1.5 millionfor the tsunami disaster recovery efforts inSoutheast Asia. The future of our society –and of our company – depends on stable communitiesthat nurture individual achievement.Allstate makes a difference by helping buildsafe and vital communities; by paving the wayfor economic empowerment; and by encouraginggreater tolerance, inclusion and diversity.At December 31, 2004, we had more than $30.5billion invested in municipal bonds and low-interestloans to strengthen urban communities. ThroughThe Allstate Foundation, we provided some $14million in grants to 700 not-for-profit organizationsacross the country. In addition, Allstate agenciesawarded Foundation grants to more than1,800 local community organizations. And ouremployees and agents volunteered their time andtalents to thousands of national and local causes.ContinuouslyimprovingresultsWise capitalmanagementGovernanceand financialtransparencyCommitted tocommunityAllstate measures value in many ways. We havegenerated long-term financial value for shareholders bymanaging and investing our capital responsibly. Wecreate value for communities by understanding whatmatters and by showing we care. In the process, we forgelong-term relationships with customers.In Florida, we put our caringculture on display inmany ways. We logged75,000 overtime hours incall centers, created25,000 claim reports andcut 42,000 checks. Wealso gave teddy bears tohundreds of kids to startthe healing.▼9Dan HaleSenior Vice President andChief Financial OfficerDevelops financialstrategy and ensuressound governancepractices, adequatefinancial controls,appropriate reportingtransparency anddisciplined capitalmanagement.Joan M.
