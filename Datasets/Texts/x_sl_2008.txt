A Message from Our Chairman
United States Steel Corporation’s safety performance continued to improve throughout 2008. During the past five years, our global rate of recordable injuries has improved by 65 percent while our global days away from work rate has improved by 87 percent. These dramatic reductions in injury rates mean that fewer of our employees are being injured and significantly more return home safely to their families at the end of every workday. We remain steadfast in our belief that all incidents and injuries can be prevented, and with the engagement and commitment of our employees, we continue to move aggressively to achieve that goal and ensure that we continue to improve in 2009 despite the challenging business climate.
In 2008, United States Steel Corporation set new records for financial performance as the successful integration of our 2007 strategic acquisitions positioned us to realize substantial benefits from strong global market conditions during most of the year. Our North American flat-rolled business benefitted from our ability to convert excess slabs produced at U. S. Steel Canada, formerly Stelco Inc., into higher-margin flat-rolled products using the excess capacity of our domestic rolling mills and coating operations. Lone Star Technologies, Inc., a welded tubular manufacturer now part of U. S. Steel Tubular Products, exceeded the synergies we predicted, and our diverse tubular product line enhanced our ability to serve the energy industry, the largest

We continued to advance our workforce diversity and inclusion objectives. We exceeded our goals for training management employees in diversity, recruiting, and spending among women and minority suppliers. Among our strongest achievements was a 10 percent improvement in diversity recruiting rates from 2007 to 2008, the direct result of implementing a new recruiting structure and diversity recruiting practices.
Last year, we successfully negotiated new four-year labor agreements with our primary union, the United Steelworkers. The new contracts maintain the productivity improvements we achieved in previous negotiations and include well-deserved rewards for our employees, who were essential to our record performance over the past five years and are critical to our future.
Solid progress has been made on our plans to improve our raw materials position and to ensure long-term access to high-quality coke for our blast furnaces. We are well under way with our multiyear investment program at our Clairton Plant, where

 two new environmentally advanced by-product coke batteries that will be built over the next several years. We are also constructing a cogeneration facility at Granite City Works, which will generate electricity using steam from an adjacent, dedicated non-recovery coke battery being built by a third party. Both of these programs use the best available technologies to minimize environmental impact and to meet or exceed compliance with environmental requirements.
We are continuing to implement an Enterprise Resource Planning integrated software package, which will streamline, standardize and centralize our business processes and help us to maximize cost effectiveness, efficiency and control across our global operations.
In 2008, we spent $140 million to acquire the remaining interests in the Clairton (coke) 1314B partnership and to purchase three pickle lines adjacent to our Lake Erie Works in Canada. The pickling process removes dirt and scale from hot-rolled steel before it is shipped to customers or processed further.
We repurchased 2.0 million shares of common stock during the year for a total cost of $227 million. This brings our total repurchases to 16.3 million shares for approximately $1 billion and represents approximately 12 percent of the balance of fully diluted shares outstanding when we authorized the original repurchase program in July 2005. In light of the economic climate, we have suspended repurchases; however, 4.4 million shares remain available for repurchase under the current authorization. Like many resource, materials and manufacturing companies, our share price was dramatically affected by the downturn in the stock market following the onset of the global recession.
Our current capital spending plan for 2009 is approximately $740 million, excluding spending related to the non-recovery coke battery at Granite City, with $610 million for our North American operations and $130 million for our European operations.

 Significant North American capital projects for 2009 include construction of the new coke battery at our Clairton Plant and the completion of the cogeneration facility at Granite City Works mentioned earlier. In Europe, 2009 capital spending will focus largely on environmental projects. We intend to manage our spending on these and other smaller projects in a manner that reflects changes in market conditions and available cash flows.
In February 2009, approximately 500 employees, including several of our executives, elected to retire under the Voluntary Early Retirement Program we initiated as part of our cost reduction efforts. The company’s comprehensive succession planning and leadership development process have prepared the next generation of executives to lead our company, and these retirements provide a timely opportunity to restructure our workforce and our leadership team to meet our current business needs. On behalf of our Board of Directors, I want to extend my thanks to each of the retiring employees for their years of service and dedication to U. S. Steel and wish them the best for the future.

We do not know when conditions may improve, but we are well positioned to fully participate in a market recovery when it occurs. In the meantime, we will continue to employ a balanced and responsible approach to managing our company and will take additional actions as market conditions warrant to aggressively maximize liquidity and reduce costs. We thank you for your continued support of our company.
