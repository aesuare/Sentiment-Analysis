fellow shareholders, At Apache, exploring what's possible has many dimensions: discovering new resources, developing ways to operate more efficiently, innovating, and expanding markets.
It describes our commitment to delivering consistent profitable growth for the long-term benefit of our shareholders as we continue our evolution from a start-up drilling program company into an independent, international exploration and production company with a critical mass of acreage and production base in the United States, Australia, Canada, Egypt, the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea and Argentina. And, at a time of unprecedented change across the globe, it describes our culture, built on a sense of urgency, discipline, innovation and spirit. Exploring what's possible also frames the decisions we make to respond to changes in the near-term operating and economic environment.

In 2009, the dramatic decline in oil and gas prices and the global financial crisis provided the backdrop for our primary objective: to live within our reduced cash flow in order to preserve financial flexibility.
In the face of curtailed activity to achieve this objective, Apache delivered record annual average production--up 9 percent from 2008--and still added slightly more reserves than we produced, excluding revisions.

Lower oil and gas prices impacted Apache's financial results, requiring us to reduce the carrying value of oil and gas properties and resulting in a $1.98-billion non-cash aftertax charge to earnings during the first quarter. However, with rebounding oil prices and higher production, earnings strengthened throughout the remainder of the year, reducing Apache's net loss to $292 million or 87 cents per diluted common share for the year. Absent the write-down and other items that impact the comparability of results, Apache's adjusted earnings totaled $1.9 billion or $5.59 per share.* Cash flow from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities totaled $5 billion.* The catalyst for both our production growth and the rebound in our financial results was our portfolio approach, which provides for a balance of oil and natural gas production,

regional core areas and geological diversity. This offers multiple opportunities for growth and adaptation in an ever-changing environment. Our

financial flexibility, the result of years of hard work and discipline, permits Apache to pursue large-scale developments, higher-risk, higher-reward exploration and-- when appropriate--value-creating acquisitions.

Our current production base provides the cash flow required for the capital investments needed to develop our discoveries. For example, production from the Qasr Field--Apache's largest discovery--and commencement of production from the Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil developments in Australia will generate cash flow that will fund the next round of investments, including our participation in Chevron's Wheatstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) hub, which will provide a market for our Julimar and Brunello discoveries. Gas production in the Horn River Basin shale play in Canada is expected to begin ramping up as Apache's teams apply technological innovations to complete wells more quickly

and at lower cost. We are also planning an active horizontal drilling program in the Granite Wash tight sands play in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. Apache's investments in unconventional natural gas plays such as Horn River Basin and Granite Wash are parts of the larger expansion of gas resources that will provide North America with a way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. We anticipate that higher production will generate adequate cash flow to support our higher activity level compared to 2009. However, it appears to us that the economic recovery is fragile at best and the near-term global outlook is uncertain. We will review drilling and development capital on an ongoing basis and adjust to match conditions and our opportunity set. With $2 billion of cash and additional liquidity from our credit facilities, we have ample flexibility to pursue additional exploration activity or opportunistic value-adding acquisitions.

At Apache, key decisions, such as our establishing the objective of living within cash flow, are made by the Office of the Chief Executive Officer, based on our assessments of short-term external factors and long-term trends measured against Apache's strengths and capabilities. Because John Crum, Rod Eichler and Roger Plank focus on certain areas of the organization while maintaining a broad perspective, I value their insights as we make decisions to deploy capital and explore new opportunities. We have time-tested management systems that provide a uniform system of measuring success across Apache. New leadership in most of our regions and increased mobility for our technical personnel spreads our unique culture and strengthens our knowledge and experience. On a macro level, a number of trends are likely to have significant impact on the upstream oil and gas industry in the years to come:

We set goals for our stewardship commitments--from safe and environmentally responsible operations across our regions to improving the quality of life in our communities--just as we set goals for exploration and production activities and financial targets. In 2009, we achieved our goal of planting 1 million trees, and promptly established a new objective: planting 2 million more trees that will improve the quality of life in many communities.

We like to say we are exploring what's possible because it reflects who we are--challenging the status quo and adapting to changing circumstances while recognizing what works. Above all, we remain
dedicated to delivering results and growing a profitable global exploration and production company for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support.

Demand for our products will continue to grow, even in times of economic weakness, because billions of people are seeking to improve their living standards. In Asia, new cities--with skyscrapers, factories and unfathomable congestion--are sprouting up virtually overnight. In North America, the natural gas market has been transformed by recent improvements in horizontal drilling and completion technology that have opened up a 100-year resource with the potential to improve our energy security, create jobs and help achieve environmental and climate-change goals. Concern about the environment and climate change will result in policy changes that will affect the way energy is used and the way we operate.
Apache's culture thrives on challenges such as these and others--seeking larger exploration targets, investigating new markets, or innovating to improve our exploratory results and reduce costs.
