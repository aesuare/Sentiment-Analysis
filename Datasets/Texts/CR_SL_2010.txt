letter to shareholders

purchased in December for approximately $90 million. Its product line fits nicely within our existing Payment Solutions business, which has very good margins and excellent growth prospects. It strengthens our market position, particularly in the gaming and retail sectors, including self-checkout applications. As part of a balanced capital deployment strategy, we returned cash to shareholders through the repurchase of $50 million of our common stock and made a discretionary pension fund contribution of $25 million. Reflecting our improved earnings and ample cash flow, we raised the quarterly dividend 15% to 23¢ in July. Our balance sheet remains strong with $273 million in cash, a net debt to net capitalization ratio of 11%, unused credit lines of $300 million, and no near-term debt maturities. Our efforts in 2010 and prospects for 2011 were recognized by investors, as Crane Co.'s total shareholder return in 2010 was 38% versus 15% for the S&P 500 and 35% for the S&P MidCap 400 Industrial Machinery Index. In 2011, we are expanding our initiatives to drive further profitable growth. We are using our operational excellence tools to enhance the capabilities and effectiveness of our sales and marketing activities, as we deepen our knowledge of ever-changing customer needs and market verticals. We are identifying key productivity initiatives to drive improvement in material and other costs, and we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach to pricing, based not only on increased material costs, but also on the overall value proposition we offer our customers. These initiatives should allow us to increase our operating margin to 13% when revenues return to the peak $2.6 billion levels of 2007 and 2008, well above the comparable margins achieved in those years. Uncommon Leverage In response to the economic downturn in 2008 and 2009, we tactically reduced the manufacturing footprint and cost base of the Company, while maintaining the ability to ramp up production when the economy recovers. In 2009, we reduced costs by $175 million, with restructuring savings of approximately $40 million, a reduction of $45 million of engineering spending in our Aerospace Group and $90 million of other cost reductions. In 2010, we further reduced spending across the Company, driven by a $23 million decrease in Aerospace engineering spending as several key development programs were completed. This significant reduction of our cost base provides us with an opportunity to apply "uncommon leverage"­ as our sales increase with the recovering economy, we expect to see significant increases in our operating profit and earnings. In fact, we experienced this in 2010, when our earnings per share increased 14% (21% before Special Items) on a sales increase of only 1% (2% before Special Items). Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures table on page 4 for further details of Special Items.

Dear Shareholder: Crane Co.'s 2010 performance outpaced our initial expectations by a wide margin. Earnings per share of $2.59 substantially exceeded the guidance in last year's annual report of $2.15 to $2.35, reflecting significant improvement in our business over the course of the year. We have emerged from the economic downturn both tested and stronger, and Crane is now firmly positioned for profitable growth in 2011 and beyond. Our strategy during the past two years has been to utilize our substantial cash balance and liquidity position to fund key initiatives to accelerate our growth as market demand returns. We have focused on developing new technologies and products; enhancing our global sales, marketing and engineering capabilities; and driving continuous process improvement across the Company. At the same time, we have been relentless in our focus on our customer-facing metrics such as lead time and on-time delivery, and we are leveraging volume on a lower cost base. Because we stayed on offense through the downturn, we have taken market share in key markets, and we expect further gains as the economy recovers. With the margin improvement we have achieved in 2010, the progress we have made is evident. I see the late-cycle nature of many of our businesses as an advantage, as it means that the best is yet to come in our Fluid Handling and Aerospace businesses. Our strategy continues to be to use excess cash to make acquisitions that strengthen existing businesses. Executing this strategy over the last ten years has resulted in approximately half of our 2010 sales coming from businesses we acquired during that period. In 2010, we made two exciting acquisitions. Merrimac Industries, now part of our Electronics Group, was acquired in February for approximately $54 million and increased the size of our Microwave business by approximately 50%. It had its best quarter of the year in the fourth quarter of 2010 and is positioned for further profitable growth in 2011 and 2012. Money Controls, a leading producer of a broad range of payment systems and associated products for the gaming, amusement, transportation, and retail markets, was

Review of Operations Total sales in 2010 were $2.218 billion, an increase of 1% from $2.196 billion in 2009. Excluding Special Items, 2010 sales increased $40 million, or 2%, resulting from a core sales increase of $31 million (2%), favorable foreign currency translation of $7 million and an increase in sales from acquired businesses (net of divestitures) of $2 million. Operating profit for the full year 2010 increased 13% to $235 million compared with $208 million in 2009, and our operating profit margin increased to 10.6%, compared with 9.5% in 2009. Excluding Special Items, 2010 operating profit increased 19% to $243 million compared with $204 million in 2009, and operating profit margin increased to 11.0%, compared with 9.4% in 2009. Full year 2010 earnings per diluted share increased 14% to $2.59, compared with $2.28 in 2009. Excluding Special Items, 2010 earnings per diluted share increased 21% to $2.59 compared with $2.15 in 2009. The Aerospace & Electronics, Engineered Materials and Controls segments all contributed to the increase in operating profit and earnings, partially offset by declines in the Merchandising Systems and Fluid Handling segments. Aerospace & Electronics Sales for the Aerospace & Electronics segment declined primarily because of the positive impact of the Boeing agreement in 2009. Aerospace sales momentum dramatically improved in the second half of 2010, aided by improved airline profitability. Electronics sales were relatively flat on a full-year basis, with the positive impact of the Merrimac acquisition offsetting the negative impact of the GTC divestiture. Electronics had a very strong fourth quarter and ended the year with a solid backlog position. We expect favorable trends in the aerospace industry, as well as our position as a supplier to the Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) portion of the military market, to be positive influences in 2011. Engineered Materials Sales and operating profit in the Engineered Materials segment increased in 2010, driven by higher sales to our traditional early-cycle recreational vehicle and transportation customers. We experienced raw material cost headwinds, particularly in the second half of 2010, and we have already implemented price increases which took effect in the first quarter of 2011 to offset this impact. We plan to grow sales and operating profit in 2011 and beyond, as we capitalize on market share gains in recovering markets and continue to develop new applications for our products.

Merchandising Systems Sales of the Merchandising Systems segment increased slightly, reflecting generally soft end markets. An increase in vending was partially offset by a modest decline in payment solutions. Our results in 2011 are expected to benefit from recovery of our end markets, particularly in payment solutions. We continue to develop technologies to modernize the vending experience for consumers and to optimize delivery economics for route operators. Fluid Handling Sales of the Fluid Handling segment were lower in 2010. In general, MRO (Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul) sales increased modestly, while project-related sales declined. Our late-cycle Energy business experienced lower sales throughout the year, as project activity remained sluggish. ChemPharma sales were down in the first three quarters of the year but showed an increase in the fourth quarter, as the chemical industry continued to recover. Other business units in the segment, including our UK-based Building Services and Utilities unit, and Crane Supply, our pipe, valve and fitting distribution business based in Canada, registered sales increases in 2010. Our vertical market focus is driving new customer solutions, and product bundling and new product developments are contributing to market share gains. Controls A recovery in transportation and upstream oil and gas related demand drove improved results, as did the absence of losses from businesses divested in 2010. We are projecting continued growth in sales and profits of the Controls segment as key end markets continue to recover. 2011 Outlook We are expecting revenue and profit growth across all of our segments. Sales for 2011 are projected to increase 7-9%, driven by a core sales increase of 4-5%, sales from businesses acquired in 2010 (net of divestitures) of 2-3% and favorable foreign exchange of approximately 1%. Our 2011 earnings guidance is a range of $2.80 $3.00 per diluted share, an increase of 8-16% compared with 2010. Our favorable 2011 outlook reflects the combined efforts of all our employees, "Everyone, Everywhere," to improve execution and position Crane for profitable growth. I want to thank all of them, as well as our Board of Directors, for their many contributions to the success of this Company, of which I am so proud. I would like to add a special thank you to retiring director Charles J. Queenan, Jr. for his twenty-five years of distinguished service. His wise counsel has been invaluable to me. Sincerely,

Eric C. Fast
