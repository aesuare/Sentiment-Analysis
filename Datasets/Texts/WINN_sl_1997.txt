1997 was a year of positioning Winn-Dixie for the future. As we approach the millennium, we are better prepared than ever for the years ahead.

Winn-Dixie 1997 Annual Report

To better serve our customers, we have been rebuilding and improving our facilities. Over 68% of our stores are new, enlarged or remodeled in the last five years. Our average store size is now 40,700 square feet. And we are continuing to add services to give our customers the finest one-stop shopping experience in the supermarket industry. We are creating a Winn-Dixie unlike any before. An exciting place to shop with sparkling new store interiors, expanded services, abundant variety, friendly individual attention and real value, based on high quality and low prices. While this affected our earnings for 1997, we remain excited and confident about our direction. Our results for 1997 reflect our underlying strength. Record sales of $13.2 billion. Net earnings of $204.4 million. And a 54th year of consecutive dividend increases, maintaining our New York Stock Exchange record. Customer First The supermarket business is a customer satisfaction business. The satisfied customer is the key to everything we do, no less today than when the Davis family founded Winn-Dixie 72 years ago. We call this philosophy "Customer First." And it means exactly what it says. Satisfying customers is our first order of business, the driving force for all we do. The New Winn-Dixie To attract and keep customers, we are upgrading our services and facilities companywide. This investment for the future is part of our strategy to encourage all shoppers to visit our stores, whether or not they have previously shopped at Winn-Dixie. People who visit our locations today after being away for a while are often pleasantly surprised by what they encounter. The milestones we reached in 1997 tell the story. Winn-Dixie opened 83 new stores during the year. We enlarged or remodeled another 79 stores. And we closed 87 smaller stores. As a result, at year end, we had 1,174 stores with retail space of more than 47.8 million square feet, an increase of 4.6 percent over 1996. More than 80 percent of our business is now done in our Marketplace locations. Over 72 percent of our stores have the new teal/rose decor. Only 283 stores are less than 35,000 square feet. And in 1998 we plan to open another 80 new stores and enlarge or remodel 90 more. In 1997 we also opened our 544th pharmacy, one more sign of the array of services conveniently available to Winn-Dixie customers. At year end, 167 of our stores had banks, and we expect to open another 150 in-store banks in the next two years. Today, more stores have one-hour photo labs, dry cleaning services, floral shops and other services than ever before. And we are continually introducing new services - such as UPS parcel drop-off and cellular phone booths at some locations - to keep current with our customers' busy lifestyles. Today's Winn-Dixie shoppers can make purchases with both debit and credit cards. We also have implemented electronic benefit transfer (EBT) systems in four states to help customers who depend on food stamps and other assistance programs, with five more states scheduled to be added in 1998. To support our new and improved stores, we continued to strengthen our entire operation in 1997. Another 100 new trucks and almost 250 trailers were added to our fleet during the year. We increasingly used advanced technology to make our retail support centers (warehouses) more efficient - with new centers being built in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Montgomery, Alabama, and an enlarged center already operating in Orlando, Florida. To help keep expenses down, we are enlarging our corporate headquarters facilities in Jacksonville, Florida, to allow us to bring all departments into one building that will have state-of-the-art automated information and communication systems. To keep our customers first, we are building for the future. Winn-Dixie Volunteers We are proud of the thousands of Winn-Dixie associates who volunteer their time to improve their communities. The work they do to mentor young people, to promote good health, to strengthen education and to pitch-in during natural disasters is often done quietly, without fanfare. A salute goes to our outstanding associates who received our annual Founders Awards as Associate Good Citizens of the Year in their divisions: Imagene Earwood, Atlanta; Ruth Taylor and Calvin Barr, Charlotte; Don Kleinosky, Jacksonville; Larry Lemoine, New Orleans; Alfred Rudolph, Miami; Amy Sue Bradbury and Carolyn Tuttle-Mueller, Midwest; James Rupp, Tampa; LaSayde Crew, Orlando; Carl Petway, Raleigh; and James Fitzgerald, Ft. Worth.

Winn-Dixie 1997 Annual Report

We also want to extend special thanks to our associates who provided relief to families affected by the hurricanes, tornadoes and floods during the past year. When their friends and neighbors were most in need, these associates came through. This year Winn-Dixie gave more than $11.5 million to support customer and associate efforts on behalf of their communities. Included in this amount were matching grants which effectively doubled our associates' own generous donations of $1.9 million to their favorite civic and charitable organizations. Construction was begun in the spring of 1997 for the new Winn-Dixie Hope Lodge in Atlanta, Georgia. Our Hope Lodges including those in Miami and Gainesville, Florida - give cancer outpatients and a family member a home-like place to stay at no charge near the site of treatment. Our associates make a difference in many ways. Through their individual good deeds. And through the time they volunteer to organized programs like food banks, blood drives, the Special Olympics and recreation for inner city areas. To all of them, we say: You make us proud! In Recognition We want to acknowledge the valuable service of two members of the Winn-Dixie management team who retired in 1997. E. T. Walters, Senior Vice President and Regional Director of our Miami and Orlando Divisions and our Bahamian operations, retired after 38 years of service. J. R. Pownall, President of our Atlanta Division, retired after 42 years of service. We thank them for their loyalty and dedication to Winn-Dixie. Our heartfelt sympathy goes to the family and friends of R. D. (Ron) Buday, President of our Orlando Division, who passed away on November 14, 1996. Ron was a devoted colleague we will always fondly remember. Our Future Putting the customer first is not just the way we do business today. It is a sound strategy for our future. It will continue to be the foundation for all we do. We thank all of our associates, shareholders, business partners and customers for their support in 1997 as we achieved our 63rd straight year of sales increases. With our improved facilities, our dedicated associates, our strong financial position and our commitment to the customer, we have never been better poised to reach new heights. Powerful consumer and market trends are reshaping today's supermarket industry. And thanks to all of you, we believe our future as a leader in that industry is bright!
