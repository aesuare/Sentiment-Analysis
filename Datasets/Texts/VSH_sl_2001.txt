TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, AND VENDORS:
YEAR 2001
While year 2000 was by far the most successful for Vishay, 2001 has been the most difficult year in the forty-year history of the Company. Due to the depressed worldwide electronics markets, our sales for the year 2001 were 33% below those of the extraordinary year 2000. As a result, we reduced the number of employees (before our General Semiconductor acquisition) by 6,000 during the year 2001; furthermore, we consolidated and closed some facilities and reduced expenses wherever possible.
At the same time, however, during 2001 we have made strategic moves to strengthen the Company and, I believe, have made the Company stronger today than it was one year ago.
• In June 2001, the Company paid off its long-term bank debt when it received $294 million from the sale of zero-coupon convertible subordinated notes due 2021. This move enabled the Company to significantly strengthen its cash position and balance sheet.
• In July 2001, the Company announced its acquisition of the entire infrared components business of Infineon Technologies AG for approximately $116 million. In fiscal year 2000,
Infineon’s infrared components business had revenues of approximately $133 million. With this acquisition, the Company now becomes the world’s largest manufacturer of the transceiver modules that enable short-range connectivity among and between notebook computers, cell phones, PDAs, printers, and other devices. We also now become the second largest worldwide manufacturer of optocouplers used in many electronic devices and the largest manufacturer of infrared remote control transmitter modules.
• In November 2001, the Company acquired General Semiconductor, Inc., a leading manufacturer of power management devices. We are very excited about this acquisition. With this acquisition completed, Vishay becomes the #2 manufacturer of discrete semiconductors worldwide and the #1 manufacturer of diodes and rectifiers worldwide. The complementary nature of our product lines should result in substantial operational and marketing synergies and provide significantly more opportunities for additional cost savings. Vishay’s strong balance sheet, coupled with General Semiconductor’s reputation and market presence, should create an ideal platform for further growth through acquisitions in the semiconductor components market. Stockholders of General
A MESSAGE FROM THE CHAIRMAN
 We will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities to facilitate the growth of our business and to strengthen our position in the markets we serve. This is consistent with Vishay’s historic ability to maintain
a competitive edge throughout economic cycles.
In the year 2002 and beyond, we will continue to build on our position as a leader in the U.S., European and Asian electronic markets.

Semiconductor received 0.563 of a share of Vishay’s common stock for each General Semiconductor share, or a value of $10.74 per General Semiconductor share based on Vishay’s November 1, 2001 closing price of $19.08. General Semiconductor had sales of $494 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
• In November 2001, the Company announced the acquisition of North American Capacitor Company (NACC), also known as Mallory. Mallory is a manufacturer of wet tantalum electrolytic capacitors, among other products. In the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, Mallory had sales of approximately $44 million. The acquisition of Mallory has resulted in Vishay becoming the largest producer of wet tantalum capacitors.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
For the year ended December 31, 2001, sales were $1,655,346,000 compared to sales of $2,465,066,000 in the previous year, a decrease of 33%. Before restructuring charges and other nonrecurring items of $118,776,000, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $119,289,000 or $0.84 per share compared to net earnings of $517,864,000 or $3.77 per share for the year ended December 31, 2000. After the restructuring charges and other non-
recurring items, net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $513,000 or $0.00 per share.
Despite the weak worldwide economic environment, the Company continued to generate cash from operations during year 2001. In fact, for the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company’s cash flow from operations were $161,418,000. Purchases of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $162,493,000 and depreciation and amortization expense for the same period was $163,387,000.
As previously stated, in June 2001, the Company paid off its long-term bank debt when it received $294 million from the sale of zero-coupon convertible subordinated notes due 2021. As a result of this transaction and subsequent acquisitions, the long- term debt of the Company was $605,031,000 at December 31, 2001 and the stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2001 was $2,366,545,000 resulting in a debt to equity ratio of 0.26. In addition, our cash balance at December 31, 2001 was $367,115,000.
LOOKING AHEAD
While year 2000 was an extraordinary year, we foresaw at that time a downturn for the year 2001. As we stated in last year’s Annual Report, “2001 will

be a time for adjustment. We hope that this period of adjustment, characterized by customer inventory reductions, reduction in market demand, and order cancellations, will be temporary. However, this lower market profile will provide new opportunities for Vishay to leverage its strong financial position and aggressively pursue new acquisitions.” This is, in fact, what we accomplished during 2001. As a result of our acquisition strategy, we now have a company that has been transformed from being only in passive components to one that is now split in sales almost evenly between passive components and discrete semiconductors. Looking ahead, we believe this will enable the Company to grow its sales and net earnings faster than if we had stayed strictly a company in passive components.
We believe that the worst is behind us. We have continued to see improvements in orders in our discrete semiconductor (active) business. We believe that this is a sign of the beginning of a recovery in the semiconductor business and hope that our passive component business will follow suit as it did in previous recessions where the semiconductor sector was the first to recover.
We will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities to facilitate the growth of our business and to strengthen our position in the markets we serve. This is consistent with Vishay’s historic ability to maintain a competitive edge throughout economic cycles. In the year 2002 and beyond, we will continue to build on our position as a leader in the U.S., European and Asian electronic markets. We look with confidence and optimism towards the future when the electronic markets will recover.
We are extremely grateful to our employees worldwide for their loyalty, skill, and energy, which have contributed significantly to our growth. We value highly the relationships we have with our customers and suppliers. To our fellow stockholders, we thank you for your continued confidence in Vishay. We look forward to meeting the challenges ahead.
Sincerely,
