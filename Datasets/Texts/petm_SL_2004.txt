Dear

Shareholders
As we reflect on our successes of 2004, and look ahead to 2005 and beyond, we can't help but think how fortunate we are to be in this business, with its strong emotional attachments, great fundamentals, favorable demographic and psychographic trends and one of the fastest growth rates in retail. On the strength of our Total Lifetime CareTM strategy and solid market fundamentals, we completed yet another strong year with diluted earnings per-share growth of 23.9 percent, top line sales growth of 12.4 percent, comparable store sales growth of 6.3 percent on top of 7.0 percent in 2003, and industry leading sales per square foot of $205. But these are mere numbers. At their core are stories written in our stores each day by our associates and customers. You've just read about some of them. They are stories of connections made, relationships formed, knowledge shared and solutions delivered. They are the very heart of our brand, the heart of our business. They help validate our research showing that customers increasingly identify PETsMART as the place that has the best solutions for taking care of their pet. In 2004, we provided even more opportunities to deliver those solutions. We added 83 net new stores for a total of 726 and will open an additional 100 net new stores in 2005, representing square footage growth of about 12 percent. About one-third of those new stores will be located in the Northeast and California, with the remaining to be located in the nation's biggest markets, where we still have plenty of room to grow. We presently believe the market can support 1,400 stores, a number we revised upward by 200 stores in 2004. Our services business, where we are the largest and fastest growing in the industry, also remains a top initiative. We're continuing to develop our grooming, training and PETsHOTEL businesses, and we're finding new adjacencies that also can deliver solid shareholder returns. We are consolidating this highly fragmented business and creating new markets by exposing these services to customers who never have used them before. Pet services are an engine of profitable growth and a powerful differentiator. We grew this segment of our business by more than 20 percent in 2004, the fifth straight year of such growth. We project similar growth through at least 2006. Services revenue as a percentage of core store sales continued to increase, reaching 7.2 percent in 2004, up from 4.8 percent in 2001.

We transitioned our PETsMART PETsHOTELSM test in 2004 to a full-scale rollout, ending the year with 16 of the overnight boarding facilities. We will open 12 more PETsHOTELs inside our stores in 2005 and another 20 in 2006 on the way to an ultimate buildout of 270. Using what we have learned from the Doggie Day Camps in our existing hotels, we initiated a test of a stand-alone Doggie Day CampTM inside our Pasadena, Calif., store in late 2004. Initial results have been positive and we plan to expand that test in up to five more stores in 2005. We've worked hard to earn our customers' trust. And we're committed to keep it that way. That's why operating excellence is a key strategic focus for us in 2005. As our existing stores mature, and we continue to add new ones at a rapid pace, we know we have to continue to deliver consistently the promises inherent in our brand. These are the basics such as understanding customers' needs and delivering solutions, store appearance, short checkout lines, in-stocks and employing passionate, well-trained associates.

The PetPerks® savings card, our customer relationship marketing program, has exceeded our expectations since its launch in 2004. The initial results were so positive we accelerated the rollout so we'll have all of our stores fully enrolled by mid-2005. Then we'll shift our focus to analyzing the customer data captured by the program, and we'll continue to test a series of campaigns targeted to the specific needs of our customers and their pets. We continue to maintain a firm grip on inventories and to further strengthen our balance sheet. Our cash reserves and our ongoing ability to generate cash--we generated $283 million in cash from operations in 2004, an increase of $37 million over 2003--give us tremendous financial flexibility to invest in profitable growth and our own company. On that note, in 2005 we will complete a board authorized buy-back of $150 million of our stock, 30 percent of which was completed by the end of 2004.

We're proud of our accomplishments in 2004. The core business continues to perform well, leaving us extremely optimistic about this business and its ability to grow and gain share. We look forward with great excitement to 2005 and beyond, confident in our ability to take advantage of this growing industry, to further differentiate ourselves from our competition and to return value to our shareholders. We have the mind, the will and the heart to do it. Sincerely,

Philip L. Francis Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
