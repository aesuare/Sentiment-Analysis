Letter to our Shareholders
Stuart A. Miller
President and Chief Executive Officer Lennar Corporation
 Dear Shareholders:
2008 was a year of continued progress for our Company in perhaps the most challenging housing market we have ever encountered. Lennar’s Management Team and Associates made progress by carefully managing our asset base, rebuilding our primary homebuilding business and reworking our joint ventures. Even against the backdrop of falling national home prices, we made progress toward achieving stability, which will ultimately enable us to return to profitability.
Consistent with our long-standing strategy, the focus on our balance sheet continued to be our top priority. That meant:
• Maximizing our cash position by generating positive operating cash flows of $1.1 billion
• Enhancing our balance sheet liquidity with a homebuilding cash position of $1.1 billion and $251 million of cash received subsequent to year end related to a tax loss carryback
• Managing our inventory by reducing starts and using below market financing and incentives to sell homes and reduce cancellations
• Properly stating our land assets, and reducing land purchases and development costs
• Ending the year with a homebuilding debt to total capital position of 49.2%, and a homebuilding debt to total capital position, net of cash, of 35.7%
We have made continued progress throughout 2008 on improving our homebuilding operating platform as we:
• Re-engineered our product offering in all of our markets across the country
• Reduced the number of floor plans to increase efficiency
• Re-bid labor and materials to reduce costs
• Continued to right size our overhead in each of
our operating divisions and our corporate office
• Improved gross margins from home sales excluding valuation adjustments to 17.0% from 13.9%, which resulted in a return to a positive operating margin from home sales excluding valuation adjustments of 1.2%
We have remained focused on reducing the Company’s off-balance sheet joint venture exposure by:
• Decreasing the number of our joint ventures to 116 from 270 at the peak in 2006
• Reducing maximum recourse indebtedness to $520 million from $1.8 billion at its peak in 2006
Although we made significant progress in 2008, our results reflect the daunting market conditions our Company continues to navigate:
• Revenues of $4.6 billion – down 55%
• Loss per share of $7.00. This includes a $2.41 per share charge related to valuation adjustments and other write-offs, as well as a $4.61 per share charge related to a non-cash deferred tax asset
valuation allowance
• Homebuilding operating loss of $401 million • Deliveries of 15,735 homes – down 53%
As we enter a new year, economic conditions have worsened and the housing industry remains depressed. With overall weak consumer confidence, fewer potential home purchasers are willing to enter the market. Additionally, broad-based external pressures have continued to negatively impact housing:
• Home prices and sales volumes continue to decline as general economic pressures fuel a downward spiral
• Growing unemployment and economic instability are weighing heavily on potential buyers and impeding homebuying decisions
• Foreclosures continue to add inventory to an already saturated market

• Restrictive mortgage lending practices have reduced the pool of potential new homebuyers
• Distressed sellers are prone to accept discounted offers to move inventory, thus driving prices down even further
• Capital markets remain frozen as bank balance sheets continue to be negatively impacted by falling asset values
The problems that have dragged down the homebuilding industry have now brought the overall U.S. economy into a severe recession. We believe continued government action will be necessary until it provides a meaningful fix for the economy. These actions should be the catalyst to reverse the industry- wide downturn, leading to an eventual recovery.
In spite of these challenging conditions, we continue to make progress on our go-forward strategy relative to our overall Company structure. In prior down cycles, Lennar has created meaningful shareholder value by using the cycle as our ally as we took advantage of dislocation in the marketplace. Once again, we have been preparing to be a participant in identifying and profiting from distress opportunities that naturally present themselves in down cycles. We have incubated a management team that will be exclusively focused on distress opportunities as they are presented. This independent team has now launched a program to raise third-party capital to focus on the significant dislocation in residential assets.
Our primary operating strategy going forward will be to continue to reduce assets and focus on a pure homebuilding manufacturing model. We will continue to fine-tune operating efficiencies to improve margins while primarily purchasing finished homesites on an as-needed basis. This homebuilding manufacturing program will focus on generating positive operating cash flows and high returns on capital. We are confident that as the market recovers, we will be able to create meaningful shareholder value with this business model.
As we look ahead to 2009, the opportunities for the Company lie with our continued emphasis on improving our balance sheet, fine-tuning our operating platform and reducing our joint ventures while additionally participating in the opportunities presented through market dislocation in a distressed environment. While we are not projecting when the market will stabilize, we remain optimistic about our business model and the housing market in general. The housing sector led the way into this recession and it is our belief that housing will lead the way out. As we find stabilization and ultimately recovery, Lennar will be well positioned to return to profitability and create meaningful shareholder value.
Sincerely,
Stuart A. Miller
President and Chief Executive Officer Lennar Corporation
