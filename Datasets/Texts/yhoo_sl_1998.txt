I’m proud to report that 1998 was another successful year for Yahoo!. In 1998, we continued to carefully manage the business and invest in aggressively growing our leadership position while delivering consistently increasing profits on a pro forma basis, and value to our users, customers, and shareholders.We built an increasingly stronger business by anticipating, affecting, and adapting to the remarkable growth and changes in the industry. As the Internet has grown and changed, so has Yahoo!, with our foremost focus being on serving the needs of our customers worldwide.
Since the formation of Yahoo!, we have been relentless in building Yahoo! into the only place anyone in the world would have to go to find and get connected
to anything or anybody. It encompasses a broad vision and allows us numerous ways to aggressively grow our business. As an independent, comprehensive global branded network of Web properties and services, Yahoo! is a leader in delivering the widest choice of content and services available to Internet users. We have built a powerful platform used by advertisers, merchants, and content providers to reach large, targeted audiences to grow their businesses in partnership with us. Yahoo! is the provider of choice when users, advertisers, and
merchants want to find, buy, sell, or send something on the Web.
We have always been very focused on acquiring and retaining as large and as
broad a global audience as possible. By strategic choice, we have remained
independent with regard to the content or merchant services we aggregate on
behalf of our worldwide users. Users highly value choice, and our unique position
is that of the independent, open aggregator of anything and everything
users could want to find and get connected to.
The core of our strategy has been to build a platform business that satisfies
the needs of the largest global audience possible, and in a way that has Yahoo! increasingly woven into their lives.We have always reasoned that if we were to
be successful in doing this, we would have millions of people coming to Yahoo!
on a daily basis, showing us exactly what they found most popular.We would
then use actual consumption patterns to address their needs for content,
merchant services, and communication services. The result is a powerful, selfreinforcing distribution platform for an ever-increasing array of content,
communication services, and merchant services. It also drives a great business
model when well managed.
1998 results
It’s very much an understatement when I say that the industry has grown and
changed a lot during 1998! By analyst measurements, in 1998 the number of
regular Web users grew to 142 million and the total dollars spent on Web

advertising was about double that of 1997. And, 1998 appears to be the first
“critical mass” year in online business-to-consumer commerce. Internet connectivity became more ubiquitous, both at work and at home, PC shipments were
up substantially, and “Internet connectivity” became a primary driver when consumers decided to buy a PC.
Throughout 1998, Yahoo! continued to focus on leadership, scale, leverage, and
the delivery of superior financial results.We started the year with one of the
Web’s most well-known brands and a large audience share, and we exited the
year with the same strong position.We ended 1997 with approximately 26
million unique users in the U.S., and in December 1998, we had more than 50 million unique users worldwide, a result of Yahoo!’s capability of delivering
the ultimate Web experience. As of December 1998, we had approximately 35 million unique registrations for our registered services and have one of the

Web’s largest preferences databases to use in the targeted delivery of services
and merchant offers. Our traffic grew from an average of 65 million page views
per day in December 1997 to an average of 167 million page views per day in December 1998, again making Yahoo! one of the most highly trafficked sites
on the Web. Our 1998 net revenues nearly tripled to $203.3 million. In 1998,
we exhibited the leverage inherent to our business model and, on a pro forma
basis, grew our gross margin to 90 percent and our operating margin to 36
percent as a percentage of net revenues in the fourth quarter 1998. Our cash
and investments in marketable debt securities increased to $482 million at the
end of the year, compared to $108 million as of December 31, 1997. These results and our ability to anticipate the next level of growth have been possible because we’ve hired only the very best people and scaled them as we’ve grown our business. Our employees are passionate about delivering Web users the best possible experience, and they also understand the value of operating discipline and profitability.With strong gross margins, positive cash flow, and a healthy
balance sheet, we have positioned Yahoo! to aggressively and proactively grow
our worldwide business.
During the year, Yahoo! significantly enhanced and expanded the content, commerce, communication, and community services we offer our diverse users worldwide. At the end of 1998, we had 15 direct, branded versions of Yahoo! in operation outside the United States and we have since added three additional
sites in Asia, bringing the total to 18 world properties. People now use Yahoo!
in 12 languages from countries all around the world to access a wide array of
news, information, and services.We also now offer 13 registered services,
enabling Yahoo! members to personalize their Web experience.
This year, we aggressively expanded our efforts in online commerce, enabling
our users to find, connect with, buy, and ship what they are looking for, and

we are providing a powerful platform for sellers to reach Yahoo!’s millions of users. We unveiled a major new online shopping service, Yahoo! Shopping (http://shopping.yahoo.com), that leverages our June 1998 acquisition of Viaweb to provide consumers with an integrated shopping experience and deliver qualified buyers to merchants. Yahoo! Shopping, which featured more than 3,500 merchants and more than 3 million products in 1998, has received accolades
from buyers and sellers alike. Our offerings in commerce now also include
Yahoo! Auctions, Yahoo! Classifieds, Yahoo! Employment, Yahoo! Real Estate,
and Yahoo! Autos.
We also introduced a suite of Web solutions to address the needs of the growing number of small businesses and merchants conducting business online. Yahoo!
Small Business (http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com) is a comprehensive online
resource to help business professionals and entrepreneurs compete, including
dynamic news, content, and communities. Yahoo! now enables small businesses
to create, host, manage, and promote their online businesses. Yahoo! Connected Office (http://connected.clubs.yahoo.com/office) allows companies to create
their own internal communication hub and Intranet, including private communications tools.
As we expanded our comprehensive global branded network of Web properties
and grew our audience throughout the year, we expanded the extensive suite
of integrated marketing services we offer our growing set of advertisers and
merchant partners, and are well positioned as dollars spent on Web advertising
and electronic commerce grow. During the fourth quarter, we expanded
Yahoo!’s leading direct marketing services through our acquisition of Yoyodyne

Entertainment, Inc., a leader in Internet permission-based, direct marketing. Yoyodyne’s direct marketing services are now available as a component of Yahoo!’s extensive suite of advertising and merchant services, enabling us to offer our clients even greater options, including banner advertising, sponsorships, promotions, merchandising, placement and distribution, direct marketing
and member acquisitions, hosting, and transactions.
We further executed on our “Yahoo! Everywhere” strategy.We have remained open with regard to how users get their physical access to the Web and to what physical device they use, and have been aggressive in striking distribution relationships with a range of PC, access, and device providers to this end. In fact, already in the first quarter of 1999, we have entered significant distribution agreements with Gateway, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and Toshiba, making Yahoo!’s personalized services available on the desktop and/or keyboard of PCs worldwide. Our goal has always been to make Yahoo! available to users of any
device, from any access point, at any time.

what’s ahead?
You can expect 1999 to be another year of exciting developments.We are in a market that is big and getting bigger. The number of Internet users and the dollars spent on Web advertising and online commerce is projected to continue growing.We will continue to execute on our strategy to be the one place anyone needs to go to find and get connected to anything or anybody, on a global
basis, regardless of what device or access is used.
Since the founding of Yahoo!, we have been aggressive in partnering globally
with leading suppliers of technology, content, merchant services, and communication services. Over the past year and a half, we have also successfully
developed the process of acquiring and integrating other companies.We have acquired six companies in that time and have successfully integrated all of
them into Yahoo!. Developing this expertise has been a key internal goal and
one which should serve us well in aggressively growing our business in the
future of this highly competitive industry. During 1999, we plan to continue to
make acquisitions that make good strategic and financial sense.We also will
continue to invest in key international areas to leverage and extend our already strong position and increase share in those markets.
In online commerce and shopping, you can expect to see us extend aggressively
by broadening and deepening the range of consumer buying, transaction, and fulfillment services we provide across all major categories. You can also expect
us to broaden the full line of direct marketing services we already provide our advertisers and merchant partners.
With an enormous base of loyal users, Yahoo! is positioned to leverage the
power of the Internet and be one of the most important global, comprehensive, branded Web networks in the years ahead.We will continue to manage the
business carefully while fortifying the strong Web platform we’ve built over
the past four years.We are building a large business and strongly believe that
by putting our users first and delivering the best Web experience available, our
users, partners, employees, and shareholders will all benefit. The growth and
success of our business to date would not be possible without all of you, and I
want to thank you for your continued support.We look forward to the next year! Timothy Koogle
