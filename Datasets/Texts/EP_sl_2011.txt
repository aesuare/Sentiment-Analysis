El Paso Electric (the “Company” or “EE”) experienced a year filled with many successes, as well as some unique challenges. EE continued to fulfill its commitment to provide reliable electric service to the communities we serve while providing fair returns to our shareholders. Early in the year, the Company, along with much of the region, faced extreme winter weather that resulted in some disruptions of service for our customers. Notwithstanding, however, in 2011, EE was ranked the most reliable investor-owned utility in Texas for the year; ranking number one in both the System Average Interruption Duration Index (“SAIDI”) and the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (“SAIFI”). Since the extreme weather, we have invested in plant improvements designed to reduce the impact of severe cold weather in the future.
For the year, EE posted a total shareholder return of 28 percent, outperforming both the Dow Jones Industrial Index and the S&P 500 Utilities Index (both of which posted a 15 percent total shareholder return for 2011). Our stock price rose 26 percent during 2011, ending the year at $34.64 per share. We remain focused on our commitment to enhance long-term value for our shareholders while remaining steadfast in our mission to provide reliable service to our customers.
During 2011, the Company repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $86.5 million under its stock repurchase program. Since the inception of our stock buyback program in 1999, we have repurchased 25.4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $423.6 million, and our stock repurchases have averaged 3.8 percent of the outstanding shares each year. The Company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with common stock equity, representing 46 percent of total capitalization at December 31, 2011.
For the first time in 20 years, in 2011, EE began paying a quarterly cash dividend on common stock, distributing a total of $27.2 million in cash dividends. On January 26, 2012, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share payable on March 30, 2012. In the future, we expect that cash returns to shareholders will be primarily through cash dividend payments. Our Board announced a 2012 target dividend payout ratio of approximately 45 percent. The Board will review the Company’s dividend policy in conjunction with the annual shareholders meeting, which will be held on May 31, 2012.
We delivered solid financial results in 2011, with
earnings per basic share increasing almost 20 percent to $2.49 in 2011 from $2.08 per basic share before an extraordinary gain in 2010. Earnings were positively impacted by an expanding customer base and increased retail kWh sales. Much of the increase in retail kWh sales was the result of record-setting summer weather. Over the past five years, our retail kWh sales have grown at a compound annual rate of 2.35 percent, significantly exceeding the 0.41 percent five-year national industry average kWh sales growth rate. Much of this growth has been driven by growth in local economies, including the significant expansion of the military base at Fort Bliss. Currently, Fort Bliss has an active-duty soldier population of approximately 32,000 troops, and is the largest training military installation in the United States. Fort Bliss continues to construct new facilities and experience population growth, which is increasing the demand for housing in the area. At the current soldier population, approximately 15,700 total housing units are required in the off-base surrounding area for military personnel and their families.
Customer growth plus the record summer temperatures in 2011 drove EE’s native system peak demand to a record 1,711 MW on August 8, 2011, a 5.9 percent increase from the native system peak experienced in 2010. The continual growth in native system peak demand drives the need for new generation resources and the expansion of our transmission and distribution infrastructure. Accordingly, we are making a substantial investment in new plants to meet load growth and to modernize our power plant fleet by building new, more efficient natural gas units to replace aging units. Phase II of Newman Power Plant Unit 5 (“Newman 5”) (138 MW) began commercial operation on April 30, 2011, helping meet our customers’ growing demand for electricity in 2011. Newman 5 is a combined-cycle unit comprised of two gas-fired turbines and one steam turbine. The $235 million unit has a capacity of approximately 278 MW. When the unit operates in combined-cycle mode, it is our most efficient natural gas–fired generating unit. We anticipate spending $1.4 billion cash on the capital construction plan for 2012 through 2016, an average of approximately $278 million annually. This is in addition to the $901 million we spent on capital construction from 2007 through 2011. The plan includes $700 million for new generating capacity. The next new generating unit, Rio Grande Unit 9, has already received the requisite

certificate of convenience and necessity from both the Texas and New Mexico regulatory commissions and is now under construction. Rio Grande Unit 9 is an 87 MW aeroderivative gas turbine that will provide peaking capacity to our system and is expected to cost $82 million. Commercial operation is expected by May 2013 and because of its ability to start and achieve full load quickly, Rio Grande Unit 9 will provide needed flexibility to our generating capability.
As our need for generation is driven mostly by our growing peak demand, our construction plan calls for four additional gas-fired aeroderivative peaking units (87 MW each), with a cash construction cost of $360 million, to be placed in service by the end of 2016. In addition, our construction plan through 2016 includes $284 million for the initial construction phases of two combined-cycle units (292 MW each) to be placed in service in 2018 and 2019, and $18 million for anticipated renewable projects. The plan also includes $154 million of expenditures for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (“Palo Verde”), $401 million for transmission and distribution construction, and $172 million for other capital expenditures.
The Company maintains a strong balance sheet and credit ratings, which provide the financial wherewithal and flexibility to efficiently fund our operations and capital expenditures. At December 31, 2011, we had liquidity of $174 million, including $8 million of cash and the undrawn balance of our $200 million revolving-credit facility. The revolving-credit facility was refinanced during 2011 with an extended term and lower interest costs. In early 2012, we increased the size of our revolving-credit facility from $200 million to $300 million, and we anticipate issuing new long-term debt in 2012 to finance our current construction plan. During 2011, we maintained our investment-grade credit ratings with Standard & Poor’s reaffirming its BBB rating and stable outlook in September 2011, and Moody’s reaffirming its Baa2 rating and stable outlook in October 2011.
Since the beginning of 2011, EE has successfully executed its commitment to increase renewable energy within its service territory, completing more than 37 MW of solar-generation capacity, including both construction and contracts to purchase power. Recent projects completed include:
• A 5 MW photovoltaic facility owned by NextEra in Hatch, New Mexico, that began commercial operation on July 8, 2011,
• A 20 MW photovoltaic facility owned by NRG Energy in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, that began commercial operation on August 29, 2011,
• A 52 kW facility owned by EE, and built at its Wrangler Substation in East El Paso, that began commercial operation on October 28, 2011,
• A 12 MW photovoltaic facility owned by SunEdison in Las Cruces, New Mexico, that began commercial operation in March 2012, and
• A 37 kW photovoltaic rooftop facility located atop EE corporate headquarters that began commercial operation in January 2012.
An additional 10 MW photovoltaic facility owned by SunEdison in Chaparral, New Mexico, is expected to go into commercial operation in late April 2012.
In 2011, Palo Verde continued its record-setting operation by achieving its 20th consecutive year as the nation’s largest power producer. The almost 31.3 million megawatt-hours produced in 2011 is the most ever generated by Palo Verde or by any other U.S. power plant of any kind. According to industry data, Unit 3 produced more electricity than any other reactor in the U.S. in 2011 and was the second-most productive nuclear power station in the world. Despite a scheduled refueling outage in the spring of 2011, Unit 2 was the third-most productive reactor in the U.S. and ranked 10th in the world.
In addition, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved extending the operating licenses for all three Palo Verde units an additional 20 years beyond the original 40-year licenses, allowing Unit 1 to operate through 2045, Unit 2 to operate through 2046 and Unit 3 to operate through 2047. This approval came after a two-year in- depth technical audit, inspection and scrutiny of the plant’s operations, equipment and safety performance.
In October 2011, the El Paso City Council adopted a resolution requiring the Company to show cause as to why base rates for customers in El Paso should not be reduced. In addition, in November 2011, the El Paso City Council adopted a resolution that established current rates as temporary rates for customers of EE residing within the city limits of El Paso. The temporary rates will be effective from November 15, 2011, until the Public Utility Commission of Texas (“PUCT”) renders a final determination in the rate case. On February 1, 2012, EE filed a rate case with the PUCT, the City of El Paso, and other incorporated cities in Texas in response to the show-cause resolution. In its filing, EE requested a rate increase of $26.3 million, which
included an increase in base rates of $17.6 million and a surcharge of $8.7 million for rate-case expenses. A final order in the case is expected in the fall of 2012. Once rates are finalized, either the PUCT or the City of El Paso will authorize EE to surcharge bills for the amounts under-collected or may order a refund to customers for the amounts over-collected. A fair resolution of the rate case is one of EE’s key goals in 2012.
In 2011, our employees not only continued their commitment to serve the customers in our service territory with safe and reliable energy, but also through their volunteer efforts. More than 12,500 volunteer hours were documented by employees and more than $286,200 in donations were contributed to the United Way (making EE and its employees the largest contributor in El Paso and among the largest in Las Cruces).
In early 2012, David W. Stevens resigned as Chief Executive Officer of EE. We thank David for his valuable leadership of the Company during his three-year tenure and wish him well in his future endeavors. On January 31, 2012, the Board unanimously appointed Thomas V. Shockley III to assume the responsibilities of CEO on an interim basis. Mr. Shockley provides EE with strong and experienced leadership as the Board conducts its search for a permanent CEO. Mr. Shockley was Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of American Electric Power Company Inc. until his retirement in 2004, and he has served on our Board since May 2010. The search for a successor CEO is under way and both internal and external candidates will be considered.
In 2012, we remain focused on serving our customers and enhancing long-term shareholder value by working to operate and grow in the most efficient manner possible. Our significant ongoing investments in the construction of new, more efficient generation capacity, as well as enhancements to our distribution and transmission facilities, are a large part of achieving this goal. We will also work with our regulators and our customers toward obtaining a fair resolution in our Texas rate case.
We are proud of our operating and financial accomplishments in 2011. We thank our customers and our shareholders for their continued support and confidence as we serve our growing communities and provide value to our customers and shareholders.
