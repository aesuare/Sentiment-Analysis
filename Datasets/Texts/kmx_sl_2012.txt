Fiscal 2012 was a year of preparing and investing for growth, while maintaining an intense focus on building a better CarMax. We reached some major milestones, including achieving over $10 billion in revenues, selling more than 400,000 used vehicles at retail and posting record earnings. Our diversified business
Both our wholesale and finance operations delivered exceptional performance. Our wholesale auctions sold a record 316,000 vehicles, representing a 20% increase in unit sales, and achieved a 26% increase in gross profit. CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) delivered income growth of 19% and ended the year with total managed receivables of just under $5 billion.
We are excited to be growing again. After suspending store growth during fiscal 2009, and opening only 8 stores in
the last two fiscal years, we recently announced our plans to open 40 to 55 stores over the next four years. This includes 10 stores in fiscal 2013 and between 10 and 15 stores
in each of the following three years.
We look forward to the significant opportunity ahead of us. In addition to adding stores in new and existing markets,
we expect to continue to expand our market share as brand awareness and consumer loyalty grow. Despite being the largest retailer of used vehicles in the U.S., we estimate that our market share of the 0- to 6-year old vehicle market is still below 3% nationwide, and just 5% to 6% in those markets we currently serve.
We are committed to ongoing improvement in every part

the customer experience. We call it Building a Better CarMax and it means developing our associates, driving execution and discovering efficiencies that allow us to reduce waste throughout our organization.
DEVELOPING ASSOCIATES
Associate development has always been a fundamental element of CarMax’s success, and for the eighth consecu- tive year CarMax has been named by FORTUNE magazine as one of its “100 Best Companies to Work For.” We know that a concentration on development helps us attract and retain well-qualified employees and then challenges them to continue to grow. By creating a comfortable workplace environment where associates are inspired to do their best everyday and where they enjoy what they do, we know they will support our efforts to innovate and look for
new ways to enhance our customers’ experience.
For the fifth consecutive year, we were pleased to be named to TRAINING magazine’s Top 125, which recognizes companies that excel at associate development. During fiscal 2012, CarMax launched and expanded a number of important training and assessment initiatives. Professional Selling Principles, a key training program for CarMax, continues to
it has had a dramatic impact on the way we develop sales associates at CarMax. We have received excellent feedback from associates on how the skills they learn and practice help them connect better with customers and execute
more consistently.
Associates regularly log on to KMX University, our learning management program, to, among other things, launch online courses, register for classroom training and print self-paced training workshops. We also offer classes through CarMax’s College of Continuous Learning, where company leaders help facilitate classes that teach technical skills, competency development and business-specific concepts.
DRIVING EXECUTION
At CarMax, we are dedicated to offering world-class customer service. For our retail customers, a critical element of superior service is to provide a convenient and informed shopping experience. For most CarMax customers, this means visiting www.carmax.com. Every year we make significant steps forward in improving the usability and expanding the content on our website. As a result, we currently estimate that more than 70% of customers who buy a vehicle from us visit our website first and approximately 30% elect to transfer

We developed CarMax EasyShop to allow customers to com- plete more of the car-buying process online, before coming
to the store. This includes holding or transferring a vehicle, making an appointment, filling out necessary paperwork and applying for credit. We have already received positive feedback from customers in the test stores who have used some or
all of the CarMax EasyShop options, and during fiscal 2012, we expanded our test from two to eight stores in North Carolina and Tennessee. This initiative should not only enhance the experience of our customers and save them time in the stores, but it carries positive broader implications for store efficiency and associate engagement.
At our wholesale auctions, exceptional service means maintaining a 95% to 100% vehicle sales rate and making vehicle condition announcements. Dealers also appreciate our new and upgraded auction website, in place for the full fiscal year. The site offers enhanced functionality, greater transparency and ease of use, as well as more vehicle photos and inventory alerts.
In customer financing, great service starts with access to credit, and between CAF and our third-party lending providers,
we were at record levels in fiscal 2012. More than 85% of customers who applied for financing in our stores received at least one approval. If a customer chooses to finance through CAF, they can take advantage of our recently upgraded website, www.carmaxautofinance.com, where, among other things, we make it easy to view and update account informa- tion and set up automatic payments.
Listening to our customers and responding to their needs is
a driving force at CarMax and is behind the development of all our enhancements. Besides reaching out to customers and potential customers to build awareness and loyalty through Facebook, Twitter and other social media, we also track customer feedback from social media outlets as well as through traditional methods.
Our Customer Response Tracking System (CRTS) was designed to warehouse all forms of activity and feedback in a central- ized location so associates can easily learn about a customer’s complete history with CarMax. During fiscal 2012, CRTS improvements added a variety of new features that reduces the time necessary for the customer relations team and store management to research customer questions and issues and respond in a timely manner to their needs.
DISCOVERING EFFICIENCIES
Eliminating waste from our reconditioning processes has contributed to a year-over-year improvement in our gross profit per used vehicle sold in 12 of the last 13 quarters, while still preserving the competitiveness of our pricing. At the end of last year, we noted that our targeted efforts allowed us to achieve a cumulative reduction in average reconditioning costs of approximately $250 per vehicle, while still maintaining our high quality standards. While actual reconditioning costs will vary based on sales mix, these sustainable savings are now embedded in our cost structure.
Our operational excellence team is a driving force behind
our commitment to reduce waste and make ongoing process improvements. Since 2008, the team has led more than 850 associates in approximately 140 kaizen problem-solving events, which we expect will continue to generate significant savings. In addition, these events power our initiatives to strengthen our competitive position, enhance the customer experience and improve the daily work experience for our associates.
CARMAX CARES
The CarMax Foundation also achieved several milestones
this year, enabling it to support our communities more than ever before. During fiscal 2012, the Foundation’s annual grants totaled more than $2.4 million and grants since inception grew to $11.7 million. We created The CarMax Foundation in 2003 to enrich the communities where our associates live and work through grants funded from a portion of CarMax’s profits. The Foundation’s historic mission has been to support non-profit organizations that promote youth leadership, children, and family education and other organizations of importance to our associates.

In fiscal 2012, the Foundation added a new charitable focus area: non-profits devoted to wellness, nutrition and health awareness. CarMax offers a variety of wellness programs that encourage associates to make healthy choices and beneficial lifestyle changes; the Foundation is now expanding this focus on health to our communities.
Grants are awarded in a variety of ways, most significantly through CarMax’s Regional Giving Program, where each of our eight regions and CarMax Auto Finance choose where
to allocate funds in their local communities. This year the Foundation authorized additional funds under a new Com- munity Enrichment Program, which allowed the regions to recommend grants to highly visible non-profit organizations focused on cultural enrichment, including museums, libraries, gardens and others.
Associate giving programs include the Matching Gifts Program, which this year made two important enhancements: it was expanded to family members who volunteer time or make monetary donations, and it increased the per-associate matching gifts total. At 355 discrete events and an estimated 13,000 volunteer hours, fiscal 2012 was another record year for volunteer “team-builders” where associates join their colleagues in giving their time to charitable causes.
For CarMax, fiscal 2012 was a year of milestones and record accomplishments, as demonstrated in our overall financial results, our retail and wholesale vehicle sales, and at CAF and The CarMax Foundation. We again ended the year with a healthy bal- ance sheet and are well positioned for growth, in terms of liquid- ity, our real estate pipeline and our people. We look forward to doubling our store openings in fiscal 2013 to a total of ten, open- ing in some exciting new markets for CarMax, such as Denver, Colorado, and adding stores in some of our strong existing markets, such as Nashville, Tennessee. At the same time, we are committed to our ongoing priority of Building a Better CarMax.
Our associates are the key to our future. One of the primary reasons I am so proud to work at CarMax is because I believe we have the most dedicated and hard-working associates. They are the reason we can offer the best customer service and the highest quality vehicles. The success of our important initiatives is due entirely to their focus, creativity and skill.
I am very grateful to them for the work they do everyday.
I also remain grateful for the confidence and loyalty of our customers and shareholders. We have committed ourselves at CarMax to continually meeting your highest expectations.
