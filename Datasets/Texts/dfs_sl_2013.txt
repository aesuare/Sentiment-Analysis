David Nelms Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
   To Our Shareholders
The future is here—in more ways than one.
The dynamics of the retail banking and payments industries are rapidly evolving. The future is being shaped by new technology, changes in consumer behavior, the economy and regulation. In many ways, the “future”—including things like mobile banking, digital wallets and omni-channel commerce—is already here.
Big changes create big opportunities, and Discover is seizing those opportunities through a relentless focus on being the leading direct bank and payments partner. We made great progress in 2013, and we are redoubling our efforts in 2014.

 2013 Results
Our financial highlights included:
• Net income of $2.5 billion, or $4.96 per diluted share
• Return on equity of 24%
• Year-over-year loan growth of 5%
• Record low charge-off rate
• Network volume of $310 billion, including $110 billion from Discover card
“Discover is seizing opportunities through a relentless focus on being the leading direct bank and payments partner.”
• Strong expansion of merchant acceptance, domestically and around the world
• Repurchase of 5% of our outstanding common stock
In addition to strong financial performance, we achieved several important strategic accomplishments, including expanding our platform in direct banking through the launches of the Discover it card, Discover Cashback Checking and Discover Home Equity Loans; increasing our global footprint in payments through important new network-to-network agreements; and partnering with leading companies in emerging payments.
In addition, Discover was recognized by independent organizations for our leadership in customer service, brand loyalty, product innovation, data security and fraud prevention, workplace quality and corporate citizenship. We regard such awards and recognition
as indicators that we are delivering on our commitment to help people achieve brighter financial futures. We seek to do that through the products and services we offer and by making a difference in the communities in which we live and work.
In 2013, Discover employees volunteered 45,000 hours of time and, together with the company, donated millions of dollars to 1,600 non-profit organizations. In addition, we are now about halfway into the Pathway to Financial Success program—Discover’s five- year, $10-million commitment to bring financial education into America’s public high schools—and we are pleased with the positive impact of the program to date.
All in all, 2013 was an excellent year for your company—in terms of what we achieved for shareholders, for customers and for our communities.

 Growing in Credit Cards
Much of our success in 2013 was driven by our success in credit cards in the United States, where the Discover brand is known for rewards, service and value. Our new flagship Discover it card provides customers more choice, better service and added value through a unique set of benefits and an improved overall experience.
“Discover
is now a card company and more.”
I believe the Discover it card is the most innovative new credit card to be introduced by
the industry in years. We have reinvented our customer experience across all touch points, including application, card design, fulfillment and enhanced access to U.S.-based customer service representatives. We recently achieved another first for the industry by being the
first card issuer to automatically print free FICO® credit scores on our customer statements. Discover it has been well received by consumers and contributed significantly to year-over- year increases in our credit card applications and new accounts.
Discover cardmembers have access to our award-winning website, mobile apps and superior customer service, which contributes to industry-leading customer loyalty. We also continued to add value for customers through enhancements to our rewards programs, including new redemption options. One of Discover’s innovations is a platform that enables Discover cardmembers to use their Cashback Bonus or Miles rewards to pay for their purchases online at select merchants’ websites.

As a result of our continued strong focus on the customer and on execution, Discover again grew credit card loans faster than our peers in 2013. We also maintained above- industry profit margins, given our great credit and revenue results. Our expertise in credit risk management has enabled us to perform well compared to credit card industry averages over the past several years, and we are extending that expertise to other consumer loan products.
Expanding in Retail Banking
Discover is now a card company and more. Our expanded product line and new technology are enabling consumers to have the convenience and efficiency of online and mobile banking. Discover’s product line now includes personal loans, private student loans, mortgage originations and savings deposit products—and our new Cashback Checking and home equity loan products.
• Cashback Checking: Many banks have eliminated free checking and added fees. In contrast, our Cashback Checking product comes with valuable features like no monthly fees or minimum balance, plus 10 cents in Cashback Bonus when a customer writes a check, pays a bill online or uses a Discover debit card to make a purchase.

• Home equity loans: Equity in homes is growing again as home values increase, and we expect corresponding growth in demand for home equity loans. To serve that need, we offer a closed-end, fixed-rate product, positioned to help consumers leverage their home equity to achieve their financial goals.
Overall, I firmly believe that direct banking is the future of the consumer banking industry, and Discover is focused on delivering the full potential of direct banking to consumers.
Partnering in Payments
Our strategy in payments is to partner with other leading companies to deliver solutions that are relevant, high value and secure. Examples include:
• AribaPay: In 2013, Ariba and Discover announced a new service from Ariba that
is expected to transform B2B payments by eliminating paper transactions, providing better visibility into cash flow, and producing rich remittance information that improves reconciliation processes for buyers and sellers.
• PayPal: Also in 2013, we began implementation of our agreement to provide those of PayPal’s 60+ million active domestic account holders who elect to participate with access to millions of retail stores, restaurants, gas pumps and more.

 “Discover now has the third-largest global acceptance network.”
• Network-to-network alliances: Discover continued to sign alliances with other networks around the world, reaching new agreements in 2013 with regional networks in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
Our growth initiatives in payments are further bolstered by our expanding acceptance in the United States and around the world. Discover now has the third- largest global network*, with acceptance at more than 25 million merchant locations and
a network of more than 1 million ATMs.
We also faced some challenges in the payments marketplace last year. We invested to help realize the long-term potential of Diners Club in Europe by working with several franchises adversely affected by the European economy. Meanwhile, in the U.S. debit market,
new regulation resulted in new merchant routing capabilities, which led competitors to implement debit strategies that are creating challenges in retaining and growing profitable volume. We are moving aggressively to respond to the changing regulatory environment and to intense competitive pressure in debit.
Future Opportunities
Discover is approaching 2014 from a position of strength, with a unique set of assets and capabilities, including a great brand, a leadership position in rewards, superior customer service and strong credit risk management capabilities. Our loyal customer base is the foundation for growing credit card market share and for cross-selling additional direct banking products. We have also been rapidly establishing new alliances in our global payments business.
Our strengths are important because in both the retail banking and payments industries, new technology and innovations are leading to more choices, and our customers and business partners are making their choices based on added value. Consumers in retail banking are seeking convenience, service, ease-of-use, relevant real-time offers and enhanced security—all increasingly delivered in real time on interactive mobile devices. Our business partners in the payments industry are looking for added value in the form of new payment methods, integration between e-commerce and brick-and-mortar, rich data and stronger security.

2014 Priorities
Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on adding value for our customers and business partners. Your company has a record of solid financial results, a compelling set of assets, and a differentiated strategy in the retail banking and payments industries.
Direct banking is in its infancy, and I believe Discover is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the shift to direct banking—and to even drive the shift with innovative products and a better online and mobile customer experience. Owning our own network allows us to drive significant value to our cardmembers, and the accompanying signage at point of sale reinforces our branding.
Additionally, electronic payments are growing and evolving rapidly, so we are partnering with other companies inside and outside the financial services industry and other networks around the world to further leverage our global credit and debit networks.
Our priorities for 2014 are to achieve growth in Discover card loans, other direct consumer banking products, and global network volume and acceptance—all while maintaining
our very strong credit performance and while optimizing our funding, cost structure and capital position.
I am confident in our ability to succeed over the long term because Discover also has a dedicated and diverse group of employees, loyal customers, strong business partners and a talented Board of Directors. Together, we will seek to maximize the value of our company as we continue to help our customers achieve brighter financial futures.
