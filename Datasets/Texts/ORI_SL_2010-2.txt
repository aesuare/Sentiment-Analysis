2010: Annus Miserabilis IV
Damage from the Great Recession that began in 2007 abated in 2010, and Old Republic's operating bottom line was written with much less red ink. As the table below shows, losses in the mortgage guaranty segment--and lower profitability in general and title insurance--once again caused an operating loss. While mortgage guaranty posted lower operating losses because of a slowdown in overall claim costs, general insurance profitability was once again hampered by greater claim costs in the consumer credit indemnity line. A slight upward trend in title insurance operating results couldn't offset the weaknesses in the other two segments.

We have a steadfast commitment to--and a long record of--achieving consistent underwriting profitability. This has been derailed during the past four years. The reasons behind this situation come into sharp focus after a closer look at our operating results:

Fixing Old Republic's Underwriting Account
From a pure underwriting standpoint, we lost as much as 20.9 cents and as "little" as 1.5 cents of every premium dollar we earned in the last four years. Old Republic hasn't experienced such an extended period of underwriting difficulties since the mid-1980s to early 1990s. That period saw both a serious recession in housing finance and a cyclical downturn in general insurance. Our best guess is that the current underwriting malaise will last a while longer. Part of our general insurance business and all of our mortgage guaranty and title insurance lines depend on a healthy housing market and related financial transactions. Consequently, Old Republic's underwriting fortunes--particularly those associated with the mortgage guaranty line--are not likely to see much improvement until housing finance is redressed.  We will continue to use our time-tested approach to achieving underwriting profitability over cycles by focusing on these critical elements of insurance risk management:  ·   ·   ·  ·  Maintaining a pricing discipline and having the courage to walk away from risk   exposures that are mispriced or not sufficiently understood Aggregating diversified books of business targeted to industries and economic sectors that we know well Establishing reserves that sufficiently reflect our claim obligations Allocating our shareholders' capital to the parts of our business most likely to produce above-average and reasonably stable total returns

General Insurance Affected by Difficulties in CCI
Old Republic's general insurance business has long been its anchor to consolidated underwriting stability. The segment's composite underwriting ratio--the relationship of claims and other costs as a percentage of earned premiums--has bested published industry averages in most years. Since 2007, however, long-term underwriting profitability has been dented by very unsatisfactory results in the consumer credit indemnity line (CCI), a special business

niche we developed in the 1950s. In recent times the coverage had evolved gradually from its original focus on low value home improvement loans to much larger home equity-based consumer borrowings. As a result, CCI assumed many of the same risk characteristics as the mortgage guaranty business. Since 2007 CCI claim costs have also risen to heights never before experienced. The following table shows the effect that CCI premiums and claim costs have had on general insurance underwriting performance.

 Currently, our CCI line is in temporary run-off. Going forward, new production will be considered on the basis of revised terms of trade. The remaining and much greater portion of Old Republic's general insurance business has continued to perform exceedingly well. A soft pricing environment and recessionary conditions have, however, constrained premium growth during the past several years. Lower economic activity affects such factors as sales and employment levels, both of which are important elements upon which Old Republic's insurance premiums are based.  Net investment income in this segment has been relatively flat in recent years. The lower yields offered by new fixed maturity investments continue to provide paltry returns. As in our other segments, we've maintained a relatively short maturity portfolio in anticipation of receiving greater reinvestment yields in the future.  Late in 2010, as part of our continuing business recalibration initiatives, we added meaningful depth to our general insurance business. This was achieved by acquiring PMA Capital Corporation, a venerable institution with a strong business base in select industries to which it sells liability insurance coverages and services. In recent years PMA's net premium and fee revenues averaged approximately $450 million. We expect this business base to grow, as it benefits from the greater financial and other resources that Old Republic can provide.

Mortgage Guaranty Reduces its Loss
Mortgage guaranty operating performance continued to improve in 2010. Apart from the positive impact of certain captive reinsurance commutations and pool terminations, the latest year's performance reflected lower claim costs and firm management of operating expenses.

 Earned premiums continued to decline during 2010. The lower volume stemmed from a drop in new insurance, higher premium refunds related to claim rescissions, and the termination of pool insurance contracts mentioned earlier. Moreover, new business volume reflected continued weakness from the downturn in overall mortgage originations, lower industry-wide penetration of the nation's current mortgage market, and the continuing effects of more selective underwriting guidelines we've had in place since late 2007.  Net investment income declined because of a lower invested asset base brought about by higher claim disbursements, lower premium volume, the termination of insured mortgage pools, and a lower yield environment for quality securities in our investment portfolio.  2010 recurring claim costs were significantly lower compared with 2009. This resulted mostly from downward trends in newly reported and outstanding traditional primary loan delinquencies. Historically high, though gradually declining levels of claim rescissions and denials also affected the trend. Production and operating expense ratios for all periods reported upon reflect moderate benefits from expense management. This positive effect, however, was largely offset by continued declines in net premiums earned.

A Closer Look at the Mortgage Insurance Industry
The ongoing tribulations we and other mortgage insurance (MI) providers are facing have revealed important matters of enterprise risk management requiring timely resolution. The existing MI business model is exposed to two types of claim occurrences: 1) frequently or normally occurring annual claim costs, and 2) infrequent and largely unpredictable annual or multiyear claim aggregations that are much greater than normal. The recent and ongoing meltdown in housing values and Great Depression eralike increases in mortgage loan defaults and foreclosures have resulted in unprecedented and substantial losses for the private MI industry. Based on publicly available data for 2007 to 2009, and assuming that the current catastrophic period will extend through 2012, it is possible that the industry's overall claim ratio could range between 170% and 180% for the six years combined. Charged with these claim levels, MI companies will have lost anywhere between 70% and 75% of the regulatory capital

Old Republic's significant decline in earnings since 2007 is related to the downturn in housing and mortgage lending sectors of the American economy.

they had in place at year-end 2006--before the onset of the current catastrophe.  GAAP accounting methodology has an "annual" orientation. When applied to the MI industry, financial accounting does not consider both the normal and the long-term catastrophic claim exposures in current accounts. To the best of our knowledge, industry-wide enterprise risk management practices do not address the coverage's embedded long-term catastrophic exposures. The state insurance regulatory environment in place since the advent of the modern mortgage guaranty industry provides for a long-term claim contingency reserve. However, this provision is overridden by the GAAP accounting used in shareholders' reports. So the resulting financial reporting scenario appears as a tale of riches to rags. In good years, when relatively low claim ratios amplify GAAP bottom lines, MI insurers enjoy the star status of companies that deliver growing earnings and large returns on equity, and become avid stock buy-back practitioners. In time, a catastrophic period hits and past profitability comes to be seen as something ephemeral: capital accounts are emptied of their succor, longterm shareholders are left hanging, and MI companies come seeking new capital to live yet another day.  Mortgage insurance is vital to the American dream of home ownership. There will always be a need for well-structured and capitalized corporate facilities that make home ownership affordable for people who lack a sufficient down payment, but are honorably bound to their obligations. There is a continuing place for Old Republic in this market. So we intend to do our part to engage the MI, investor, and regulatory communities to the view that long-range catastrophic exposures need to be addressed in more realistic and responsible ways. We think this can be fairly done through a newly tailored, industry-wide reinsurance program of long duration, and/or additional state insurance regulatory constraints.

Old Republic's title insurance business continued to reflect the more positive operating momentum that first emerged in the second quarter of last year. 2010 growth in premiums and fees benefited from market share gains from title industry dislocations and consolidation.

to the year's revenue stream. Claim ratios were relatively stable, even though we continued to make moderate additions to reserve levels in consideration of evolving claim emergence trends. Production and general operating expenses reflected the greater costs associated with much higher premium and fee levels, and the inclusion of expenses from the Florida venture. A higher invested asset base generated moderate investment income growth in 2010 as a whole, even though market yields have been lower for the high-quality securities in the investment portfolio.

Managing Capital Efficiency and Risk
The risk profile of our business will evolve as we aim to achieve greater earnings stability and capital efficiency. The recent PMA acquisition puts more capital at risk in areas that are less prone to catastrophic exposures and more adaptive to quicker pricing and underwriting standard corrections. The following table shows the impact on our capital allocations of the recent segmented results of our business, of the steps taken in these regards, and of our objectives in managing capital for the long run.

Dividend Increases
While Old Republic's consolidated operating income was written with red ink for the third year in a row, we had enough accumulated earnings in reserve and capital flexibility to pay a slightly higher cash dividend to our shareholders. 2010 marked the 29th consecutive year of cash dividend increases. We've always viewed a regular and growing cash return as an important and concrete element for delivering a reasonable total return to long-term shareholders.  The table below shows the factors in the annual changes in the shareholders' account in total and on a per-share basis. In the past two years, continued gains from sales of securities and improvements in their market value have more than offset the cash dividends payments.

Continued Financial Strength
Old Republic's consolidated balance sheet retained its pristine state during 2010. It was devoid of poor quality, illiquid, and non-transparent investment securities. Intangible assets, such as goodwill, were negligible in comparison with total assets and shareholders' equity. Previously established consolidated claim reserves once again produced a moderate redundancy so did not penalize last year's operating results.  The shareholders' account grew by nearly 6% in 2010 to $4.12 billion. Most of the increase arose from the additional shares issued for the PMA acquisition. Total capitalization--which represents the combination of debt and common shareholders' equity-- amounted to almost $4.6 billion compared to $4.2 billion for 2009. At 11.5% of equity at the close of 2010, our debt level and structure remained reasonably flexible and manageable.

Higher Market Valuation of Old Republic Stock
The market value of Old Republic's common shares at the end of the year was nearly 36% higher than its closing price for 2009. Last year's market value gain reversed three consecutive annual declines.  The shares' total market return--the sum of the year-to-year percentage change for the closing price, and the cash dividend as a percentage of the preceding year-end closing price--came to 42.7% in 2010 versus a negative 10.1% in 2009. Total return on a book value basis--the sum of the annual post-tax change in shareholders' equity per share and the pretax dividend yield on that account's beginning of year value--was 2.2% in 2010 versus 7.9% in 2009. In each case, Old Republic's consistent cash dividend policy made a substantial difference. For the most recent decade, total market and book returns, with re-invested dividends, averaged 4.2% and 8.5%, respectively, while the S&P ten year average produced a 3.6% total return.

Business Outlook is Unclear
The intermediate term outlook for our business remains relatively clouded. Critical elements of the nation's economy are not expected to mend very quickly. Of most significance to Old Republic's interests are ongoing weaknesses in employment levels, consumer credit extensions, and the housing market generally. The combination of all these factors is not positive for much of our business. Absent quicker repair and renewal, they may well delay a return to strong profitability until late 2012 or even 2013 ... or so we think at the moment.  As a participant in many segments of a cyclical industry, we are accustomed to the vagaries of its booms and busts. That's why we manage the business for the long run. We keep a firm grasp on the steering wheel and stay nimble. We protect the capital resources entrusted to us, and we retain good people whose intellectual capital and shared values enable us to be a continuing force for the good of many. Even though our delivery of better than average returns is being delayed, we can and will manage to better outcomes for all of our stakeholders.
