 To Our Shareholders:
As Aon celebrates its 25th year as a global brand, I am pleased to report to you that our firm finished 2011 with another solid performance, reflecting continued momentum in our Risk Solutions and HR Solutions businesses as we deliver value to clients around two of the most important issues facing the global economy: risk and people.
This success is the result of the dedicated and tireless work of our over 60,000 colleagues around the world who are committed to providing distinctive value to our clients every day.
I want to thank our shareholders for voting overwhelmingly to approve the board’s decision to move our corporate headquarters to the United Kingdom. This move will provide greater access to emerging markets and allow Aon to take better advantage of the strategic proximity to Lloyd’s and the London market.
This move will also have several near- and long-term financial benefits, including increased financial flexibility and improved capital allocation. As the proportion of Aon’s revenue from international operations continues to grow, the ability to allocate capital for investment and growth will be even more vital to the firm’s ongoing success.
Overall, in 2011 we accomplished a number of goals against our three strategic objectives: provide distinctive value to our clients, attract and retain unmatched talent, and deliver operational excellence.
Our most significant accomplishments for 2011 included the following:
• We continued to strengthen our industry-leading position as the #1 intermediary of primary risk insurance, the #1 intermediary of reinsurance, and the #1 human resource consulting and outsourcing firm with unmatched talent and capabilities
• We achieved improved organic revenue growth across both of our businesses in a year when macro-economic and industry pressures continue to be felt in many markets around the globe
• We achieved an estimated $233 million of cumulative restructuring and synergy savings under the Aon Hewitt restructuring program and are fully on track to achieve $355 million of cumulative restructuring and synergy savings in 2013
• We delivered 21% growth in net income per share attributable to Aon shareholders
• Lastly, we increased cash flow from operations 30% to over $1 billion, enabling the return of more than $1 billon of excess capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program and payment of dividends on common stock
Aon is in a unique leadership position. Our solid operational performance, combined with strong expense discipline and cash flow generation, provides us with the opportunity to make significant investments in our colleagues and in our capabilities in order to create value for our shareholders. We will continue to strengthen our leadership position in the marketplace and build on our industry-leading capabilities to identify and capture growth opportunities across all of our markets.
In Risk Solutions,
• We are investing in client leadership to drive greater productivity and efficiency with the roll-out of the Revenue Engine in EMEA and Asia Pacific, as well as the roll out of Client Promise, which is driving greater retention and rollover rates across our client base

• We continue to invest in innovative technology such as FAConnect and our Global Risk Insight Platform, which is the world’s leading global repository of risk and insurance placement information
• We are driving our Aon Broking initiative to better match client needs with insurer appetite for risk, resulting in better economics for all participants
• We continued to invest in the future of our firm as well as expand our international footprint through acquisitions such as Glenrand MIB in South Africa
• And finally, effective January 1, 2012, we aligned our global health and benefits platform under Risk Solutions to better leverage a broader global distribution channel and to strengthen the deep brokerage capabilities in data and analytics with clients and insurance carriers
As we have discussed previously, we have ‘‘proved the concept’’ of these investments in 2011, and as we move into 2012 and 2013, we will continue to drive greater scale and increase operating leverage as a result of these investments in our Risk Solutions segment.
In HR Solutions,
• We are expanding our international footprint as the workforce is increasingly becoming more global, with investments in key talent and capabilities across emerging markets
• We are continuing to invest in expanding our core HR BPO offerings through point solutions opportunities such as dependent eligibility audits and absence management diagnostics
• We are expanding our industry-leading benefits administration platform from large-market to middle-market
• Finally, we continue to strengthen our industry-leading position in health care exchanges, enabling clients to prepare for ultimate changes in health care legislation with design, purchasing and administration capability
Whether it is an earthquake and tsunami in Japan or floods in Australia and New Zealand, our colleagues were on the ground in a rapid response mode, helping clients and fellow colleagues deal with the business and personal aspects of these catastrophic events. As we survey the globe, it is clear that the magnitude, scope and complexity of risk continues to increase, both in terms of traditional risk such as property, casualty or directors and officers’ liability, and non-traditional risk such as terrorism and pandemic.
On the people side, health care reform is a growing issue for U.S. companies in need of advice and solutions to manage the complex legislative changes ahead. In 2011, we identified the unique opportunity to invest in health care exchanges; just one example of the many differentiating solutions we are able to provide to our clients.
While the global economy appears to be making some improvement, many of our clients are still facing strong economic headwinds. Fortunately, Aon has tremendous capability and unmatched resources to support them in these times. The strength of our global network and our demonstrated ability to deliver worldwide capability on a truly local level makes Aon better equipped than anyone else to serve the needs of our clients.
Our portfolio of Risk Solutions and HR Solutions gives us the financial strength and flexibility to invest in our businesses, and in our clients and colleagues, specifically in critical areas such as training, technology, talent and brand. For example, Aon Benfield invests approximately $100 million each year in analytic capability which helps to deliver distinctive value to clients.
It is continued investments such as these that will strengthen our ability to better serve our clients, provide greater opportunities for colleagues, and increase value for shareholders. These investments are being made within the context of our ongoing margin improvements. As we add to our global network and build upon our capabilities, we are identifying and eliminating efficiencies and costs from

non-client facing areas. These actions allow us to make continued and significant investments in our business and in our people while simultaneously delivering margin improvement.
Looking forward, the next five years at Aon will be key to how we position our firm for growth for the next 50 years. I truly believe that Aon has the unique capability in terms of resources and people to remain as the leader in risk management and human resource consulting and outsourcing for the long-term.
This is an exciting time to be part of Aon. It is a pleasure for me to be part of the leadership team that is working hard on your behalf, and I hope you share my confidence in the view that continued success lies ahead for Aon in 2012 and beyond.
Lastly, on a personal note, I want to thank Jan Kalff, Eden Martin, Andrew McKenna and John Rogers for their many years of distinguished service as members of Aon’s Board of Directors. Their collective wisdom and insight has allowed Aon to evolve into the preeminent global professional services firm that it has become today, and we will miss their sage counsel as we continue on our path of progress and momentum.
Thank you for the faith and trust you have placed in our Board of Directors and management team. Your support is invaluable to our efforts, and we will work hard to exceed your expectations.
