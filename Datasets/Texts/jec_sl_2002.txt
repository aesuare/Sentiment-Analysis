SHAREHOLDERS MESSAGE
This fiscal year began with great uncertainty, and there was no improvement during the course of the year either economically or politically. Nevertheless, we registered record revenues of $4.6 billion and record net income of $109.7 million ($1.98 per diluted share), an increase of 25 percent over 2001, or 17 percent when adjusted for the change in goodwill accounting. Cash flow was strong during the year. We began the year with debt of $184.0 million, added $47.5 million with the McDermott acquisition, and ended the year with $91.7 million in debt. We accomplished this through a strong earnings stream and strict control of capital expenditure.
STRATEGIC GROWTH
In 2001, we acquired a portion of the LawGIBB group and completed the acquisition of Stork’s engineering and contracting business. Early in 2002, we established a strong Canadian presence by adding the Delta operations of McDermott Engineers and Constructors in Calgary. After three significant acquisitions in a twelve-month period, we focused on consolidation, integration, and debt reduction.
Through successful acquisitions and internal growth, we expanded our share in many markets and increased our backlog from $5.9 billion to $6.7 billion. We’ve integrated GIBB, Stork, and Delta; we now expect to take on appropriate acquisitions as they become available.
Our History of Consistent Net Earnings Growth
Buildings, Infrastructure, Federal Programs, and Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology were quite active in 2002 and should remain so in 2003. The Refining projects focused on addressing environmental regulations and clean gasoline programs, many of which enter the construction phase in 2003. Low sulfur diesel is just beginning, and regulations for aviation and off-road diesel are yet to come. All this points to a healthy Refining business for the years ahead.
Public spending in Western Europe and the U.S. kept the Buildings and Infrastructure markets strong, although declining government revenues stifled some spending at the local level.
Our U.S. federal business is very good and should continue to grow. Our Department of Defense business has expanded significantly over the past couple of years and that trend should continue. The Department of Transportation, Department of Energy, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration are significant clients for us that remain strong.
The Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology market remains robust. Manufacturers require new facilities to develop drugs at a record pace and to address stricter Food & Drug Administration requirements.
Conversely, the Chemical business remains at the bottom of its cycle. While some chemicals showed signs of life this year, we believe the market won’t rebound until late 2003 or early 2004. The Pulp & Paper business is also flat, although it too could improve during 2003 and 2004. The Technology market remains weak, with limited activity in semiconductors. On the bright side, our work in high-technology energy science facilities is growing.

MARKET CLIMATE
In spite of the struggling Western and Asian economies, we achieved record sales in 2002 and our prospect list is strong. Specifically, Refining,
 
                                        DELIGHTED CLIENTS
We spend a lot of time with project teams discussing the importance of total client satisfaction and how to increase client delight. Client satisfaction survey results show that our effort to deliver superior performance is working, with an improvement of more than two full percentage points on our average score. Client delight is a long journey and we won’t be satisfied until our average survey scores are above 90 percent, with zero dissatisfied clients.

management procedures so everybody clearly understands their roles and responsibilities. In the end, we are responsible for subcontractor safety—our clients expect this from us. Our commitment to safety never ends and we intend to set the pace for our industry. Our goal is zero incidents; we won’t be satisfied until we achieve it.
 “Our entire organization is very pleased that Jacobs carried out the two recent outages in plant 5 without a single incident or reported first aid. This is a remarkable achievement on our Journey to Zero. We recognize all employees and the efforts of management and front-line foremen; and supervision, coordination, and safety people. On the behalf of Suncor, please accept my thanks for this achievement.”

SAFETY
Our safety performance leveled off last year with stagnation in some of our existing operations and the integration of three major acquisitions into our safety program. Although our OSHA incident rate (U.S. Standard) remained below 1.0, we didn’t achieve the improvement we targeted. At mid-year we significantly retooled our subcontract safety
THE FUTURE
As we write this, a sluggish global economy and significant threat of war create great uncertainty in the business world. However, we view this as a great opportunity to gain market share, explore intelligent acquisitions, and continue to grow our business an average of 15 percent annually. Our prospect list remains strong and, as always, we appreciate the support of our employees, clients, and shareholders. With this type of support, we can accomplish anything.
