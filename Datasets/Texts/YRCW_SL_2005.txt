Dear Shareholder,
2005 was another year of solid progress on
our journey as a global transportation services
company. We delivered our second consecutive
record year of revenue and earnings while
advancing our strategic position with the
acquisition of the
USF
companies and the
establishment of two joint ventures in China.
Cost reduction synergies of an additional
$100 million contributed significantly
to improving our margins and provided a
stronger competitive position in 2005.
We are now the third-largest ground
transportation company in the country.
Each
of our operating companies improved
their year-over-year performance substantially and received great support from
YRC
Worldwide Enterprise Services,
YRC
Worldwide Technologies and the
corporate team. As is the case every year,
it’s the people in our company who make us
successful, and they deserve the appreciation
and credit for our accomplishments.
In 2005,
those accomplishments includedthe acquisition of USF.
By adding the
USF
companies to our portfolio, we gained
immediate and nationwide scale in the next-day
and regional markets, which are among the
fastest-growing transportation segments.
Our international expansion focused on finding the right partner in China—and we
found that partner in Jin Jiang Investment.
Our objective is to provide seamless,
end-to-end global transportation solutions
to our customers.
The joint ventures with
Jin Jiang advance this by greatly expanding
our scale and capabilities in China.
As we enter 2006, our corporate journey
continues under a new name—
YRC
Worldwide,a name that better reflects the
breadth and depth of the company, and
emphasizes the global nature of our business.
Our nearly 70,000 employees operate in
more
than 70 countries around the world,
and our services include logistics as well as
global,
national and regional transportation. The name “YRC Worldwide” speaks to the
reality of what our enterprise is today.
The success of our enterprise and our efforts
is measured in many ways. For the fourth
consecutive year, we have been ranked
Number One in our industry on the annual
FORTUNE
®
magazine list of America’s Most
Admired Companies. In this respected survey,
YRC
Worldwide ranked number one in all
eight of the categories measured: innovation,
employee talent, use of corporate assets,
social responsibility, quality of management,
financial soundness,long-term investment
and quality of our services.
As we approach
$10 billion in revenue, we
have new opportunities to expand capabilities,
establish a significant business in Asia,reduce
our cost base and build additional shareholder
value. Our focus is on delivering another
record performance in 2006.
While our name is new, our strategy is not.
Our journey continues as
YRC
Worldwide
evolves as a global transportation leader,
with great people, strong brands and a
vibrant future.
