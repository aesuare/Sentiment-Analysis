Innovations and product line expansions such as the T-Class proved key to spurring sales growth and garnering industry accolades—including our Comfort Sensor, which combines relative humidity and carbon dioxide sensor options to regulate temperature and maximize indoor comfort. Along with our popu- lar Humiditrol® dehumidification system, the Comfort Sensor won the 2006 Innovation Award at the AHR Expo, the world’s largest HVAC trade show. Our S-ClassTM 35-50 ton rooftop line was selected by a panel of independent contractors for the Gold Dealer Design Award from Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration News. And Buildings magazine picked our L Connection® Network as its Editor’s Choice.
To support continued growth in our Commercial Heating & Cooling business, we initiated a 250,000-square-foot expansion of our manufacturing facility in Arkansas. This plant is arguably the most flexible and responsive commercial rooftop factory in the industry, providing customers with the shortest configure- to-order lead times.
In Europe, higher sales volumes and a favorable product mix contributed to improved profitability. To sustain this improvement, we are increasing our focus on our core rooftop product lines and implementing lean manufacturing initiatives similar to those we have executed so well in the United States.

Effective internal programs resulted in efficiency gains and cost reductions. Our safety improvement program resulted in meaningful decreases in both the cost and the incidence of worker compensation and auto claims. And through our Inventory Management and Replenishment program, combined with increased focus on accounts receivable, working capital was reduced to less than 8% of sales.
Earning consumer trust through trained, dependable service technicians is key to success in the home comfort business. Our emphasis on technician certification through North American Technical Excellence (NATE), a respected third-party certification organization, has resulted in certifying 85% of our service technicians to date—one of whom won the national title in NATE’s seventh annual Certified Technician competition. Building the largest NATE- certified workforce in the industry, we turned our attention to productivity with the initiation of Project FAST (Field Automation for Service Technicians). This project, which will be rolled out over the next two years, will deploy mobile wireless communications technology to improve the efficiency and the effectiveness of our technicians in the field.
Expert leadership at the service center level is important to the profitable man- agement of our operations and to quickly identify and take advantage of local growth opportunities. We continue to develop the best emerging leadership talent, graduating 18 new service center general managers (GMs) through our GM Fast Track development program in 2006.

emphasis on product innovation. We are focusing technology experts on our customers’ most urgent needs, targeting half of new product ideas from outside our company. Our ice slurry system, developed in Europe, is an innovative and environmentally friendly approach to refrigeration that generates ice during off-peak demand hours for use in cooling. Supermarket installations of this system have confirmed energy savings of 30%, with a 75% reduction in refrigerant charge. And our recently introduced Smart Defrost KitTM can save our customers up to 40% on energy costs by reducing the number of defrost cycles required by low-temperature refrigeration systems. It is the only solution of its kind—providing tremendous potential in an untapped global retrofit market.
Expanding our worldwide influence, we intend to explore acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances to enhance our capabilities and extend our product reach into segments related to the core commercial refrigeration systems market we serve. We will grow responsibly, maintaining and strength- ening our commitment to be a steward of the global environment.

     “It is the opportunities for continued growth that are energizing us now—and we are ready to take full advantage, thanks to our strong performance, solid strategic direction, and the right leadership.”
Growing through solid strategic direction
We are executing our plans for future growth and profit improvement through carefully planned strategies, involving both organic growth and acquisitions. Our strong balance sheet provides the flexibility to pursue acquisitions, and our leadership and management depth are fully capable of integrating new businesses smoothly into our operations. But while acquisitions provide opportunity for LII, they are not imperative for us to improve our profitability. We are committed to using the strength in our balance sheet responsibly, with a carefully considered process to ensure acquisitions are a good fit with our business and consistent with our growth strategy.
Growing through leadership
Although our numbers and achievements are notable, it would be impossible to consider a growth strategy without the right leadership and business mix. We have “cleared the decks” over the past few years to focus on the four profit- able business segments that make up our company today. Just as important, we are confident in the leadership team we have put in place. Our senior exec- utive staff has deep and proven experience and the strong management teams they have assembled to help run our businesses reflect the depth of talent in our organization.
We are fortunate to be in the position to build on the leadership of our previ- ous chairman, John Norris, Jr., who retired last year after 46 years of service to LII and the HVACR industry. During that time, including his past 15 years as chairman of LII, we grew from a largely domestic business of $50 million to an international corporation with well over $3 billion in sales. We thank John for his strong and visionary leadership, which benefited not only our company but also the entire industry.
While we can reflect positively on what we accomplished last year, our sights are now set on 2007 and beyond. Of course, our confidence in what is to come would certainly not be possible without our 16,000 employees worldwide. Their innova- tive ideas and hard work fuel our commitment to grow a stronger future for our company and our shareholders. With their continued energy and drive, it’s easy to be excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
