   To Our Shareholders
    Fiscal 2009 was clearly a tumultuous time in both the global and domestic economies and in the full-service dining industry. As difficult as the year’s developments were, we believe they confirm that Darden is on the right strategic path. In the Q&A that follows, we outline why that’s the case and how – despite the challenges – we continued to invest in our Company’s future. We’re especially proud that, as we invested for our long-term success, Darden was also able to deliver financial results from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 that once again outpaced the industry.
• Sales from continuing operations increased
8.9 percent to $7.22 billion for fiscal 2009, which reflects inclusion of LongHorn Steakhouse and The Capital Grille for the full year, as well as new restaurant growth at each brand, the effect of an additional operating week in fiscal 2009 and same-restaurant sales growth at Olive Garden.
• Net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 were $371.8 million, a 0.6 percent increase from the $369.5 million earned in fiscal 2008. Diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal 2009 were $2.65, a 3.9 percent increase from the $2.55 earned in fiscal 2008. Acquisition and integration costs and purchase accounting adjustments related to the October 2007 acquisition of RARE Hospitality (RARE) reduced diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately 10 and 19 cents in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively.
• Excluding acquisition and integration costs and purchase accounting adjustments related to the RARE acquisition, diluted net earnings per share
from continuing operations were $2.75 in fiscal 2009, an increase of 0.4 percent compared to the $2.74 earned in fiscal 2008 on the same basis. The additional operating week in fiscal 2009 contributed approximately six cents of diluted net earnings per share for the year.
• In fiscal 2009, net earnings from discontinued operations were $0.4 million, and diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations were $0.00, related primarily to Smokey Bones Barbeque & Grill, which was sold in January 2008. This compares to net earnings and diluted net earnings per share from discontinued operations of $7.7 million and $0.05, respectively, in fiscal 2008. When results from discon- tinued and continuing operations are combined, our diluted net earnings per share were $2.65 and $2.60 in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively.
• Combined U.S. same-restaurant sales for Olive Garden, Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse declined 1.4 percent in fiscal 2009, which reflects the year’s challenging operating environment. This is, however, more than four percentage points favorable to the
5.6 percent decline for the Knapp-TrackTM benchmark of U.S. same-restaurant sales excluding Darden. U.S. same- restaurant sales increased 0.3 percent at Olive Garden and decreased 2.2 percent and 5.6 percent at Red Lobster and LongHorn Steakhouse, respectively.
• We continued the buyback of Darden common stock in fiscal 2009, spending $144.9 million to repurchase 5.1 million shares. Since beginning our share repurchase program in 1995, we have repurchased approximately 152 million shares of our common stock for more than $2.9 billion.

How would you describe fiscal 009?
In many respects, fiscal 2009 was Darden’s finest year. Despite some of the most challenging times we’ve seen in decades in both our economy and our industry, our financial performance compared quite favorably to our industry peers and to most other companies that touch consumers. We were able to adjust to deteriorating conditions very quickly, aggressively managing our costs and driving to our restaurants a disproportionate share of the traffic that was available in an appreciably diminished marketplace. And, we did this while protecting our people, our profitability and the long-term health of our brands and our business model.
Darden’s performance in 2009 confirms that the Company is well positioned to succeed in difficult times. More importantly, because we were able to deliver strong financial results while continuing to invest in our long-term future, we are confident Darden will emerge from today’s weakened environment as a stronger company that is capable of even wider positive gaps to industry benchmarks for both sales and earnings.
What is the vision for Darden’s future?
We’re on a path to create what we believe is a truly great company; a vibrant organization that consistently produces competitively strong financial results and is a special place to work for employees. Our vision is to be a company that positively affects meaningfully more guests, employees, communities and business partners – a company that matters even more than we do today.
This vision reflects two things: first, we are fortunate to be in an industry that, while already large, offers significant opportunity for growth; and second, we bring a potent combination of strengths to bear as we pursue that opportunity. We have a portfolio of proven brands that collectively have a very strong long-term sales and earnings growth profile. We have scale and all the advantages that scale brings, and we’re continuing to make changes in how we work so our scale works even harder for us. Changes that, during this past fiscal year, helped us limit earnings erosion as sales softened. Finally, we have outstanding teams in our restaurants and our restaurant support center who have tremendous expertise and skill individually and collectively, and who are highly engaged.
