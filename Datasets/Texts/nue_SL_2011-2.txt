Fellow Stockholders:
The board of directors would like to recognize the strong performance of the entire Nucor team in what continues to be the greatest challenge the steel industry has experienced since the Great Depression.
One of the critical components of Nucor’s success is the ongoing commitment, regardless of circumstance, to invest in projects that support continued long-term growth. Dan has outlined a number of examples in his letter.
Despite the extended period of economic distress, as part of Nucor’s commitment to shareholders, at the end of 2011 the board approved an increase in the company’s base dividend to $0.365 per share. In 2011, each share of Nucor stock paid more than 750% higher dividends than it did a decade earlier.
Nucor teammates help protect the company by protecting themselves. Throughout the year, they continued to make safety their top priority. In addition, Nucor continues to develop the talent of its exceptional group of teammates. As Nucor has grown, the Company has presented additional opportunities for its people to build and develop their leadership skills. Each December, the board reviews the process of hiring, leadership development and succession planning. With the retirement of several top
executives in recent years, a new generation of leadership has stepped confidently and ably into place.
It’s always nice when others recognize the quality of Nucor’s leadership. IndustryWeek inducted Dan DiMicco into the respected magazine’s Manufacturing Hall of Fame. The magazine described Dan as “a leading voice for U.S. manufacturing and the nation’s steel industry” and acknowledged his commitment to Nucor teammates and “shepherding the company through a period of unprecedented growth as well as the harrowing recession of the late 2000s.” Congratulations to Dan and the entire Nucor team.
