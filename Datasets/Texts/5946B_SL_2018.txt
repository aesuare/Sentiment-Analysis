             Dear Fellow Shareholders
As I look back at 2018, the words that come to mind are, “Getting Started.” What an incredible start it has been. At the conclusion
of my first 18 months at ServiceMaster, we see the beginning of a great transformation and the increase of positive energy across our businesses. We are proud of the progress we have made, but believe that there is much more to do to create meaningful impacts and deliver incredible value.
We are blessed with fairly recession-resistant, growing markets in an increasingly challenging political and economic environment. We continue to build a stable operating system positioned to capture sustainable opportunities for profitable growth, while steadily building strong capabilities in our people, processes and systems.
It is a privilege to be part of this special organization with over 40,000 people who serve over 50,000 customers every day, providing them with cleaner, healthier, safer environments wherever they are — at home, at work or at play.
This mission, our purpose and who we ultimately aspire to become are defined by our three core commitments:
We Serve: We aspire to deliver an unparalleled customer experience, whether protecting our customers’ health from the effects of harmful pests, returning them to a safe place to live or work by carefully restoring their lives or ensuring they breathe freely in an environment which we have kept meticulously clean. At ServiceMaster, we believe through service and care, we have the power to impact and improve lives and

drive growth in our businesses. This core belief is at the heart of how we are shaping our future, working with employees and franchise associates, and re-imagining our customer journeys to deliver memorable experiences to our customers at every touch point.
We Care: Listening to our employees in the field and instilling their learnings in our processes and systems allows us to remove obstacles from their paths, enabling them to deliver an unmatched customer experience. Enhancing benefits, optimizing work hours, improving pay-for-performance structures and creating career paths tailored to deserving employees’ aspirations demonstrates our deep care for them in their quest to deliver outstanding service.
We are creating a workplace that respects creativity, initiative, diversity of thought and cultural inclusion by recognizing talent and perseverance at every level. We have increased our community outreach because service and care are at the heart of who we are.
We Deliver: Credibility is extremely important. We have significantly improved our ability to deliver on our commitments to our customers, employees, partners, shareholders and to each other.
Our shareholders have benefited from our great start and have seen their total shareholder return rise by $4.0 billion (75 percent) between July 2017 and March 1, 2019, as described and shown in the graph on page 14.
We have made significant improvements in our business by enhancing our brands
and renewing our focus, providing exceptional customer experiences that have historically been the hallmark of what had made ServiceMaster a successful company. The enhancements started with a stronger commitment to our customers and an improvement of our core service capabilities to delight them. Some of our proudest accomplishments include:
• Delivering considerable value to our shareholders through the spinoff of American Home Shield (now Frontdoor), giving our shareholders ownership of two strong publicly traded companies with increased flexibility and capital positions.
• Continuing to deliver on the Terminix transformation by focusing on fundamentals and accountability, resulting in rapidly improving organic pest growth rates and a strengthened termite business.
• Building a dedicated team to better serve the needs of our commercial and national account customers through our Copesan acquisition, strong commercial processes and capabilities, and adding incredible talent.
• Strengthening our capabilities and competitive advantages with acquisitions, like Cooper Pest and Assured Environments — models for urban market penetration, improved bed bug programs and organic growth best practices.
• Launching ServiceMaster Brands (formerly Franchise Services Group), reflecting a bold vision for our restoration and cleaning segments, outlining a broadened growth strategy in these important markets, and focusing on the end customer and service differentiation.
• Developing an enterprise strategy, mission and corporate value system setting a course toward a business and cultural transformation. This is the core of our vision to be the best in the eyes of our customers, the employer of choice and ultimately, a company considered a stable investment for shareholders.

• Taking a major step in using lean, clean-sheet principles to dramatically improve our service delivery models led by our customer-facing associates, and developing a leading-edge data platform supported by our partnership with Salesforce.
As a result of the efforts of people across our company, ServiceMaster reported strong results for 2018.
• Grew revenue 8 percent to $1.9 billion, including organic growth of 2 percent at Terminix and 9 percent at ServiceMaster Brands
• Increased adjusted EBITDA to $398 million, while investing in growth
• Delivered free cash flow of $187 million, up 35 percent from 2017
• Significantly reduced debt and solidified our balance sheet
The actions we have taken and the foundation we have started to build excite me about our future. We are better positioned to serve our customers, capitalize on new opportunities, and continue creating value for our shareholders and employees in the years to come.
We will focus on five clear strategic priorities in 2019:
• Terminix improvement: We are absolutely focused on driving operational improvement across our Terminix business, with a special focus on exceptional customer experiences that will improve our customer retention. As a result of the work to date, our net promoter score — a leading indicator of retention improvement — continue to improve in both pest and termite. They were up 5 percent and 7 percent respectively for the year.
• Commercial pest management: We will continue to leverage the significant capability investments we made in 2018 to build a world-class commercial pest management business that delights our customers.
• Growth through innovation and international expansion: Our innovation center is driving dozens of new offerings across our businesses. In addition, we are developing market- entry strategies to expand our businesses in attractive global markets, leveraging our strong brands, size and scale.
• ServiceMaster Brands: We are beginning to identify and deliver more value from our restoration and cleaning businesses, which generated $2.6 billion in 2018 customer-level revenue. Value creation opportunities in this business include greater focus on the end customer and the complete value chain, growing beyond our franchise services through a broader network of franchisees, contractors and company-owned operations.
• Empower our true competitive advantage — Talent: Growth through service starts with empowering our front-line employees to deliver a better customer experience with streamlined processes, technology and a 360-degree customer view.
Looking forward to 2019, we will be satisfied with nothing less than delivering an unparalleled service experience to our customers, a deep-rooted culture of care for our employees and franchise associates, and delivering strong financial performance. Thank you for your continued support and for choosing to invest in your company.
