                 With almost 15,000 of the most dedicated and highly trained people in our industry, Quanta has the ability to respond in even the most challenging environments. This was especially evident during the aftermath of Hurricane Ike, when our Houston- based employees joined thousands of coworkers from across the nation to provide emergency restoration services to those suffering significant setbacks from the storm.
Profile Quanta Services is a leading national provider of specialized contracting services, offering comprehensive network solutions to the electric power, gas, telecommunications and cable television industries. Quanta’s services include engineering, design, installation, repair and maintenance of network infrastructure of any configuration, in any region, located in any type of terrain.
I am pleased to report that Quanta Services achieved another year of solid performance in 2008. Despite a very challenging economic environment, revenues reached record levels, and we continued to grow our backlog of work. Demand for infrastructure services remained high, especially in the areas of power transmission and renewable energy. During the year, our financial strength, diversity and emphasis on renewables were the primary elements that allowed us to capitalize on increasing demand and build on our market-leading position. These are also among the strengths that leave us well positioned for further success in 2009 and beyond.
A Position of Strength
Revenues in 2008 were a record $3.78 billion, compared to $2.66 billion in 2007, resulting in an increase of approximately 42.3 percent. Operating income rose to $289.2 million in 2008 from $169.5 million in 2007 for an increase of 70.6 percent. At year-end, our twelve-month backlog, which is defined as the work expected to be completed under signed contracts over the next 12 months, was $2.58 billion. Our total backlog of work expected to be performed under signed contracts in the future was $5.19 billion. We believe our performance in 2008 along with our twelve-month and total backlog levels indicate another strong year for Quanta in 2009, although it is currently unclear as to what the ultimate impact of the nation’s economic crisis will be on our business.
Our financial flexibility also improved in 2008. At year-end, we had approximately $438 million in cash and $315 million of available borrowing capacity under our $475 million senior secured revolving credit facility. Additionally, the holders of almost all of our $270 million aggregate principal amount of 4.5 percent convertible subordinated notes exchanged their notes for equity in Quanta. This leaves Quanta with no significant maturities of debt until September 2012. With our strong cash position and credit availability, we have the financial strength to fund almost any project, as well as the ability to capitalize on opportunities in the industries we serve.
A Commitment to Diverse Customer Base, Revenues and Services
Diversity is the cornerstone of Quanta, beginning with our geographic reach and scale of operations. Our nationwide presence allows us to serve customers across the United States, which is important for those with networks spanning multiple states or regions. The scale of our operations also allows us to quickly mobilize employees for emergency restoration services.

                  Throughout 2008, Quanta Services was awarded several significant transmission contracts. Quanta recently announced the expansion of its contract with Northeast Utilities (NU). The value of the contract for transmission infrastructure services is now estimated at $950 million over eight years.
Our diversity extends to our customer base as well, which lends strength
to the ongoing growth of our revenue base. In 2008, our largest customer
made up only 4.4 percent of our revenues. Our top ten customers
represented 30.3 percent of our total revenues, and our top twenty
4200
customers made up approximately 43.3 percent of revenues. Diversity can
also be found in our types of revenues. In 2008, 57 percent of revenues
were derived from electric power services, 21 percent from gas services,
14 percent from telecommunications and cable television services,
7 percent from ancillary services and approximately 2 percent from
3600
dark fiber licensing.
Quanta delivers diverse services across the electric power, gas,
telecommunications and cable television industries. This allows us to offer
complete solutions for virtually any type of network infrastructure. Each
3000
employee receives extensive training with a core focus on safe operations. Regardless of the service provided, safety is always the top priority.
Electric Power & Gas
2400
Our electric power and gas operations have continued to perform
strongly. Demand remains high, and it appears that our top customers
remain financially stable despite the current economic environment. We
secured several significant contracts in 2008, including an Oklahoma
Gas and Electric contract for the construction of approximately 120 miles
1800
of 345,000-volt transmission infrastructure near Oklahoma City. We
also successfully completed a major transmission project for Northeast
Utilities (NU) that contributed to the Middletown-Norwalk line being
energized ahead of schedule and below budget. In January 2009,
we expanded our second contract with NU to a total anticipated value
1200
of $950 million. This contract covers various transmission projects in the northeastern United States and is currently in the pre-construction phase. Also in the first quarter of 2009, we signed a contract with National Grid to provide engineering and installation services throughout the New England region.

In 2008, our gas operations successfully completed various projects related to the Barnet Shale natural gas gathering initiatives. Looking forward, we see opportunities in natural gas gathering and pipeline
installation and maintenance services, although recently this industry

has been impacted by reduced demand and lower natural gas prices.

Representative solar generation projects completed in 2008 include a two-megawatt, ground-mounted system at the Denver International Airport and a 10-megawatt photovoltaic facility near Boulder City, Nevada. The Boulder City project involved the installation of more than 167,000 solar modules on more than 80 acres of land designated as a renewable energy zone and is now considered the largest thin-film solar installation in North America.
Telecommunications, Cable Television & Dark Fiber
Our telecommunications and cable television operations represented a significant portion of our business in 2008. Though AT&T and Verizon remain committed to their fiber-to-the-node projects, implementation will likely be at a reduced pace through at least the first half of 2009. We believe this business to be promising in the long term. We also remain committed to our dark fiber licensing business, which continues to experience a high level of demand primarily in the education and healthcare industries.
A Resource for Renewables
Renewable energy is a rapidly emerging opportunity for Quanta. With our nationwide reach, more than 14,500 employees and the financial strength to fund large projects, we are well positioned to capitalize on the increasing focus on reducing carbon emissions. We believe our strong relationships with utilities are a key element to support the growth of our business in the development of renewable generation infrastructure and grid interconnections. We achieved our renewable revenues goal of $150 million in 2008, and we expect that number will increase to at least $300 million in 2009. We have also built a solid foundation in solar generation, as evidenced by the Denver International Airport solar project, as well as the recently completed installation of Sempra Generation’s 10-megawatt photovoltaic power generation facility near Boulder City, Nevada. The Nevada installation is currently considered the largest thin-film solar power project in North America.
Over the past year, we also streamlined the cost of engineering, design, procurement, project management and construction solutions related to large-scale utility and commercial solar generation facilities. As the price of solar panel generation continues to become more competitive with other alternative energy solutions, we believe the solar market will grow substantially.
Services related to wind generation comprised the majority of our renewable revenues in 2008. Though wind generation lost some momentum in late 2008, capital began to flow back into this market in early 2009. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) extended the renewable tax credits for wind

                  By 2018, more than 16,000 MW of new wind power must be installed to meet the U.S. Department of Energy’s goal of 20 percent U.S. wind generation by 2030. Quanta plans to apply its decade of wind experience to help diversify the nation’s energy portfolio and connect these new generation sources to the transmission grid.

The ARRA includes provisions for investments in renewable energy,

energy efficiency and related infrastructure, as well as rural broadband networks. We believe this stimulus plan along with the enforcement of Renewable Portfolio Standards in 29 states will provide additional opportunities for Quanta over the next several years.
      Closing Thoughts
2400
 This letter could not possibly be complete without recognizing our
employees whose lives were disrupted by the hurricanes, ice storms and
fires that occurred in 2008. Hurricane Ike struck Houston, yet our
2000
operations did not miss a beat. Many of our employees left their homes and families to support restoration efforts, while their own houses remained without power. We are grateful for our employees’ courage and commitment during a very challenging situation.

In 2008, we continued to strengthen our executive team. Jim O’Neil took his post as President and Chief Operating Officer in October 2008. Since joining Quanta nearly a decade ago, Jim has been instrumental in improving our operations, and I know he will continue to apply his expertise, dedication and drive to our future success.
1200
In closing, I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. Though I am pleased with our performance in 2008, I believe Quanta is positioned for even greater success in the future.
