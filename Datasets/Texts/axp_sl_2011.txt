To Ou r S hareholders:

Never let anyone tell you what you can't accomplish. My father shared this advice with me when I was growing up. And, throughout the past year, my colleagues at American Express often reminded me of those words. Our people produced strong growth in a weak environment, cutting-edge innovation from a 160-year-old company, and healthy shareholder returns in a volatile market. It was a year of setting new standards.
We earned a record $4.9  billion in net income, up 22  percent from the prior year. Sharply higher spending by our cardmembers and excellent credit quality drove our performance. Revenues net of interest expense rose 9 percent to $30 billion. Our cardmembers swiped, clicked and tapped their way to a record $822 billion in purchases, an increase of 15 percent from a year ago. We enjoyed broad-based growth in spending among consumers, small businesses and corporations in every region of the world--all while facing a tepid economy, stubborn unemployment and low consumer confidence.

Keeping our customers satisfied was the key. We earned their loyalty by providing greater value through industry-leading benefits, rewards and service. We gave them more ways to make purchases online and offline, through an expanding merchant network and new payment alternatives. And, as more spending shifted online, we were right there with our cardmembers, corporate clients and merchant partners, making e-commerce easy, secure and rewarding. These factors also help explain why we did so well attracting more high-spending, creditworthy prospects into our franchise. We added 6.4 million cards-in-force during the year, which brought our total to 97.4 million. First-year spending levels for these new customers were the highest we've seen since the recession. As worldwide billings among both tenured and new cardmembers grew, credit quality improved. By year-end, write-off and 30-day past-due rates were at historic lows. Writeoffs in our worldwide lending portfolio fell to 2.3 percent for the fourth quarter compared with 4.3  percent a year ago. Our credit performance far outpaced the industry.

Net income rose 22% from 2010 to a record $4.9 billion.

Better credit quality enabled us to reduce the amount of money we set aside in provisions for losses by 50  percent, which freed up funds for business- building investments.

+ I n v e s t m e n t s a n d Eff i c i e n c y We aim to be both flexible and opportunistic when it comes to investment spending. Coming out of the recession, we saw a competitive opening and increased our investments. We focused on marketing and promotion, cardmember rewards and services, strategic acquisitions and other new business opportunities­all of which were designed to aid growth in the coming years. Our performance, combined with settlement payments received from Visa and MasterCard, gave us more dollars to spend, so we put those funds to good use. This contributed to higher operating expenses. In the second half of 2011, as the Visa and MasterCard settlement payments were phasing out and releases from loss reserves were diminishing, we deliberately

slowed expense growth. Expenses rose by just 1 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with 13 percent for the full year. We will continue to focus on controlling expenses by driving efficiency, reducing costs and increasing quality throughout the organization, while still investing at healthy levels to fuel growth. Across our businesses, 2011 saw us reach some historic milestones. For example, we: · Received our fifth consecutive J.D. Power and Associates award for highest customer satisfaction among credit card companies in the U.S. · Passed the $100 billion mark in annual billings on cards issued by Global Network Services partners, a tremendous achievement for this business, which has greatly expanded the presence of our brand in many countries. · Mobilized an estimated 103 million Americans to shop small on the second annual Small Business Saturday, a movement we created to support independently owned stores and restaurants that are the lifeblood of local communities across the U.S. · Added more than 1 million card-accepting merchant locations to our global network.

An estimated 103 million Americans shopped small on the second annual Small Business Saturday.

+ Ou r T r a n s f o r m at i o n If one sentence could sum up the year, it would be this: We grew today while transforming the business for tomorrow. I've already taken you through the first part of that statement. Now let's explore the second part. I believe that we have started the next major transformation of American Express­our evolution as a digital services company. Transformation is in our blood. It's why we have been successful for more than a century and a half, and why we've never been more successful than now. We are making major progress in driving digital advances across our core businesses. When some of the world's leading companies in the social media space tell you that they are excited by the things you are doing and impressed by how fast you move, you know you are on the right track. That's exactly what happened with a series of digital payments firsts that we introduced this year. · The national rollout of a deals platform with foursquare that automatically delivers merchant offers to enrolled cardmembers right on their mobile phones when they check in at participating locations.

· Link, Like, Love: a first-of-its-kind Facebook application that provides deals, access and experiences based on the "likes," interests and social connections of our cardmembers. · Go Social: a site that enables small business merchants in the U.S. to create couponless deals for cardmembers on digital and mobile platforms. In just a few minutes, a merchant can create an offer from scratch and distribute it directly to cardmembers on Facebook and foursquare. Each one of these innovations in mobile, location-based commerce is powered by our unique SmartOffer technology, which draws on merchant and cardmember data from our closed-loop network. Targeted offers are delivered seamlessly to mobile devices, without the need for coupons, and statement credits appear automatically on cardmembers' accounts. While these efforts are still in the early stages, we believe in the long-term potential to create value for more cardmembers and merchants through increasingly powerful mobile commerce tools. There are many other examples of digital advances across all areas of our business­such as the continued evolution of Membership Rewards as a virtual currency; enhanced online servicing capabilities and apps; and expanded e-commerce options in our Global Corporate Payments business, where about 80 percent of all spending now takes place without swiping a piece of plastic.

Those changes are happening in our so-called traditional businesses. Then there are wholly new opportunities being pursued by our Enterprise Growth Group. We launched Enterprise Growth in 2010 to help accelerate our progress in developing alternative payments products, reach customers beyond our traditional base and create new revenue opportunities. This work is well under way. In March, we launched SERVE, our new digital payments and commerce platform, which gives consumers new ways to spend, send and receive money. SERVE lets consumers make purchases and person-to-person payments online, via mobile devices and at millions of merchants who accept American Express cards. In market trials held during the year, some people told us that they never thought American Express was for them, and that SERVE was a useful, if surprising, alternative. That was actually music to our ears, as we look for the opportunity to fit the right products to an expanding customer base. We quickly signed 15 partners who are embedding SERVE into their ecosystems and offerings, including Ticketmaster, Verizon, Sprint and AOL. And we just announced an agreement with Lianlian Group, which will use SERVE's technology to power a digital wallet that will be offered to millions of consumers in China. We are still in the early stages of SERVE's development, with a long way to go to build the kind of digital capabilities and scale that will be critical to the platform's ultimate success. But we are encouraged by the progress we've seen. Other notable launches from Enterprise Growth this year included a game-changing prepaid card in the U.S. that has no purchase or maintenance fees, as well as our first-ever prepaid card in India. We also launched a joint venture with vente-privee.com to bring Europe's leader in online private sales of luxury goods to the U.S. market. In November, American Express announced a multiyear initiative to invest $100 million in early-stage start-ups that are developing innovative digital commerce technologies.

We will focus on areas such as loyalty and rewards, mobile, online payment management, fraud detection and data analysis. There's tremendous creativity and new ideas out there that we want to tap into. At the same time, we possess unique assets and capabilities of our own that we believe will help us win in the digital age.

+ T h e D i g i ta l C o n v e r g e n c e The social Web, mobile devices and the Cloud are dramatically changing how people experience the world, shape their identities, access what they want, and expect to be served. People are connected as never before, consuming and generating vast amounts of data in real time, minute by minute, every day, virtually wherever they go. These forces are having a profound effect on commerce. In a world where smartphones and tablets literally put the Web in your hands, online and physical commerce are converging. The Web has become an indispensable part of the shopping cycle, and more and more consumers are accessing the Web right in the store for information to help them make purchase decisions. This creates tremendous opportunities for service providers who have the data, insights and relationships that can empower consumers and merchants to make commerce fast, secure and more rewarding. The digital convergence is all about information and generating value from that information. This convergence falls completely into our sweet spot. We have a network that connects millions of consumers, merchants and businesses around the globe in a payments and commerce ecosystem that creates value for all its constituents. Our business is built on relationships, insights gleaned from data, and the ability to use these assets to enhance lives and build business success for our customers.

+ A C h a ll e n g i n g E n v i r o n m e n t As you can see, I'm excited about our future and the opportunities to help our customers in new and expanding ways. But I'm also realistic about the many challenges ahead. We face difficult economies across most of our major markets. Many things could stall the recovery, or throw it into reverse, including the European banking crisis, the U.S. debt impasse, the prospect of slower growth in China and still-high unemployment in many parts of the world. While we have seen some increasingly encouraging economic data of late, there's little to suggest that growth will accelerate sharply anytime soon.

New apps for smartphones and tablets allow cardmembers to access their accounts wherever they go.

Increased regulation is also creating a more complex business environment. Over the past few years, the card industry has seen the most significant period of regulatory and legislative change in its history. American Express is adapting to this new environment. Many of our bank card-issuing competitors have been affected more than we have because of their greater reliance on lending and debit cards. As legislators and regulators continue to scrutinize the financial services industry, we aim to set ourselves apart by providing excellent service and value to all of our customers. We also recognize that the bar is being raised for everyone in our industry by the expectations of both regulators and consumers. Beyond the tough economy and increased regulation, we are seeing more competition for our premium customers as others seek to emulate our success. At the same time, traditional and nontraditional competitors are all trying to crack the code on mobile commerce.

So why do we feel good when the environment is challenging, to say the least? We believe in the unique characteristics of our business model: our spend-centric focus, closed-loop network, expertise across the payments chain, premium products, trusted brand and service excellence. These and other assets can help us continue to outpace the competition and benefit from the ongoing global shift away from cash and toward online and electronic commerce. The mantra we set in 2010­drive growth, drive efficiency and deliver superior service­will continue to be our road map. We also remain committed to the investment priorities we identified last year to drive profitable growth for the company well into the future. These longer-term priorities, which complement our ongoing investments in acquiring new customers and deepening relationships across our base businesses, are:
Increase our share of online spending and improve our customers' digital experience--We're starting from a strong position here. Based on all the data

we've seen, we believe that American Express leads all issuers in online payments volume. For 2011, we conservatively estimate that our online billings totaled $130 billion, up about 22 percent from a year ago. Simply put, we benefitted from giving our customers more ways and reasons to use our products and interact with us online. As the role of e-commerce expands, we want to be the clear go-to choice.
Deliver greater value to merchants--On average, our cardmembers spend far more each year than the card holders of other payment networks. We also offer an array of services that help merchants attract new customers, build loyalty and combat fraud. If we generate more value in the form of additional customers and higher spending, and if merchants recognize it, then more of them will want to do business with us. That's what we aim to do every day.

delivered record profits in 2011. Right now, some of our most creative thinking about product features, benefits, services and co-brand partnerships is coming out of our international markets. We see plenty of opportunity to grow our proprietary card and Global Network Services businesses, while alternative categories such as prepaid and mobile can help us expand our presence in countries where traditional payments systems are less established.
Make significant progress within Enterprise Growth--As I described earlier,

we are making good progress toward developing alternative payments and revenue streams, with plenty of potential ahead.
Broaden our customer base--In particular, we want to welcome in more women, minorities and younger customers. Many of our efforts in digital payments are designed for these groups, as are efforts to give millennials who have thin credit histories a path into our franchise.

We've set an ambitious agenda. And we know we need to move fast, be flexible and challenge conventional thinking. We did those things in 2011, but we will have to do even more in the months and years ahead. Our progress over the past few years and our sense of urgency make me confident that we can reach new levels of success.

I took the opportunity to reflect on how blessed I am to have this incredible job, working with people who inspire me every day. And then I realized some thanks were in order.
