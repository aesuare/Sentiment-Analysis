To Our Shareholders,
Newell Rubbermaid is in the midst of a broad-based transformation from a collection of independent business units into a focused group of leadership platforms that demonstrate excellence in new product development, backed by best-cost manufacturing and aggressive marketing programs.
In 2004, we overcame great challenges to deliver on our earnings and cash flow commitments, and we continued to progress
in our journey to transform Newell Rubbermaid. Through our productivity program, Newell Operational Excellence, we generated $123 million in cost reductions, offsetting unprece- dented levels of raw material inflation. During 2004, we also completed a three-year restruc- turing plan, closing 84 facilities worldwide,
and we strengthened our portfolio, divesting $850 million in revenues of low-margin, non-strategic businesses.
We improved our financial consistency in 2004 and made progress in areas critical to the success of our ongoing transformation. We enter 2005 as a stronger company, better positioned to deliver value to our shareholders through increased innovation and investment behind a portfolio of powerful brands in consumer and commercial products.
  Joseph Galli
Chief Executive Officer
 In 2004, we delivered earnings of $1.39 per share(a), excluding charges, reflecting strong performance from the team in offsetting raw material inflation. Free cash flow* was also strong at $307 million after dividends, exceeding our
original expectations.
In addition to earnings and cash flow targets, we entered 2004 with a set of priorities and made significant progress to further our transformation.
Divestiture Program
One of our key learnings in 2003 was that we needed to move faster in strengthening our portfolio. In 2004, we created a stronger portfolio with powerful brands, promising innovation potential and significantly higher gross margins, by divesting $850 million in revenues of non-strategic businesses. Proceeds from these divestitures were used to reduce debt to strengthen our balance sheet.
We have also instituted a more disciplined process to evaluate and improve our portfolio. The right portfolio for Newell Rubbermaid consists of businesses that have strong brands and differentiated products with the potential for innovation and higher gross margins. Improved margins
will fund demand creation efforts for our products and enable
us to reinvest back into product development. Most of our businesses today demonstrate our desired characteristics; however, that does not mean we are going to invest equally in them. Profitability and potential returns determine how we allocate our resources.
Over 60% of our portfolio consists of businesses whose operating margins and return on invested capital collectively exceed our long-term target of 15%. We classify these as "Invest" businesses, and we are investing resources into top-line growth initiatives. The remaining businesses are in various stages of profitability, with returns below our long-term targets, but we have made improvements in this portion of our portfolio. In some cases this has meant making radical changes to business models or shrinking businesses into smaller, but more profitable units. We continue to focus on moving toward higher margins and returns before
executing top-line growth initiatives in these businesses.
Restructuring
We embarked on an aggressive three-year restructuring program in May 2001 to reduce costs and improve our manufacturing network and global supply chain. We completed this plan and have closed 84 facilities worldwide, reducing headcount by over 12,000. Through 2004, we realized approximately $100 million in annualized savings and expect to realize an additional $25-$50 million in 2005.
Completing this restructuring plan is a significant milestone
for the company, and I extend my congratulations to our employees for their tremendous efforts. This plan proved to be more difficult to execute than we originally thought in 2001, yet the team stayed focused and successfully closed a breathtaking number of facilities, relocated production and maintained customer service levels — all within our timeframe
                                                                                                                                                                    2
*Defined on page 6.

   and budget. As a result, we have achieved permanent reductions in our fixed-cost base and are better positioned to support future efforts in new product development. We recognize our competitive landscape is continuously changing, therefore, we remain committed to evaluating our cost base and taking the necessary steps to become the "best cost" supplier of our products.
Newell Operational Excellence
It is critical to have a process for achieving cost savings on an ongoing basis in facilities we continue to operate. Newell Operational Excellence (NWL OPEX) is the process we have developed using best practices from methodologies such as Six Sigma, Kaizen, Kanban and other lean manufacturing principles. Our rollout of this program in 2002 introduced a new mindset of continuous improvement in manufacturing.
In 2004, we further improved our prospects for this program with the in-depth training of more than 5,000 employees in our processes, metrics and targets, and by dedicating additional resources to drive accountability at all levels of the organization. This further implementation of NWL OPEX allowed us to realize $123 million in productivity savings.
"How We Win"
Our "How We Win" Roadmap for Success is a powerful formula that has driven considerable change at
Newell Rubbermaid. It is a comprehensive approach that not only addresses financial measures and strategic focus, but also encompasses organizational development, our day-to- day operating cycle and our culture. We remain focused on these fundamentals, which will allow us to create a world- class organization that will win in the marketplace.
Our "How We Win" Roadmap:
however, we are committed to doing the right thing for the long-term health of the organization. We believe that Newell Rubbermaid is capable of delivering internal sales growth in the range of 2%-4% long term. This is achievable through new product introductions, new market categories and select market share and geographic expansion.
Operating Income* (OI) as a percent of sales was 9.5% for 2004. Compared to the prior year, this reflects relatively flat gross margins with an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A). Our long-term target for operating income is 15%. As we continue to invest in growth initiatives, we believe that SG&A will increase and level out around 20%, making gross margin expansion critical to achieving our long-term OI target. Gross margin performance in 2004 was hampered by record raw material inflation of $116 million. Although we experienced gross margin declines in the first half of 2004, we responded with productivity savings and pricing initiatives in the second half of the year, exiting 2004 with positive momentum and gross margin expansion. Raw material pressure will be more challenging in 2005; however, through a combination of productivity and price increases, we expect to overcome this near-term challenge and demonstrate gross margin improvement for the full year 2005.
Working Capital* as a percent of sales improved to 23.7%
in 2004. Our team demonstrated excellent results in working capital management over the past four years, driving working capital down from 29% to its current level. Our long-term goal is a 20% level, which we expect to achieve primarily through inventory reductions and accounts payable management. We have shown good progress here and anticipate ongoing annual improvements.
Free Cash Flow*, which we calculate after dividends, improved to $307 million in 2004. This strong performance reflects improved capital spending discipline. In 2004,
we spent $122 million on fixed capital, while historical annual spending ranged from $250-$300 million. With a focus on reducing the operating leverage of our businesses, we are exiting low-margin, capital-intensive product lines through divestiture and discontinuance, and are working to shift some of the fixed capital burden to our supply partners. We have also become more disciplined at deploying our own fixed capital, prioritizing investments into high-margin, high-return businesses. With our emphasis on de-capitalization, a range of $125-$150 million in capital spending is an appropriate level to support strategic initiatives in our current portfolio and to allow us to generate free cash flow in line with earnings growth.
Return on Invested Capital* showed modest improvement to 9.6%, reflecting progress in reducing our asset base and debt levels. Our focus on improving profitability, combined with investment discipline, should allow us to improve this metric to reach our long-term goal of at least 15%.
Our strategy is comprised of six company-wide, transformational initiatives. Following this
approach will allow us to further develop our core competencies and deliver improvements in our financial metrics. Our strategic initiatives are productivity, streamlining, new product development, marketing, strategic account management and collaboration.
Productivity. Productivity is reducing the cost of products sold through purchasing, manufacturing and distribution and transportation initiatives. Productivity gains can be achieved whether we manufacture domestically or overseas, in our own facilities or through an outsourced model. As I mentioned, NWL OPEX is in its early stages. A change of this magnitude
    1 The Right Measures
  2 The Right Strategy The Right
  3 The Right Organization
   4 The Right Operating Cycle
   5 The Right Culture
   Our five key financial metrics include internal sales growth, operating income as a percent
of sales, working capital as a percent of sales, free cash flow and return on invested capital. Together, these metrics balance profitability and asset utilization to drive the right behavior for the long-term success of Newell Rubbermaid.
Internal Sales Growth* declined 2.0% in 2004. This performance reflects our strategic decision to exit certain low-margin product lines of approximately $275 million, or 4% of sales. These products were in categories that did not reward innovation or brands with premium price, making near-term and potential long-term returns unattractive for us.
In 2005, we will continue to move away from low-margin categories and expect to exit an additional $200 million in sales. These exits put short-term pressure on sales growth;

takes time to institutionalize. As our operating rhythm improves, our team will generate additional savings every year. Our 2004 productivity savings were $123 million, or 2.8%, and we remain committed to our internal goal to generate 5% in productivity savings every year. Through NWL OPEX, we plan to further reduce scrap, waste, rework and rejects and improve material flow, generating higher levels of cost reductions in 2005.
Streamlining. Streamlining is reducing non-strategic selling, general and administrative expenses. Streamlining savings are reinvested in strategic areas to support growth initiatives. In 2004, we were able to fund additional investment in prod- uct development and advertising in our Office Products seg- ment through streamlining unnecessary administrative costs.
New Product Development. Newell Rubbermaid is committed to developing high-quality, innovative products
that command premium pricing. We are implementing a consistent product development process across our organization that begins with identifying unmet needs and developing solutions to deliver the ideal end-user experience. New product development will be a core competency for Newell Rubbermaid. With the completion of the restructuring plan, we are prioritizing our investment in this critical initiative. Today, the new product pipelines in our businesses are in different stages of excellence, but examples of our 2004 launches provide evidence of our traction.
Calphalon® OneTM
Calphalon has been a favorite in gourmet cookware for over 40 years. The Calphalon® OneTM series of products is an exceptional line to continue the heritage of this great
brand. Infused Anodized technology, exclusive to Calphalon® OneTM, is a breakthrough in cookware performance. An advanced-release polymer infused into the metal, creates a surface that delivers the classic results expected from tradi- tional cookware, with the added benefit of controlled food release. This performance is unmatched in the marketplace. The second product line in the series, Calphalon® OneTM Nonstick, also features an innovative cooking surface. It is engineered with a proprietary matrix of four interlocking nonstick layers, resulting in superior nonstick durability.
IRWIN® Blue BladeTM and LENOX GoldTM
IRWIN Industrial Tools and LENOX, makers of hand tools and power tool accessories, also brought proprietary innovation to the market- place with their entries into utility knives and
blades. Both IRWIN® Blue BladeTM and LENOX GoldTM feature bi-metal technology. Constructed of two types of steel, the bi-metal combination produces a hardened edge that stays sharp longer, with a body that flexes to resist breaking. These features are superior to a standard carbon blade. LENOX has further enhanced its line through a titanium nitride coating process to improve the life and durability of the blade.
These highly successful new products brought demonstrable innovations to the marketplace. As we shift our company's focus to product development, our flow of new products will continue to gain momentum.
Marketing. We have tremendous strength in our portfolio
of Power Brands — we hold the number one or two brand position in virtually all of our businesses. Building equity in our Power Brands is critical to creating a long-term, defend- able market position where users insist on our brands and products. To do this, we have found that a blend of traditional television and print advertising, coupled with grassroots marketing focused on creating demand with the end user,
is appropriate for our product offerings.

 Sharpie® RT Campaign
The Sharpie® RT permanent marker offers the same great ink and product quality expected from the Sharpie® brand, in an innovative, retractable form. A fall television advertising
campaign supported the product launch by demonstrating its unique features and benefits to a diverse consumer audience, contributing to the double-digit sales growth for the Sharpie® brand in 2004.
#97 Sharpie/IRWIN Racing
For the past four years, we have actively sponsored Kurt Busch, driver of the #97 Sharpie/IRWIN Ford in the NASCAR® NEXTEL® Cup Series. Kurt had a tremendous
year in 2004, winning the series championship and inaugural NEXTEL Cup. Kurt and his successes have provided our brands with impressive media opportunities, but our grass- roots marketing support surrounding race day has provided an even greater impact. In 2004, our team was track-side at 23 NASCAR venues across the United States, demonstrating and sampling our category-leading products to brand-loyal consumers in the NASCAR community. Individual interaction creates demand for our products and strengthens recognition and preference for our Sharpie® and IRWIN® brands.
Strategic Account Management. Strategic Account Management is focusing on strong retailers to create high-growth potential distribution for new and existing product lines. Newell Rubbermaid's distribution is different compared to most of our peers. With strategic partners in discount stores, warehouse clubs, office supply, home centers, food and drug, specialty channels and commercial channels, we have very diverse distribution and are not overly concentrated in one particular channel. Newell Rubbermaid is a company that is uniquely structured to develop our business in both consumer and commercial channels.
Collaboration. Collaboration means leveraging the collective strengths of our people and our businesses to generate more value for the organization. Throughout Newell Rubbermaid, our teams are focused on executing our strategies in their divisions, but by working together, we can become better, faster. Sharing brands, leveraging manufacturing expertise, opening doors to retailer relationships, developing best prac- tices — all of these collaborative efforts allow us to overcome obstacles and maximize opportunities better than any individ- ual or division could accomplish on its own. Collaboration translates into improved performance and a competitive advantage for the businesses within Newell Rubbermaid.
Organizational devel- opment has been a true highlight for Newell Rubbermaid.
We have had a major infusion of talent that better aligns the skill set of the organization with our long-term success factors, adding expertise in product development, marketing and operational excellence. We have rewarded our high-potential employees and have presented them with developmental opportunities in our 30 divisions and sales organizations. We have created a "farm system" for talent through our Phoenix Program that targets recent college graduates, and we contin- ue to promote ambitious, proven individuals. We have also established a balance of short-term and long-term reward sys- tems to retain our people and to keep the organization focused on value creation for our shareholders.
In 2004, we further strengthened our management team with the addition of Steven G. Marton, Group President Office Products. Steven joined us from Colgate Palmolive and brings a wealth of global consumer products experience in new product development and marketing. He will lead the team in realizing the tremendous potential of this global business.
Having the Right Organization also encompasses the leadership on our board of directors. After 18 years of service, Chairman William P. Sovey retired. We are grateful for his many years of counsel and commitment to
Newell Rubbermaid. William D. Marohn, former Vice Chairman of Whirlpool Corporation, was named Chairman. He has served on our board for five years and has been a tremendous asset as we have embarked on the transformation of Newell Rubbermaid. We also welcomed to our board Michael T. Cowhig, President Global Technical
and Manufacturing at Gillette, and Mark D. Ketchum, former President Global Baby and Family Care at Procter & Gamble. These gentlemen bring significant consumer products expertise and are valuable additions to our board.
The unlimited potential we have at Newell Rubbermaid has allowed us to attract and retain outstanding talent at all levels of the organization.
Staying con- nected with our businesses is critical, and our Operating
Cycle helps us to do that. Through a series of monthly, quar- terly and annual reviews at the corporate and divisional levels, we are monitoring our progress against core metrics. This allows us to better recognize and communicate best practices and collaborate on opportunities and challenges in our busi- ness. It facilitates the timely assessment of our businesses, our management team and our competitive landscape.
Culture is a significant part of our organizational journey, and we have seen it strengthen
every year. The Newell Rubbermaid culture fosters and rewards results, customer focus, continuous improvement and breakthrough thinking. We made bold steps in 2004 to improve the long-term prospects for Newell Rubbermaid. These shared experiences strengthened our common bonds and further rooted our culture.
Looking Ahead
We will strengthen our portfolio in 2005. In fact, we have made some early progress with our January 2005 announce- ment of an agreement for the intended sale of our European Curver business, a division with $150 million in revenue within our Cleaning & Organization segment. In addition to moving away from less strategic businesses, we look to enhance the growth-oriented segments of our portfolio.
In 2005, the organization will shift focus and investment
to new product development, marketing and brand building in our high-margin businesses. With our team and our portfolio of brands, we are capable of creating a strong pipeline of innovative new products that will generate above average returns.
We will continue to execute our "How We Win" Roadmap. Focusing on our Roadmap in 2004 allowed us to make good progress, but we know that our best performance lies ahead. With confidence in our strategy and our 31,000 employees, we will continue the evolution of Newell Rubbermaid into a world-class consumer and commercial products company.
Sincerely,
Joseph Galli
Chief Executive Officer
                                                                     7

    Developing Tomorrow's Leaders
          Newell Rubbermaid's Phoenix Program is a grassroots marketing initiative that gives recent college graduates an opportunity to work with some of the most powerful brands in consumer and commercial products. High-potential representatives are deployed at strategic retailers to focus on sales and in-store merchandising, while developing experience with our products, retail partners and end-users. Individuals with valuable, practical business insights create a strong bench of talent to support the company's "promote from within" philosophy. This initiative has been very successful, and since 2001, over 650 graduates of the program have been promoted into a variety of positions throughout our 30 divisions and sales organizations.
As a Phoenix representative, Chad McDonald developed extensive product knowledge through training and conducting hands-on product demonstrations. This fueled his interest for a career in marketing. His hard work and results in the field were rewarded with a promotion to an associate marketing role in the IRWIN division. Chad's continued demonstration of leadership and project management,
Chad McDonald Product Manager

Key Account Manager
coupled with the company's commitment to collaborate across divisions, allowed him to further advance to his current position as a Product Manager in the BernzOmatic division.
Allison Burdge also began her career in the Phoenix Program, where she quickly achieved in-depth knowledge of home center retailers. Her command of the industry and her ability to effectively communicate our diverse portfolio of businesses allowed her to rapidly build credibility with customers and within Newell Rubbermaid. With her proven skill set and demonstrated results, Allison has excelled in her sales career. Currently, she is a Key Account Manager for one of our largest strategic retailers, with sales responsibility for Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Rubbermaid Foodservice and Amerock businesses.
The Phoenix Program is part of Newell Rubbermaid's long-term success, providing the company with a competitive advantage at the store level while shaping its future leaders. The company will continue to promote ambitious, proven individuals in its ongoing commitment to develop the right organization.
