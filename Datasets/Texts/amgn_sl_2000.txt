DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER:
Amgen Values
• Be science-based
• Work in teams
• Compete intensely and win
• Create value for patients, staff, and stockholders • Trust and respect each other
• Collaborate, communicate, and build consensus • Ensure quality
• Be ethical
The year 2000 was one of accomplishment and growth for Amgen, and the future has never looked more promising. This year is off to a great start with our recent victory in the Aventis/TKT litigation regarding erythropoietin in the U.S. District Court. In the next five years, we hope to more than double the size of the company in terms of revenues and products on the market. We also will substantially expand the number of patients we serve and the size of Amgen’s staff. There are challenges, to be sure, in meeting our goals, but we are confident that we have the people, the strategy, and the resources necessary to make our future even brighter than our past.
Reviewing the significant progress Amgen made toward each of the six goals established by our executive manage- ment team after I became CEO last May provides a good summary of our recent progress and plans for the future.
The first goal was to align the company around a shared aspiration built from a common set of values. We reaffirmed our commitment to eight fundamental Amgen values developed several years ago: be science-based; work in teams; compete intensely and win; create value for patients, staff, and stockholders; trust and respect each other; collaborate, communicate, and build consensus; ensure quality; and be ethical.
As a company, we also worked hard to develop a shared aspiration. The pace of scientific innovation and medical understanding is accelerating every day, making a technology- based foundation too limiting for us. At the same time, the competitive landscape is changing as the industry restructures and competition for innovative therapeutics increases in intensity. In the face of these and other changes, we strongly agreed — as a company — that one approach would serve us enduringly: focus our efforts on using science and innovation to dramatically improve people’s lives. Broadening this
thought, we agreed on a shared aspiration to become the world’s best human therapeutics company.
There is no single definition that captures what we mean by “best.” We know it includes delivering a stream of innova- tive products that dramatically improve people’s lives, being a place where the best people choose to work, and outperform- ing our peers in delivering value to shareholders. By adopting such a broad aspiration, we are committing ourselves fully to improving continuously along every important dimension of Amgen’s activities.
The second goal was to prepare to launch a stream of new products beginning in 2001, with a particular focus on ARANESPTM (darbepoetin alfa). Depending upon regulatory approvals, we could launch four new products in the next 18 months — ARANESPTM, anakinra, abarelix-depot, and SD/01. That is why we have spent heavily on clinical development to ensure our products’ characteristics are widely and thoroughly tested and documented. We have prepared and submitted regulatory filings around the world to obtain the fastest and best approvals possible. We have worked hard to understand physi- cians’ and other providers’ attitudes to be sure our messages will be persuasive and reimbursement will be available, and we have built new field forces to ensure that our voice is heard.
WebelieveARANESPTM representsanewstandardofcare for treating anemia in chronic renal failure, and in other settings. Amgen is determined to become the world leader in treating patients with all types of anemia, one of the most under-recognized and under-treated of diseases. We estimate the worldwide anemia market could be as large as $10 billion by 2005. Introducing ARANESPTM globally gives it the potential to be Amgen’s biggest product ever.
Anakinra, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), is the cornerstone of our inflammation franchise. We estimate the market for biological therapies in rheumatoid arthritis could
4

  reach $3 billion by 2005. Anakinra is unique in that it will be the only therapy that mitigates inflammation and reverses or reduces joint destruction by specifically blocking IL-1, a pivotal cytokine.
Abarelix-depot is a prostate cancer treatment with a novel mechanism of action that will distinguish it from other available therapies. In clinical trials, abarelix-depot rapidly reduces testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels without the troubling testosterone surge associated with other treatments. Abarelix-depot will compete in the hormonal therapy market for prostate cancer estimated to reach $1.5 billion by 2005 and is expected to be an important addition to our oncology franchise.
SD/01 is a longer-acting and therefore a less-frequently administered form of NEUPOGEN® (Filgrastim). We expect SD/01 to help more people successfully get through chemotherapy and stay out of the hospital by making protection from infection simpler with a once-per-cycle, “one- size-fits-all” configuration. Phase 3 trials of SD/01 have been completed, and we expect to file for regulatory approval of this therapy in the first half of 2001.
Our third goal was to expand our research and develop- ment capabilities, and grow and advance the product pipeline. R&D is the core of Amgen, and we made good progress in expanding our activities. We defined more clearly where to direct our discovery resources, added significant talent and leadership to our scientific and medical staffs, and grew our pipeline. Our core technology base is in large molecules. Our plan is both to protect and enhance this strength, by expanding to monoclonal antibody therapeutics, while continuing to grow our small molecule capabilities. We believe this three-modality approach is the one that best enables Amgen to capitalize on the increased understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets emerging in the postgenomic era.
Our acquisition of Kinetix Pharmaceuticals was an impor- tant step in continuing to build our small molecule capabilities. Choosing disease areas around which to cluster our product development activities was another important step. Increasing our R&D spending to nearly $1 billion in 2001, up from approx- imately $850 million in 2000, is yet another key toward achieving this goal.
We are very pleased with our pipeline progress. One product application was filed in the U.S., and applications for two products were filed in the European Union, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. We started, or made the decision to start, four registration trials and received one line extension. One new product candidate already in clinical development was in-licensed, and we in-licensed or acquired another eight research and preclinical projects. We plan in 2001 to begin five new product-registration and label-extension trials and file two new-product or label-extension applications in the U.S. and other countries. Also, we continue aggressive efforts to acquire product opportunities from outside Amgen.
Goal four was to strengthen our organization capabilities and help our staff grow professionally. We did this with the addition of Roger Perlmutter, MD, PhD, as executive vice president of Research and Development and George Morrow as executive vice president of Worldwide Sales and Marketing. Roger Perlmutter formerly was executive vice president of Worldwide Basic Research and Preclinical Development for Merck Research Laboratories. George Morrow formerly was president and CEO of GlaxoWellcome, North America. We also hired several additional executives with broad industry experi- ence in research and development at the vice president level.
Despite these additions, we have more work to do in the area of developing our staff. The Executive Committee is focusing more time and effort on this issue than ever before, and I expect to be able to report significant progress on this

 front in next year’s annual report. Another area in which we need to make greater progress is diversity. We have made some progress — for example, we now have eight women vice presidents, up from three a year ago. But we are redoubling our efforts and taking a more broad-based and energetic approach to fully tap the potential of the widest range of possible contributors to Amgen’s work. We are committed to making advances in this area.
Our fifth goal was to be successful in the Aventis/TKT erythropoietin patent litigation. We won in the U.S. District Court thanks to a magnificent effort by our legal team, led by General Counsel Steve Odre and Vice President of Intellectual Property Stuart Watt. This successful defense of our intellectual property was important, not only for Amgen but for our entire industry.
Goal six was to deliver on our short-term financial prom- ises and, at the same time, invest wisely for the future. Amgen has an outstanding record in providing value to shareholders, and we are working hard to continue to deliver. We achieved our profit targets in 2000 even though U.S. NEUPOGEN® sales were somewhat short of expectations. NEUPOGEN® is used in support of patients undergoing chemotherapy, and some changes in chemotherapy usage patterns have resulted in less NEUPOGEN® usage in those settings. However, overall, more patients than ever are receiving NEUPOGEN®, and we expect NEUPOGEN® salestogrowthisyear.
As I write this letter today, Amgen’s stock price has grown by 12 percent in the last twelve months while stocks in general have performed worse, with the S&P 500 declining by 13 percent. As we now prepare to launch ARANESPTM, I recall the historic day in December 1998 when arbitrators affirmed Amgen’s exclusive rights to ARANESPTM. Since that day, Amgen’s stock price has increased by 195 percent versus the performance of the S&P 500, which increased by 1 percent.
Looking forward, sales and earnings are expected to accel- erate beginning in 2001, fueled by new product launches. By 2005, five or more new products may be launched that could drive product sales to the $8 to 9 billion range.
Don Rice and Paul Reason recently joined our board, bringing a wealth of industry and government experience. At the same time, Gordon Binder, our CEO from October 1988 to May 2000, has retired and left our board. Gordon’s dedication to the company and our purpose was unmatched, and all the people at Amgen deeply appreciate his tireless efforts and the extraordinary results Amgen achieved under his leadership.
