DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS

In a difficult environment, Alberto Culver Company produced an outstanding fiscal 2008. By any measure, the coming year looks as if it will present even greater challenges. Every company ­ including Alberto Culver ­ will face difficulties. Of course, our categories have always been challenging and extremely competitive. There is seldom a moment to celebrate a win; it is always on to the next innovation and the next hurdle. But we count ourselves extremely lucky to be in the business of beauty. Beauty brands play a vital role in the lives of women and their families in good times and in tough times. Whatever the economic environment, women the world over count on our products for the confidence that comes from a great appearance or for a special moment of indulgence. We understand the beauty consumer. We live, listen, dream, and empathize with her and try our best to turn her needs into tomorrow's innovative products. We grow through mining consumer insights, driving innovation and continuing to build a brand portfolio that offers a broad array of consumer choice with little overlap. We work with superb suppliers who bring to us the key building blocks from fragrance to packaging to technology and who share our passion to be on-trend or ahead of trend. We have the privilege of partnering with the best retailers in the world who work with us and inspire us to find new ways every day to surprise and delight consumers. We believe we have the best team of people in the industry, who keep us winning by understanding our consumer, sharing our values and executing new initiatives with enthusiasm, precision, pride and passion. All of these groups understand that when there are challenges, there are also opportunities and throughout Alberto Culver's history during tougher economic cycles we have won by investing in our brands, growing our positions and gaining market share.

THE BEAUT Y OF MOMENTUM

We are very proud of what we have accomplished during fiscal 2008. For the past year, Alberto Culver has been the fastest-growing company in the hair care category in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Mexico and Australia. This follows a decade of outstanding performance with the past five years producing total company compound annual growth rates of 10% for sales and more than 25% for pre-tax profits coupled with strong margin growth. Our TRESemmé and Nexxus brands have both shown very strong growth. TRESemmé has become the number-one styling brand in the U.S. and the total brand worldwide has shown a compound growth rate of 30% over the past five years. This year, TRESemmé extended its global footprint into Spain. Nexxus has grown to be the number-two salon brand at mass retail and one of the fastest growing styling brands in the U.S. Alberto VO5 is the number-one opening price point brand in the U.S. and the number-two brand in the entire hair care category in the U.K. In skin care, St. Ives is the number-one facial scrub in each of our key markets and, in October 2008, we added the iconic Noxzema brand to our skin care portfolio. We believe there will be great future opportunities and growth for each of these winning brands. Additional accomplishments for each can be found in the sections that follow. In our 2008 fiscal year, net sales increased 9.7% to $1.44 billion from $1.32 billion in the prior year. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange rates, organic sales increased 8.7% for the year. Pre-tax income from continuing operations, which includes restructuring and discrete items of $7.3 million in the current year and $33.1 million in the prior year, increased to $170.8 million from $100.8 million in 2007. One of the strengths of the Alberto Culver Company continues to be our ability to look beyond the current quarter or the current year and build for the long term. During the past year, we opened a new 475,000 square foot manufacturing plant in Jonesboro, Arkansas. Built to take full advantage of LEAN manufacturing practices, the plant was completed ­ from groundbreaking to start of production ­ in 51 weeks. With this plant we have been able to consolidate the production from three smaller facilities which were subsequently closed.

In addition, we have strengthened key processes supporting our supply chain which has allowed us to improve our working capital management. In addition, a major overhaul of our information technology systems has made substantive progress during the year and a pilot of our global ERP system is scheduled to "go live" early in calendar year 2009. With all this progress the company remains in a strong financial position with the resources to continue to grow. Especially important, given the economic conditions all companies are facing, we have an extremely strong balance sheet with significant liquidity and no debt. Thinking long-term can also lead us to leave certain businesses. This year, the company sold its Nordic-based Cederroth business to an independent investment group. We concluded that this business, whose product portfolio included dozens of small brands ranging from first-aid to vitamins and from steel wool to detergents, was too complex to fit our strategy and that time and resources could be better deployed against our core beauty brands. We take great pride in our 2008 accomplishments and are even more proud of the people and brands that made them possible.
CONTINUING TO BUILD A GROWTH ENVIRONMENT

For the past year, Alberto Culver has been the fastestgrowing company in the hair care category in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Mexico and Australia.

Innovation. Passion. Focus. A street-fighter mentality. Defined strategy. A strong management team with the willingness to rethink our business every day. Risk takers who understand we cannot just follow the practices of our huge competitors. A Board that sees its role as strategic and focused on adding value for shareholders. A team that buys into our goals and priorities. And a culture that puts all of this to work in a values-driven, team-centered, ethical environment. We compete against some of the biggest, and work with some of the finest, companies in the world. To continue to win, we have to try to maximize every advantage that our smaller size affords us. We must strive to encourage innovative thinking by recognizing and moving on new ideas fast ­ creativity and innovation must be our competitive edge. We should be able to take advantage of a flat, de-layered organization by moving with good speed in every aspect of our business from decision-making to execution.

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

Innovation is the life blood of consumer products and we have to ensure it's a part of the DNA of every employee in the company. We also have to maintain a keen awareness that all good ideas do not have to come from within our buildings. Suppliers and retail customers bring unique insight, often from a broader perspective. Some of our best ideas for reinvention have come from new employees who bring fresh ideas and new perspectives. We work to communicate our strategies and priorities to every member of our team. Our nationally-recognized cultural framework defines the way we play and the way we win. Building from that framework, created in the mid-90s and since shared with other companies both in national publications and private meetings, we work ­ and hire ­ to a shared set of values and from our focus on innovative thinking. We hire from among the best companies and the best schools in the world, getting new team members who contribute new ideas and new thinking. In return, we offer an environment where those ideas can be quickly recognized and put into motion. Our team finds tremendous opportunities for personal advancement and the opportunity for involvement in teams that reach across every aspect of our operations well beyond their specialized areas. We also foster an appreciation for the facets of their lives outside the workplace that enrich and motivate them. All of this creates a surge, every day, of the big ideas and new thinking that continue to drive our growth.
FROM GROWTH , RESPONSIBILIT Y

While social responsibility has a new focus in corporate America, since its founding Alberto Culver has understood its commitment to our communities, shareholders, employees, business partners and consumers. Social responsibility is instilled in our culture from the factory floor to the boardroom and builds from five key foundation blocks: Community, Sustainability, Safety, Compliance and Ethics.

Our Motions brand is the leading salon line in the segment and offers at-home solutions for between salon visits.

Alberto Culver

Beyond the beauty categories, we are proud of our strong-selling, internally developed household brands. Mrs. Dash salt-free seasonings provide a broad range of choices for cooks whose families have special dietary needs or who simply want the health benefits of a lower salt diet. Static Guard continues to be the country's best selling anti static spray.

Understanding that strong communities grow from strong families, we focus our substantial charitable efforts on health care, education and programs that help women and their families find jobs and advance in the workplace. We look for groups that bring innovation to each of these areas and, where possible, involve our employees in the selection of groups to be assisted. We were early participants in a number of programs designed to monitor and reduce the environmental impact of our processes, products and packaging. We are committed to considering our employees' health and safety in the decisions we make. Our new Jonesboro facility was built with a short-term goal of zero landfill waste and we have aggressive goals for all our facilities in this regard. Our Board of Directors has established a formal Code of Ethics for the company. We train to it, monitor it and an important part of our annual survey of employees centers around their evaluation of our adherence to that code. Every year brings new challenges and strong competitive pressures. In good times and in tough times, we have maintained our focus on innovation, on growth and on investing behind our brands. We are proud of both our recent and our long-term accomplishments. This has been possible because of the unwavering support of our employees, suppliers and retail customers. And, of course, you ­ our shareholders ­ continue to give us your support as we grow. All of you have our thanks and our commitment to continue to push for new thinking and growth in the years ahead as we continue to build the beautiful business of beauty.

To continue to win, we have to try to maximize every advantage that our smaller size affords us. We must strive to encourage innovative thinking by recognizing and moving on new ideas fast ­ creativity and innovation must be our competitive edge.
