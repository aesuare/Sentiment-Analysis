Message to Our Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
In 2009, Jarden faced the most dramatic macroeconomic downturn in the world economy since I assumed the Chairman and CEO roles in 2001. We were early in recognizing the challenges ahead and we were proactive in making some very tough choices based on the best long-term interests of both shareholders and employees.
It has long been our belief that market leadership in niche markets, supported by strong brand equity and a focus on operational excellence, is the best model for protecting against downside risk, while maximizing upside potential in the consumer products space. Jarden’s exceptional performance in 2009 proved that our diversified business model is extremely resilient and that we perform like a consumer staples company when times are tough.
Our early, decisive actions were designed to achieve a number of goals beyond controlling overhead costs in a period of uncertainty. First, we wished to minimize workforce reductions and retain our employee talent base, while providing job security. We introduced a hiring freeze as early as June 2008, reduced 401(k) contributions, eliminated salary increases and reduced salaries for senior managers across the Company. For a company that is dedicated to the belief that our best assets go home every night, these initiatives were painful but necessary. Second, we prioritized
the continued funding of investments in new product development and marketing during a period in which our competitors were retreating. Despite economic uncertainty, we actually increased
our investment spending as a percentage of SG&A from 23 percent in 2008 to 25 percent in 2009. These investments aided our third objective, which was to increase shelf space at key retailers or,
in other words, to grow market share in a down market.
What were the results of these actions taken proactively for 2009? Despite double-digit revenue declines in many of our core markets, excluding foreign exchange fluctuations, sales in our three primary business segments declined only one percent for the year, and actually grew organically in the fourth quarter.
“Jarden’s exceptional performance in 2009 proved that our diversified business model is extremely resilient and that we perform like a consumer staples company when times are tough.”
  
Perhaps most satisfying, in 2009 Jarden generated the most cash in its history with over $640 million of cash flow from operations compared to $250 million in 2008, a free cash flow yield of 20 percent. This enabled Jarden to hold over $825 million in cash on hand at year-end and reduce our bank leverage ratio to 2.6 times, well below our 3 times target. Our aggressive approach to inventory management, combined with disciplined cost controls, resulted in adjusted net income increasing from 2008 to 2009. As part of our ongoing commitment to returning value to shareholders, we
also initiated a dividend program in 2009. This step reflected our confidence in the on-going cash generative ability of the Company as well as Jarden’s maturation, as we joined the ranks of the majority of other Fortune 500 consumer products companies in paying dividends.

“We were delighted to complete the purchase of Mapa Spontex in April 2010, our first significant acquisition in more that two and a half years.“
During 2009 our three primary business segments grew market share in spite of the macro headwinds and we believe they are well positioned to grow organically in 2010. We were particularly pleased that Jarden Consumer Solutions was able to show revenue growth for 2009, despite sector declines. This growth was largely driven by the geographic diversification of the business and the successful introduction of new products in a variety of markets. These new product introductions included the Mr. Coffee® Frappe, the Duo and Trio Crock-Pot®, a new energy efficient line of Bionaire® air purifiers and fans and the Oster® Baby Nutrition Center system. Jarden Outdoor Solutions finished the year strongly and is well positioned to grow organically in 2010, with the last of its integration work behind it. Our continued focus on innovation was highlighted with the launch of the first ski binding designed specifically for women under the Marker® brand, an updated line of Coleman® LED flashlights and the next generation of Penn® fishing reels. The highlight for Jarden Branded Consumables was the 125th anniversary celebration for the Ball® food preservation business, culminating in over 15% organic sales growth in 2009. During 2010, our United States Playing Card business will be celebrating the 125th anniversary of the Bicycle® brand. Housed in its brand new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Kentucky
that was officially opened in July 2009, we are hopeful that Bicycle® will have an equally successful anniversary year.
As we enter a new decade, I believe it is noteworthy that Jarden has been among the best performing consumer stocks of the last decade, whether viewed over a one, five or ten-year period. In a period of economic crisis our stock rose 170 percent during 2009 and we have consistently outperformed the majority of our small- and mid-cap consumer products peer group and the S&P 500 based on earnings growth rather than multiple expansion. Our stock price performance over both the short- and long-term speaks volumes about not only the Company’s operating strategy and execution, but of the investing public’s recognition of our success.
We were delighted to complete the purchase of Mapa Spontex in April 2010, our first significant acquisition in more than two and a half years. The Paris-based business is a very Jardenesque company with a portfolio of over 15 prominent international brands led by its NUK® baby care products, Mapa® gloves and Spontex® sponges. We accomplished our stated goal of entering the baby care category as a market leader with the acquisition of the NUK®, Tigex®, and Lillo® global

 brands. The baby care market is a niche, fragmented category and we believe there are numerous product innovation and incremental tuck-in acquisition opportunities to further grow our presence in this sector. In addition, the home care portfolio of Mapa Spontex opens a new front in Jarden’s “in and around the home” product offerings, through the market for household cleaning items. Of equal importance, at less than a 6 times EBITDA acquisition multiple, we believe we have deployed the Company’s capital very efficiently with the potential for healthy cash on cash returns for Jarden.
The difficult global economic conditions, and our disciplined response to it, made 2009 a challenging year for our employees. I am profoundly grateful for their tenacity and determination during these turbulent times. Thanks to their efforts and dedication, Jarden has continued its positive momentum, staff reductions have been minimized and we believe our future has never been filled with more promise.
I look forward to reporting on our progress in 2010 as Jarden is on track to continue to deliver consistent, profitable growth.
Respectfully yours,
Martin E. Franklin
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
