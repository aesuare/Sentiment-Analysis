  Leading the Way
At FedEx, leading the way comes naturally. We originated the modern air/ground express industry. We invented the concept of time-critical expedited delivery. We were the first to use bar code labeling in the ground transportation industry and the first express company to offer time-definite freight service.
And yet, today, FedEx is so much more. More services. More technology. All backed by more than 214,000 employees and contractors who are more focused than ever on meeting customer needs – about five million times a day.
As today’s FedEx, we’re proud to be one of the world’s most admired companies. We’re proud to be recognized as a great place to work. Most of all, we’re proud to continue leading the way for our customers, our investors, our employees and our communities.

 “At FedEx, we pride ourselves on being agile in the marketplace, anticipating opportunities and capitalizing on the unexpected.”
LETTER FROM THE CEO
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
This past fiscal year, a weakened economy, 9/11 and other unsettling world events made everyone in boardrooms to shopping aisles more cautious of what lay ahead.
However, whether the economy is up or down, at FedEx we pride ourselves on being agile in the marketplace, anticipating opportuni- ties and capitalizing on the unexpected. The reason we can flex with changing market conditions is that we are grounded in a solid strategy – “operate independently, compete collectively.” It has been a compass for our decision-making and has distinguished us from the competition.
The new strategy we have put in place over the past several years has made us a full-service transportation company, offering the broadest array of services. With FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight, FedEx Custom Critical and FedEx Trade Networks, we can offer our customers an unprecedented array of shipping and supply chain serv- ices quickly and conveniently across the globe.
Thanks to the diversification of our business, we can now give customers more options, shift resources as markets dictate and keep more business within the FedEx family of companies.
Delivering Financial Results
In FY02, we executed well according to our plan and, despite a sluggish economy, we came through with the flying colors of all our operat- ing companies. FedEx Corporation delivered a solid financial performance while growing revenues, managing costs and balancing resources.
- Annual revenue increased 5% to a record $20.6 billion.
- Net income increased 22% to a record $710 million.
- And diluted earnings per share increased 18% to a record $2.34.
In addition, we produced $616 million in free cash flow – a significant milestone for our company
And, for the first time in our history, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share on our common stock. This dividend reflects our confidence in the company’s future and in its unique role in the global economy.
We have taken significant steps to reduce overhead, increase productivity and tightly focus our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts, combined with an improving economy, should position us to increase revenue, profitability and return on invested capital and to gen- erate positive free cash flow in the 2003 fiscal year.
Leading the Way with Unmatched Service Options
In FY02, we knew we had to retool during a sagging economy in order to soar when it recovered. We examined each of our businesses to either expand service offerings and networks to meet higher demand or to scale back through cost-reduction measures.
With softer demand for high-tech and high-value-added goods, FedEx Express, which primarily serves those sectors, faced the biggest challenge. By containing costs and matching resources to lower business volumes while keeping service levels high, FedEx Express performed well in a tough market environment. The implementation of our landmark agreement with the United States Postal Service last summer also forti- fied our FedEx Express business. And our unsurpassed FedEx Express global network remains ready to exploit a reviving global economy.
FedEx Ground experienced outstanding growth, growing year over year by double digits. FedEx Ground reached two million packages a day in November 2001, due mainly to an expanded network, improved service levels, improved sales capabilities, especially for small- and medium-sized customers, and the power of the FedEx brand.

  “Our goal is to deliver the perfect customer experience every time – one that’s seamless, convenient and efficient.”
FedEx Home Delivery expanded to serve 90% of the U.S. residential mar- ket and will reach virtually 100% in September 2002.
FedEx Freight continued to make competitive gains despite a slow economy, and now offers the best service in the regional less-than- truckload transportation sector. The decision to rebrand Viking Freight and American Freightways as FedEx Freight and to offer additional serv- ice options will solidify its position as the largest carrier in its segment.
Leading the Way with Cutting-Edge Technology
Technology “talks,” and FedEx technology helps customers listen. Why? Because it winnows out the clutter and delivers, quickly and conveniently, the information customers need to manage their inventory in motion. As we’ve always said at FedEx, information about the shipment is as important as the shipment itself, and this simple philosophy continues to press us toward even more innovative customer technology.
In FY02, we announced next-generation wireless technology to boost pickup and delivery efficiency and to give customers another convenient way to access FedEx information. We launched FedEx InSight to give our customers unparalleled information about their FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments, whether inbound or outbound. And our Web site, fedex.com, continued to be recognized as one of the best, most convenient business Web sites, winning such honors as Best Transportation Web Site and the number-two spot on eWeek magazine‘s annual list of leading e-business innovators.
Leading the Industry and the Community
Despite a challenging economy, FedEx received a record number of accolades – ten in all, including Fortune magazine’s Top 10 World’s Most Admired Companies, and Harris Interactive & Reputation Institute Top 10. Another important honor was United Way of America recognizing FedEx
Corporation and its subsidiaries with four Summit Awards, which honor businesses committed to building better communities. As always, our employees were instrumental in our receiving these awards through their beyond-the-call-of-duty performances at work and in our communities.
Leading the Way Ahead
We have honed our core strategy of “operate independently, compete collectively” to the point that all our operating companies are finely calibrated to the segments they serve. In FY03, we will focus more on perfecting the “compete collectively” side of our strategic equation by improving the customer experience at every point of contact.
Our goal is to deliver the perfect customer experience every time – one that’s seamless, convenient and efficient. In FY03, we will work toward refining numerous processes affecting the customer. By making these systems “customer-simple,” we intend to increase cus- tomer loyalty and corporate revenue.
We are confident in our strategy and people, and are poised for economic recovery. Our market opportunities are very large, and we look confidently and optimistically towards improving results in FY03 and beyond.
Sincerely,
Frederick W. Smith
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
