Bonnell responded to continued economic pressure and maintained positive EBITDA by continuing to reduce its break even point and setting a new record low in working capital as a percentage of sales. As a result, Tredegar's net cash flow from operating and investing activities was $71.5 million in 2009. All of these accomplishments are reflected in Tredegar's strong balance sheet and cash position(1.3) at the end of 2009.

Bonnell operates in an industry with a dismal safety (21.6) record. So by industry standards Bonnell's safety performance has been (33.8) good. But Bonnell recognized that what may have been good for the industry wasn't good enough for its employees. So it is setting its own

In 2009, its recordable incident rate improved Bonnell Aluminum Safety Performance by 26% and its lost time accident rate was lower compared to 2008. Total Recordable Incident Rate Film Products' safety record slipped in 2009 after achieving a world class 11.3 10.5 performance in 2008, but continued to be significantly better than its 9.6 9.5 industry average.

Leadership has never been more important. Tredegar has strong leaders. The Bonnell, Film Products and Corporate management teams are as good as I have seen during my 18 years at Tredegar. And the alignment within and among the teams couldn't be better. This isn't something that happens overnight, and it sure couldn't be in place at a better time. Our leaders made tough decisions swiftly in response to the economic crisis and, as decisions were being made, there was a continual balancing of the urgent need to address near-term challenges against furthering of the business strategies for longer-term growth. Just as important, our leaders led in a way that rallied the whole of their organizations to persevere and sacrifice for the good of the business.

Leadership means industry leadership as well. Film Products and Bonnell have repeatedly demonstrated leadership in their industries. In 2009, Bonnell introduced acid-etched anodizing, a more environmentally friendly anodizing process. Due to Bonnell's efforts to educate its industry, acid-etched anodizing has gained significant traction. Film Products continues to be recognized around the world for product leadership in our markets, as well as for setting the quality standard in protective films for the LCD market. Innovation is a powerful building block for growth. The words "innovation" and "technology" are closely linked. Technology and product innovation have contributed significantly to Film Products' past success and remain at the center of its strategy. We value Innovation beyond its application to technology. Innovation breaks the paradigms of a plant, a business and an industry. It explains Bonnell's ability to differentiate itself in a com modity market. It's the "Aha" in Film Products that triggers a process change that lowers the energy consumption of a line while improving the end product.

Innovation

We have made great progress in Operational Excellence, Leadership and Innovation, but we still have work to do. So when do these building blocks produce growth for Tredegar? It's pretty clear that Bonnell's turnaround is tied to a sustained recovery in the non-residential construction market. The timing of that recovery is unclear, but it is not expected to occur during 2010. Bonnell will continue to battle an extremely tough economic environment and, as it does, its Operational Excellence, Leadership and Innovation will improve. In Film Products, we expect spending to increase for a number of new product initiatives that should prove to be meaningful contributors within the next few years. As Film Products continues to improve its Operational Excellence, Leadership and Innovation, productivity improvements and cost reductions should offset a portion of the higher spending. By focusing on our building blocks, we have also opened up another avenue for growth through business development. We are actively looking for external opportunities where our Operational Excellence, Leadership and Innovation skills and knowledge can create value. Rest assured, our approach to business development is disciplined and centers on leveraging existing Tredegar competencies while maintaining a strong balance sheet. To Tredegar's employees, thank you for your passion, commitment and many sacrifices--Tredegar's accomplishments are your accomplishments. To Tredegar's Board of Directors, I appreciate the trust you have placed in me. I am so grateful for the time and wisdom you continue to provide to me and the rest of Tredegar's management team on behalf of Tredegar's shareholders. To Tredegar's customers, thank you for your continued busi ness. We strive every day to support your success and create value for you and your customers. We at Tredegar believe we are building a winning formula based on Operational Excellence, Leadership and Innovation and that you, our shareholders, will see the results as the economy recovers in the markets that we serve. I appreciate your willingness to share that belief.

Two Very Special Thank Yous
On March 3rd, Tom Slater graciously submitted his resignation from Tredegar's Board of Directors so that I could join the Board. Tom has served on our Board since 1998 with great enthusiasm and attention. Tredegar's Board and management have benefited from his perspective and experience. Tom, we thank you for your service and wise counsel. John Gottwald retired as President and Chief Executive Officer of Tredegar on January 31st. On that day, he also retired as an employee with over 30 years of service with Tredegar and Ethyl Corporation. It is impossible to summarize in a few words what John has meant to Tredegar. He had been the driving force behind Tredegar since its birth as an independent public company in July, 1989. Under John's leadership, Tredegar created significant shareholder value. He taught many of us at Tredegar the importance of distinguishing tactics from strategy. He honed our critical thinking skills. He amazed us with his ability to zero in on the heart of the matter. He delighted us when we received one of his discerning pats on the back. And, EVERY SINGLE DAY, he challenged us to be better. Tredegar celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009. John marked the occasion in a way that only he could, by regaling the employees with a deep and lively history lesson on Tredegar and its heritage. The effort put forth to create this masterpiece was enormous, and the finished product is a treasure that will inspire generations of Tredegar employees to come. John will remain on Tredegar's Board and no doubt he will continue to challenge us to be better. Still, we will miss our daily nudge and all the wonderful things that came with it.

Nancy M. Taylor President and Chief Executive Officer
