Rising to the Challenge
Dear Fellow Shareholders:
In 2005 Allstate experienced the worst hurricane season on record—and the costliest in your company’s 75-year history. We sent 4,100 catastrophe specialists to ravaged areas to do what
we do best: help customers recover. We also refined
our risk management
models and continued to
execute our strategy to produce profitable growth. By focusing on our strengths, we fulfilled our commitments to policy holders, invested in growth and rewarded our shareholders.
Record Revenues, Lower Earnings

Chief Executive Officer
Although Allstate gen- erated record revenues in 2005, we incurred an unprecedented $5.7 billion in catastrophe- related costs as we helped customers rebuild their lives. That’s a big number— more than five times our annual average over the last decade. Return on equity fell 6.6 points for 2005, compared to an increase of 0.8 points in 2004. Operating income per diluted share* declined from $4.41 in 2004 to $2.37 in 2005.
Property-Liability continued to benefit from our focus on profitable growth. Premiums written increased by 3.2 percent from $26.5 billion in 2004 to $27.4 billion in 2005. Our Allstate brand standard auto business produced 2.9 percent unit growth, while Allstate home- owners achieved 3.4 percent unit growth.
Financial premiums and deposits* were $14.4 billion, and its operating income increased by 5.4 percent to $581 million. Overall, we’re making progress in Allstate Financial and remain focused on improving returns that will deliver profitable growth.
Amid a historic year
in catastrophes, our businesses once again rewarded Allstate share- holders. We repurchased $2.5 billion of our

term momentum,

to regulatory approvals. This arrangement will allow our distribution channels to continue to offer a full range of prod- ucts, including variable annuities, while we dedicate our resources to better deploy capital to a more focused product portfolio where we have scale and a significant market presence today.
Under the circum- stances, we’re very proud of these results. They show that our strategy is working, and that the market remains confident we can deliver the attractive, steady long-term returns shareholders expect.
Total Property- Liability revenues, including investment income, increased by 3.5 percent to a record $29.3 billion. And, excluding catastrophes, that top-line growth was generated while continuing to improve our underwriting margins. Our Property- Liability combined ratio, excluding catas- trophes*, improved

Our stock price closed 2005 at $54.07, a 4.5 percent increase from the $51.72 at the end of 2004. We also delivered a total shareholder return of 7 percent. And, we maintained our solid credit ratings from major rating agencies.

Re-examining Risk
Finding New Opportunities

for named storms, earthquakes and fires following earthquakes in all states except Florida. We also pur- chased as additional protection from hurri- canes in Florida $900 million of reinsurance in excess of amounts recov- erable from the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. In some other states, we’re purchasing more reinsurance to reduce our exposures.
Though we can’t control the weather, we can

By staying close to our customers and markets, we’re growing our customer base in a highly competitive market. We compete aggressively for high lifetime value insurance customers in multi-line households. But it takes more than price to win. To attract and retain profitable customers, we also continue to develop our product mix to meet their needs and back these products with fast response, financial strength and integrity. In addition, we anticipate and respond to demo- graphic, regulatory and market trends to find
new ways to connect with consumers. For example, over the last five years we’ve doubled our investment in multi- cultural advertising. We’re also aggressively tapping such channels as NASCAR, Olympic and college football sponsorships and placing greater emphasis on cable TV, the Internet and customer- experience activities.
First, why were Allstate’s losses so significant in Louisiana and Mississippi? Katrina’s wide path and unusual severity meant high payouts

we insure there.
Second, what will
we do in the future to mitigate this risk so we can continue to generate reliable earnings growth and increase our returns on capital? Each major storm teaches us new lessons—and makes us better able to manage risks. We factor new data into our risk management strategy, including recent find- ings that point to a period of more frequent and severe hurricanes. We purchased country- wide reinsurance that will reimburse Allstate for $2 billion of losses in excess of $2 billion
In other markets, we’re increasing rates and deductibles on our homeowners policies and limiting new business writing.
In markets where we cannot adequately cover our risks, we may be able to help customers find alternative coverage while we focus instead on auto and financial services products.
Moreover, we’re calling for public policy change and a more rational approach to how Americans prepare for and protect them- selves against the devastating and highly unpredictable effects of catastrophes.
Reinsurance could have softened the blow, as it did in Texas, for Hurricane Rita. When we considered our expo- sures on an enterprise-

           The Future: Building on our Strengths
Innovation at Work
Value Driven
Investing in People
Innovation anchors suc- cess for any company that wants to survive and thrive over the long-term. Allstate is no exception. Our success reflects our commit- ment to product and process innovation and efficient business prac- tices, and we have many industry firsts to our credit.
Specifically, we started to apply even more sophisticated tiered pricing not only to auto, but across our home- owners portfolio to more finely segment risks and help attract customers with higher lifetime value. And, our Next Generation Claim Systems will combine new technologies with fast, simple, customer- focused processes. This investment will help us lower our loss adjust- ment expenses, better manage loss costs and boost customer reten- tion and satisfaction.
Value means different things to different people. For Allstate,
it means doing everything we can to optimize financial returns for shareholders. The 2005 hurricane season reinforced the importance of manag- ing our business with even greater precision and sophistication.

We provide our force of nearly 70,000 employees, agents and agency staff with many opportuni- ties to expand their knowledge, acquire new skills and position themselves for new career and business opportunities.
