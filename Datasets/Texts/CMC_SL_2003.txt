To our stockholders
Fiscal 2003: It was an off-year, but our diversification enabled us to meet the challenges, and our fourth quarter was much stronger.

For the year ended August 31, 2003, your Company reported net earnings of $18.9 million or $0.66 per diluted share on net sales of $2.9 billion. This compares with net earnings of $40.5 million or $1.43 per diluted share on net sales of $2.5 billion for the year ended August 31, 2002. This year's results included a LIFO expense of $6.1 million, or $0.21 cents per diluted share, compared with a $1.0 million expense, or $0.04 per diluted share, last year. Fourth quarter net earnings were $10.7 million or $0.38 per diluted share on net sales of $805 million, compared with net earnings of $9.0 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of $682 million in the fourth quarter of 2002. The best news is that the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 was the strongest quarter of the year, by far. Throughout much of the year many of our key markets ­ particularly those for our Manufacturing segment ­ remained under pressure, although we did see improvement as the year progressed. While public construction and institutional building held up relatively well, commercial construction in the United States was off sharply for the second consecutive year which continued to impact our downstream businesses as well as our mills. Additionally, business spending and the industrial side of the economy remained soft. Similarly, many of the global markets remained weak. There were exceptions for us, China and Australia being two notable examples. And during the second half of the fiscal year we began to see some pickup in demand. We also began to see some of the expected net benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar. Specifically, results in our Manufacturing segment were well below par; conversely, it was a banner year for our Recycling and Marketing and Distribution segments. For the fourth quarter, comparative results were as follows:

Manufacturing segment hurt by margin squeezes.

Net sales in Manufacturing were $1.34 billion for the year ended August 31, 2003, 2% lower than the prior year. Earnings before income taxes were $20.0 million compared with $70.8 million the year before. However, fourth quarter earnings before income taxes of $13.1 million represented the best quarter of fiscal 2003. Steel mill price realizations were at extremely low levels for much of the year, while the increase in input costs (scrap/supplies/utilities) outpaced the improvements in selling prices which occurred later in the year. Tons melted decreased 1%, while tons rolled decreased 3%. Shipments, however, increased 5% to 2.3 million tons, although the increase was accounted for mainly by higher billet shipments. Our average total mill selling price increased $9.50 per ton; however, the average scrap purchase price rose much faster at $17 per ton. The fourth quarter to fourth quarter average selling price and shipments for the mills were up 8% and 4%, respectively. The average total mill selling price rose 3% above the third quarter of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2003 year-to-date utility costs resulted in a significant increase compared with fiscal 2002, namely $9.4 million higher. The large jump was primarily in the natural gas cost. The fourth quarter increase was $2.7 million. Our steel fabrication and related businesses were slightly profitable versus a solid earnings before income taxes in the year earlier. Our average fabricated selling price dropped $72 per ton. Shipments from our fab plants totaled 1.0 million tons, 4.5% more than the prior year. Fabricated rebar shipments were up significantly; however, other categories were mostly lower. Rebar fabrication, constructionrelated products, steel fence post plants and heat treating reported solid profits, but joists and structural steel fabrication recorded losses, primarily due to depressed selling prices. Additionally, fiscal 2002 included a pre-tax gain of $5.2 million on the sale of SMI-Owen Steel Company, as well as their higher profits preceding the sale. Consolidation of administrative functions continued. Several acquisitions were consummated during fiscal 2003 in rebar fabrication and construction-related products as we broadened our geographic presence and market coverage. Fourth quarter comparisons showed higher shipments because of an increase in fabricated rebar tonnage, but a significant decrease in the average fabricated price. However, the average selling price was above the third quarter. The Copper Tube division reported only a modest profit for the year ended August 31, 2003 compared with earnings before income taxes of $5.1 million the previous year as net sales decreased 2%, and we also experienced a margin squeeze in this business. Although residential construction held up relatively well, other market sectors were significantly weaker. The average selling price of plumbing tube and refrigeration tube was down over 7 cents per pound, whereas average copper scrap prices increased by over 4 cents per pound. Metal spreads were correspondingly lower. Our copper tube shipments

increased 4% compared with the previous fiscal year. Production and shipments were up in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, but the average sales price decreased compared with the prior year's quarter. The average sales price, however, was higher than the third quarter.
Recycling: Best year since 1988 .

All four of our geographic regions performed excellently. Net sales dollars for 2003 increased 17% to $441 million, led by a surge in steel scrap prices. Coupled with good cost controls, gross margins jumped 24% and earnings before income taxes nearly tripled last year to $15.1 million. This was after a pre-tax LIFO expense of $1.3 million. Nonferrous markets improved moderately year over year. Versus last year, the average ferrous scrap sales price rose by $19 per short ton to $100 per short ton and shipments were 10% higher at 1.64 million short tons. The average nonferrous scrap sales price increased 8% compared with a year ago while nonferrous shipments declined 3%. Earnings before income taxes for the fourth quarter were $4.7 million, featured by an average ferrous selling price of $105 per ton. Total volume of scrap processed, including our CMC Steel Group processing operations, equaled 2.81 million tons against 2.57 million tons last year.
An outstanding year for the Marketing and Distribution segment.

Earnings before income taxes for this segment were $20.3 million for the year ended August 31, 2003, compared with $11.9 million the prior year. Net sales leaped 48% to $1.15 billion in 2003, with the predominant increase outside the U.S. During the year, international steel prices for flat-rolled products rose for several quarters and then weakened, mainly because of a pullback in China, but then began to increase again during the fourth quarter. Prices for long products rose much more slowly. Our steel volume increased, other than for imports into the U.S. Our business in the U.S. reflected the sub-par economy, weaker U.S. dollar and import duties. Influenced by similar factors, nonferrous semis were weaker with respect to volume, price and margins. However, sales and margins for ores, minerals, ferroalloys and special metals were generally higher. As previously mentioned, better demand in several of our key markets, including that for processed material, contributed to the overall improved results. Our service centers in Australia continued to perform well, and our relatively new joint venture Europickling facility in Belgium reached record output levels and became profitable. Meanwhile, the joint venture arrangements with our 11% investee Trinecke Zelezarny are going well. On July 22, 2003, we announced that a subsidiary had entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a controlling interest in Huta Zawiercie, a Polish steel minimill (the purchase is subject to the approval of various Polish regulatory agencies and satisfaction of certain conditions, and we anticipate closing by December 15, 2003). Rising freight rates were an issue as the year progressed. The implementation of new information

systems continued to be a burden at several of our divisions, but will enhance significantly our systems capability when the conversion is finished early in fiscal 2004. Fourth quarter earnings before income taxes was a solid $6.7 million, 13% above fiscal 2002's very strong fourth quarter.
Capital investment will be up because of the Polish mill acquisition.

Capital spending in fiscal 2003 totaled $63 million including acquisitions. The capital budget for fiscal 2004 is $61 million excluding the $50 million acquisition cost of the 71.1% of the shares of Huta Zawiercie. Expenditures are spread across the segments with the bulk in steel manufacturing.
Our financial position remained strong.

At the end of 2003, our stockholders' equity was $507 million or $18.11 per share. Year-end net working capital was $399 million and the current ratio 1.9. Our EBITDA to interest coverage remained strong. Long-term debt as a percentage of total capitalization was 31.6%, and the ratio of total debt to total capitalization plus short-term debt stood at 32.9%. During the year we repurchased 951,410 shares of CMC stock at an average price of $15.36 per share. For the year we paid quarterly cash dividends totaling $0.32 cents per share on common stock, including our 155th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. On August 8, 2003, we signed a new three year revolving credit agreement for $275 million with a group of sixteen banks. As with previous agreements, the principal function of this agreement is to back up our commercial paper program. Subsequent to year end, on November 12, 2003, we closed a successful ten year, $200 million 5.625% bond offering. The proceeds funded the retirement of $89 million of our $100 million of bonds otherwise due in 2005, the anticipated purchase of the shares of Huta Zawiercie, and other general corporate uses.
The outlook is better!

We expect fiscal 2004 to be significantly better than fiscal 2003, due both to internal measures that we have taken to reduce costs and increase productivity, as well as better economic conditions this fiscal year amid increasing signs of a recovery, most apparent for global manufacturing. In the U.S. especially, we are seeing increasing signs of the pickup in the manufacturing sector and pockets of improvement in construction, although office, lodging and industrial construction will be slower to recover. Additionally, capital goods orders are higher. Asia is relatively strong and Europe is showing signs of pulling out of its slump, albeit inconsistently. We anticipate better performance in our Manufacturing segment via improved metal spreads and increases in production, shipments and prices. We have implemented several steel mill product price

increases on most of our products; the cumulative announced price increases are $70 per ton for merchant bar and $55 per ton for reinforcing bar. These increases should become fully effective during the first half of fiscal 2004 and help restore margins for our steel mills. We expect margins in several of our downstream businesses to be compressed earlier in the year followed by an expansion of margins. Strong demand for steel scrap and nonferrous metal scrap combined with the relatively weak U.S. dollar will lend support to our Recycling segment. Marketing and Distribution profits are expected to remain very good, better than last year in the U.S. divisions but not quite as strong in the International divisions. Prices generally should be firm with good volume. We anticipate that overall results will be better in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half.
Future prospects are good!

We remain well positioned, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. Long term, we expect stronger demand, including the increased possibility of a recovery in demand throughout the major economic blocs and continued growth in developing countries. Emerging countries often exhibit a higher growth rate for steel and nonferrous metals consumption. The supply/demand equation is shifting toward Asia ­ especially China ­ as well as Central and Eastern Europe. As an example, China now consumes about one quarter of the world's steel and produces nearly one quarter of global crude steel output. Although China appears to be expanding its steel production too quickly, some analysts maintain that China's growth will cause a positive inflection in steel and nonferrous metals demand on a global basis, even though all expect a correction during the next several years. Meanwhile, our approach remains to get closer to our customers in the supply chain wherever they are located.
