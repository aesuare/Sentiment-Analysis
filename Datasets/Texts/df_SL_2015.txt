                   Dear Fellow Stockholders:
2015 was a year of substantial success and accomplishments and I’m excited to share with
you our progress from the past year. We exited the year with great financial results and entered 2016 with significant momentum. It was a year where we accomplished several of our previous goals and we continue to sharpen our focus.
 Financially, 2015 was a year of opportunity.
• We experienced significant improvement in our P&L.
• We improved our liquidity, extended debt maturities and increased flexibility with modified debt facilities providing up to $1 billion in liquidity.
• We fortified our balance sheet with total leverage declining over two full turns in 2015 to 1.89 net debt to EBITDA.
• We returned approximately $79 million in cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
• We generated strong free cash flow of approximately $246 million.
• We invested approximately $163 million in our business through capital expenditures.
DairyPure® was the big news of the year. The April 2015 launch of our national white milk brand is off to a great start. Consumers are telling us they’re asking for DairyPure by name and that the 5 Point Purity PromiseTM
is important to them when making their choice for their family’s milk. We expect great things from DairyPure and are looking forward to sharing more news with you next year.
  Expansion of the DairyPure brand
With the successful launch of DairyPure, one national brand endorsed by our local brands, Dean Foods is embarking on the expansion of DairyPure products:
• School milk has transitioned to DairyPure, allowing our youngest consumers to have the daily opportunity to drink our milk at school.
• DairyPure Lactose Free milk is now available at large retailers throughout the country.
• DairyPure creams now come in new packaging and are available nationwide in both retail and foodservice channels.
     
                TruMoo continues togrow
TruMoo is America’s favorite flavored milk brand. In addition to chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, limited-time offers prove to be popular. With the introduction of TruMoo Calcium Plus, we are adding more nutritional benefit to flavored milk. Also, TruMoo’s expansion into protein drinks continues our focus on healthy indulgences while providing a nutritious drink for people needing an extra boost of protein in their diets.
   TruMoo® continues to grow and expand, maintaining its position as the No. 1 flavored milk
in the country. Limited-time-offer flavors such as Chocolate Marshmallow and Orange Scream are seasonal favorites. In 2015 we asked consumers what new flavor they’d like to see in 2016 and they chose Cookies n’ Cream, which will launch this year. TruMoo also houses our protein drinks, making it
a powerhouse brand.
DairyPure and TruMoo were just two areas of focus in 2015. We also increased our productivity and improved operational efficiencies by eliminating waste in our system and acting on opportunities to leverage our scale and purchasing power.
As we move into 2016, we continue to focus
on efforts to enhance future capabilities, drive operational excellence, transform how we go to market, strengthen our private label business, and build and buy strong brands. See the next page for more details on what our focus will mean for 2016 and beyond.
We expect 2016 to be a year where our operating and financial momentum continues. Dean Foods continues to provide one-third of the national fluid milk volume and our top brands hold the
No. 1 and No. 2 spots in their categories in 80% of the markets where we compete. Milk can be found in 89.9% of U.S. homes and the category has been showing signs of recovery compared to the declines in prior years as consumers again recognize the great nutrition and health benefits of dairy.
With the extension of the DairyPure and TruMoo brands, along with a focus on what consumers are looking for in their dairy products, we feel Dean Foods is well-positioned to take advantage of changing trends in the market.
We’re looking forward to the opportunities 2016 has in store for us. I would be regretful if I did not recognize our approximately 17,000 employees for making Dean Foods better today than it was yesterday. Together we continue to strive to be the most admired and trusted provider of wholesome, great-tasting dairy products at every occasion.
And thank you, our stockholders, for your continued support and confidence in us going forward.
Sincerely,
