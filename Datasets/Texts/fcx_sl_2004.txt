 Making Progress
To Our Shareholders
We successfully addressed significant operating challenges for our Company in 2004, and by year’s end we positioned our operations for strong performance in 2005 and beyond. Following the Grasberg open-pit wall slippage events in the fourth quarter of 2003, our first priority has been assuring the safety of our workforce. We also took steps to provide for the long-term stability of the Grasberg’s pit walls. While the management decision to take these prudent actions caused us to produce lower volumes of copper and gold during 2004, they positioned our operations for strong future results. We achieved our goal of establishing safe access to our high-grade ore areas and production ramped up throughout 2004. By the fourth quarter of 2004, we were mining high-grade material in the lower areas of the Grasberg mine and achieving strong financial results. Our outlook for 2005 is highly positive, both from an operating and a market perspective.
Most important to our operating outlook is the signifi- cant progress we made in 2004 in our safety performance, including new and enhanced workforce programs, renewed and expanded management emphasis, the stabilizing work
in the Grasberg pit and additional state-of-the-art equip- ment. Our lost-time injury rate per 200,000 hours worked at PT Freeport Indonesia for 2004 was 0.15 — a 56 percent improvement over 2003 — compared to the U.S. metallic mining industry average rate of 2.10 for 2003 (the latest year available); and our total reportable rate (all reportable injuries) for 2004 was 0.44 — a 32 percent improvement over 2003 — compared to the U.S. average of 3.39 in 2003. While these results are positive, the focus of our organization will be to improve our safety performance continually.
Total sales for PT Freeport Indonesia, our Indonesian mining affiliate, for 2004 were 1.0 billion pounds of copper and 1.44 million ounces of gold. Restoring safe access to our high-grade ore is expected to provide substan- tially greater sales for 2005 — 1.5 billion pounds of copper (50 percent more than 2004) and 2.9 million ounces of
gold (100 percent more than 2004) net to PT Freeport Indonesia’s interest.
The markets for both of our metals were strong in 2004, and the outlook for continued near-term strength is positive. Our average realized price per pound of copper for 2004 was $1.37, a $0.55 increase from 2003. Our average

realized price per ounce of gold was $412, a $45 increase from 2003. Despite lower sales volumes, we generated
net income for 2004 of $156.8 million, $0.85 per share, compared to $154.2 million, $0.97 per share in 2003.
We anticipate strong financial performance in 2005. At annual average metals prices of $1.35 per pound for copper and $420 per ounce for gold, our anticipated 2005 sales
of copper and gold would be expected to provide operating cash flows in excess of $1.1 billion, more than triple our 2004 cash flows.
Because the Grasberg mine and its supporting infrastruc- ture have been fully developed in past years, capital expen- ditures in recent years have been limited. In 2004, capital expenditures totaled $141 million. We expect capital expen- ditures to total approximately $180 million in 2005 and to average approximately $145 million annually for the next five years. These expenditures include costs to maintain our productive capacity, to continue to expand our underground operations at our high-grade Deep Ore Zone underground mine and to pursue the development of our underground infrastructure for the long-term production of our signifi- cant underground reserves that are currently undeveloped. With our expected strong cash flows from operations in 2005 and subsequent years, the relatively low level of capi- tal expenditures enables us to pursue a financial strategy of continuing to improve our balance sheet while providing returns to shareholders through dividends and purchases of our common shares.
In recent years, we have aggressively reduced our Company’s debt and lengthened the maturities of our remaining obligations. Over the past five years, we have reduced our debt by $966 million and our debt net of unre- stricted cash by $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2004, our gross debt was $1.95 billion. Our net debt now totals $1.4 billion, including $575 million of our 7% convertible notes which have a conversion price of $30.87 per share signifi- cantly below the current market price of our common stock. We have relatively low amounts of debt maturing in the

near term, $78.2 million in 2005 and an annual average of approximately $104 million for the next five years. We con- tinue to explore alternatives to reduce debt in advance of the required maturities.
Our Board reinstated annual dividends on our common stock in February 2003 at $0.36 per share, after several years when no dividends were paid. In October 2003, the regular annual common dividend was increased to $0.80 per share and again increased to $1.00 per share in October 2004. In addition, our Board declared incremental special dividends of $0.25 per share paid in December 2004 and $0.50 per share to be paid in March 2005. During 2004, we purchased 3.4 million shares of our common stock for $99.5 million under the 20 million share open market common share purchase program authorized by our Board. During March 2004, we also purchased 23.9 million shares of our common stock previously owned by our ongoing joint ven- ture partner, Rio Tinto plc, for $881.9 million. The purchase was funded by the issuance of $1.1 billion of 51⁄2% convertible perpetual preferred stock.
Entering 2005 with $552 million of cash and an outlook for strong operations, commodity prices and cash flows, we are enthusiastic about the future prospects for our Company. We are focused on executing our business strategy effec- tively while pursuing a financial strategy of continuing to reduce debt and enhance our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share purchases.
Through our active exploration efforts in the immediate vicinity of the Grasberg mine, we continue to add significantly to our proven and probable reserves, extending the productive life of our operations. Since its discovery in 1988, the Grasberg district has already produced 16.1 billion pounds of copper and 23.3 million ounces of gold net to
PT Freeport Indonesia. As we enter 2005, the district contains proven and probable reserves sufficient to allow us to mine for decades to come — more than 40 billion pounds of copper and more than 46 million ounces of gold net to PT Freeport Indonesia.
We are enthusiastic about our future exploration oppor- tunities outside the Grasberg district. After conducting field exploration in the 1990s, we suspended activities. Conditions are improving and we look forward to exploring this highly prospective area. The Grasberg is the only produc-
ing mine in the Indonesian province of Papua. We have significant exploration rights and data throughout the mountainous area of the province and believe this will be important to our Company in the future.
Following our acquisition of Rio Tinto’s common shares in Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., R. Leigh Clifford, Director and Chief Executive of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, and Oscar Y. L. Groeneveld, Chief Executive of the Rio Tinto Copper Group and a director of Rio Tinto plc and Rio Tinto Limited, resigned from our Board of Directors in 2004. We appreciate the many years of service and guidance provided by Messrs. Clifford and Groeneveld during their terms on our Board. Our Board of Directors has nominated each of our Advisory Directors, Gabrielle K. McDonald and J. Stapleton Roy, to stand for election at the Company’s 2005 annual meeting of stockholders.
We want to offer our deepest appreciation to our employees and management team, whose hard work and keen focus made 2004 a successful year of progress for our Company, positioning us to continue to provide long-term values for our shareholders. We also wish to express our gratitude to our Board of Directors, which continues to provide excellent guidance and counsel. Our employees, management and Board of Directors have made possible a future of strong operating and financial results for our Company. Like the Grasberg ore body we mine, they are fine examples of “Making the Grade.”
Respectfully yours,
