Fellow Shareowners: I am pleased to report that we have made substantial progress in this first year of our three-year Transformation Plan. The plan is designed to rebuild long-term shareowner wealth by re-energizing our brands and our people. It is the most comprehensive renewal effort in the 133-year history of Campbell Soup Company. As I explained in my first letter as CEO last year, this plan requires significant investment to build a sustainable growth profile.
In 2002, sales grew 6 percent to $6.1 billion, while net earnings declined 18 percent to $539 million, or $1.31 per share, excluding the costs associated with the Australian manufacturing reconfiguration. This reduction was driven by our decision to substantially increase our investment in marketing to reinvigorate our brands and in infrastructure to rebuild our company. Encouragingly, we made progress toward that goal on multiple fronts:
·

We began to improve the quality of many of our market-leading products, notably in U.S. Soup, by leveraging improved consumer understanding and technical capabilities. We dramatically increased marketing investments to highly competitive levels for many of our core brands, resulting in solid volume growth. We ramped up our productivity profile, leveraging fresh thinking, new tools and techniques, and plenty of old-fashioned hard work. We added depth and breadth to our new product pipelines around the world, and we announced two acquisitions to strengthen our international growth prospects. We further strengthened our global leadership team to ensure both short-term and long-term success.

In short, we did what we said we would do. However, we are far from satisfied. We can and will do better. 1. Revitalize U.S. Soup. Our highest priority is to revitalize our core U.S. Soup business. We have set in motion a comprehensive program to upgrade product quality, substantially increase marketing investment, accelerate product innovation, and improve sales execution. This program delivered a healthy 9 percent increase in our ready-to-serve soup portfolio, and we expect this momentum to continue. Our condensed soup portfolio declined 5 percent. We expect improved performance on condensed in fiscal 2003 and 2004, as we introduce significant product improvements and more convenient easy-to-open packaging.

"Change is well underway at Campbell. We are pleased with the first year of this change, but we still have much more to do to resume our winning ways ... and we will."

Toward year end, we took a major step in delivering breakthrough soup forms by beginning the national launch of Campbell's Soup at Hand, the first sippable soup in its own microwaveable container in the U.S. 2. Strengthen the Broader Portfolio. Beyond U.S. Soup, we have a strong portfolio of brands in growing categories and focused geographies that has responded positively to the increased resources in marketing and infrastructure. We advanced our new North America Sauces and Beverages Division with a dedicated leadership team. Three of the division's core brands ­ V8 vegetable juice, Pace Mexican sauces and Prego sauces ­ have delivered strong growth. Our Biscuits and Confectionery businesses also responded to increased support. Pepperidge Farm and Arnotts delivered strong sales growth and gains in market share across many key segments. Even our Godiva business, which was adversely impacted by the events of September 11 and a slowing U.S. economy, delivered improved sales performance as we continued to invest in new stores around the world. We delivered solid sales growth in our Canadian, Mexican and Latin American operations. 3. Begin to Build New Growth Avenues. Over the past year, we completed the integration of the European dry soup and sauce brands we acquired in May 2001. Now, we are focusing on leveraging our more substantial European presence for improved growth. To further augment our European effort, we have recently acquired Erin Foods, the #2 dry soup company in Ireland. In Australia, we have strengthened our presence in the snack market through the acquisition of Snack Foods Limited, the #2 salty snack company. Given our #1 position in biscuits with the Arnott's brand, we are now even more competitive in the broader snacking category. To help foster greater organic growth, we created a new growth business unit with a charter to identify new opportunities that do not naturally fall within the scope of our existing business units. 4. Drive Quality and Productivity. We have substantially improved our ability to create superior products by increasing research and development resources, and by introducing a comprehensive product quality tracking and improvement process across our top-selling 150 products. On the productivity side, we generated well over $100 million in savings in fiscal 2002, and we have targeted an even greater amount in fiscal 2003.

Chairman's Message In fiscal 2002, we completed the first year of our Transformation Plan. Clearly, we followed through with key investments necessary to lay the foundation for future success. Product improvements are creating consumer preference, brands are being strengthened, and stronger partnerships are being formed with our customers for mutually profitable growth. Importantly, additional emphasis is now being placed on strategic breakthroughs, of which Campbell's Soup at Hand is the first example. The two strategic acquisitions in Ireland and Australia approved by the Board are consistent with our strategy to build our business in geographies and categories we know well. We continue to evaluate ways to leverage this strong cash flow to create shareholder value. 5. Improve Organization Excellence and Vitality. Revitalizing our workforce is essential to the success of our Transformation Plan. By strengthening our functional capabilities, expanding the capacity of our business units, and improving the morale of our associates, we have galvanized our organization and attracted talented new leaders. To ensure that we stay on track, we have also implemented a systematic process to measure employee engagement and satisfaction. Outlook As we enter the second year of our Transformation Plan, our business is poised for growth, but not yet at the levels to which we aspire. We will continue to invest, for the long-term, in brand building, innovation, quality, and infrastructure. We expect our soup business to achieve positive growth this year as we see more of our revitalization plan pay benefits. We also expect to see continued growth in our broader portfolio, including our Biscuits and Confectionery businesses. Capital spending will remain at a higher level as we continue to invest in our soup plants with new and enhanced technologies, and complete a new Pepperidge Farm bakery in Connecticut. Change is well underway at Campbell. We are pleased with the first year of this change, but we still have much more to do to resume our winning ways ... and we will. Sincerely, The Board visited the company's largest manufacturing facility in Napoleon, Ohio, to see firsthand the new technology being used to improve soup quality and to meet with local employees. We are making significant capital investments in our facilities and we will continue to monitor the results of these investments. Campbell has been a leader in corporate governance, and the Board is reviewing the new requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the proposed New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards. Campbell already meets many of these requirements. The Board views these new laws as an opportunity to assess and strengthen our governance position. In November 2002, Al App and Charlie Mott will retire from the Board, and we will miss them. Al has been a Director since 1986. His perspectives as a scientist and international executive have been valuable. Charlie has been a Director since 1990, and has served as co-chair of the Finance and Corporate Development Committee since 1997. He has been a highly effective leader in evaluating investment, finance, and pension issues. The nominees to succeed them are Randall W. Larrimore, President and CEO of United Stationers, Inc., and David C. Patterson, Chairman of Brandywine Trust Company. Randy brings outstanding leadership skills and many years' experience in the consumer goods industry. David brings important experience in the legal and investment management areas. I am confident Randy and David will be valuable additions to the Board. Sincerely,

Douglas R. Conant President and Chief Executive Officer

George M. Sherman Chairman of the Board
