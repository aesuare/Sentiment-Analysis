Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. | 2010 Annual Report
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS,
e were pleased with our 2010 results, especially as compared to the 2009 year - which we believe
was the most difficult operating environment our Company and our industry has ever experienced. 2010 provided another good test of our business strategy and our ability to operate in a highly volatile market. It was not as difficult as 2009, but it was far from the ideal business environment. We were able to grow the Company both internally and through a couple of good acquisitions, but it was still a challenging year.
We entered 2010 with a solid balance sheet and we exited the year in an even stronger financial position. Our net debt-to-total-capital ratio was only 23.5% at December 31, 2010 and we had about $860 million available on our $1.1 billion credit facility. This provides ample funds for us to continue our growth initiatives through both acquisitions and internal activities. This financial strength and our confidence in our future operations also prompted us to increase our dividend for the 16th time since our 1994 IPO. For the 2010 year, net income was $194.4 million, up 31% from net income of $148.2
million for the 2009 year. Earnings per diluted share were $2.61 for the 2010 year, up 30% from earnings per diluted share of $2.01 for 2009.
Demand improved during 2010 in many of
the industries where we sell our products and pricing levels for most of our products also increased over 2009 levels, resulting in sales
of $6.31 billion, up 19% from our 2009 sales
of $5.32 billion. Our tons sold, which reflects demand, were up only 6% compared to 2009. That’s not much of an improvement, especially after being down 32% in 2009 from 2008. But, when you look more closely at the different parts of our business, there are some areas
that improved significantly over last year, such as semiconductor and electronics; energy,
oil and gas; farm and heavy equipment; and
our toll processing activities that were driven
by improvements in the auto and appliance markets. Aerospace was also good for us again last year. Gains in these areas were offset in part by continued weakness in the non-residential construction portion of our business, which happens to be the largest single market for
our products.

“EXITED 2010 IN AN EVEN STRONGER FINANCIAL POSITION THAN WE ENTERED”
 Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. | 2010 Annual Report
Overall, we are proud of our performance last year as we led the way in our industry. Our efforts during 2009 to pay down debt, reduce operating expenses, and position the Company to operate profitably at low business levels certainly paid off.
Our sales per day improved during the first two quarters of 2010, as did our FIFO gross profit margins. During this time we saw mill pricing for most of our products increase. During the third quarter, however, we saw pricing for carbon and stainless steel products decrease along with our FIFO gross profit margins. Volume though,
was improving.
During the 2010 fourth quarter, we saw prices for stainless and aluminum products resume their upward trend through the end of the year. Carbon steel pricing was going the other direction until December when the mills announced a series of price increases. That helped us sell a little bit more at generally higher margins.
For the 2010 year, our gross profit margin was 25.1% compared to 26.3% in 2009, with a 2010 LIFO charge, or expense, of $34.8 million
compared to a 2009 LIFO credit, or income, of $305.0 million. The LIFO adjustments, in effect, reflect cost of sales at current replacement costs. Our FIFO gross profit margin was 25.7% in 2010 compared to 20.6% in 2009.
We continued to focus on managing our working capital and costs and efficiently running our operations. 2010 warehouse, delivery, selling, general and administrative expenses were 17.5% of sales, down from 19.4% of sales in 2009. We also improved our inventory turns to 4.8 times in dollars, or 5.0 times based on tons.
We completed the acquisitions of Diamond Consolidated Industries (now known as Diamond Manufacturing Company) on October 1, 2010
and Lampros Steel, Inc. on December 1, 2010. Diamond Manufacturing Company specializes in the manufacture and sale of specialty engineered perforated metals. Diamond is a high value-added, high margin business with its major end markets being agriculture, office equipment, electronics, appliance, auto and architectural. Diamond is headquartered near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and has three additional locations, including one we just opened near Dallas, Texas.

Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. | 2010 Annual Report
Lampros is based in Portland, Oregon and operates as a subsidiary of our American Metals business. Lampros specializes in structural steel shapes and carbon steel plate. Lampros has an outstanding reputation for customer service and its products will complement those of American Metals Corporation in the Pacific Northwest.
We have acquired 47 companies since our 1994 IPO. As business conditions for our industry continue to improve, we expect to see more acquisition opportunities as 2011 progresses. We will evaluate those opportunities in light of our highly selective criteria that includes strong management teams and a business reputation of quality and high levels of customer service. We also expect our acquisitions to be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow positive.
Our capital expenditures last year were $111 million. We opened new facilities in Malaysia; Orlando, Florida; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and are in the process of expanding several of our existing locations. Our Board of Directors recently approved approximately $200 million for our capital expenditure budget for 2011 and we are excited about our future growth.
In addition to investments in physical assets,
we also seek to invest in the retention and recruitment of the best employees in our industry. The safety of our employees is a top priority at all of our operations. During 2010 we were able to improve our safety performance over our 2009 level and we are focused on further improvement in 2011.
Our diversification of products, customer end markets and geographies has been an important factor in our consistent success. We believe
this diversification sets us apart from others in our industry and reduces the volatility in any one market from significantly impacting our financial results.
Our Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly cash dividend by 20% in the 2011 first quarter, to $.12 per share from $.10 per share. We have increased our dividend 16 times since our IPO in 1994 and have paid regular quarterly dividends for 51 consecutive years.
