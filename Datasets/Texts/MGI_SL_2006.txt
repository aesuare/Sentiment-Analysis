To Our Shareholders:
Any way you measure it, 2006 was an outstanding year for MoneyGram International. We achieved $1.16 billion in revenue, exceeding the $1 billion threshold for the first time, and our global money transfer agent network topped the 100,000 mark, closing the year at 110,000 locations.
Our financial results were driven by our money transfer business, which delivered more than 40 percent growth in transaction volume. Money orders and official checks continued their steady performance and our expanded line of bill payment services delivered excellent results in 2006.
Since going public two and a half years ago, MoneyGram has made great strides by pouring energy and resources into three critically important areas for our business: developing and deploying technology; expanding the MoneyGram global agent network; and building brand awareness. This very intensive and focused approach has helped us to grow our business at a rapid pace and establish MoneyGram as a global player in the marketplace.
MoneyGram’s value proposition of affordable, reliable and convenient payment services has found a receptive and enthusiastic audience with today’s consumers. This is reflected in our very healthy bottom-line and a total of return of nearly 21 percent to our stockholders, over 5 percentage points better than the S&P 500 total return for the year.
The numbers, however, tell only part of the story. A very important factor in fueling MoneyGram’s tremendous growth in 2006 was the dedication of our employees and management team. They appreciate how important MoneyGram’s services are to families around the globe and they strive daily to help us win customers and ensure that we keep them. Looking back on the year, I’d like to highlight just a few of MoneyGram’s achievements, thanks to this dedicated team:
• Net Income – Net income grew to a record $124.1 million.
• Transactions – Money transfer transactions grew 41 percent in 2006 over
our record volumes in 2005.
• Agent Network – The money transfer agent network grew 24 percent, reaching 110,000 locations at year-end. We re-signed the post offices in both the United Kingdom and Italy, and added a number of new agents including Telecom in Mexico, Banrural and Banco Industrial in Guatemala, United Bank of Africa in Nigeria, Privat Bank and the Ukranian Post Office in the Ukraine, Nix Check Cashing and Rent-A-Center in the U.S.
• Retail Strategy – We opened kiosks and stores in France and Germany as part of our retail strategy to develop core service networks in those countries.

MoneyGram 2006 Annual Report
• Marketing – We installed more than 23,000 new MoneyGram signs around the globe, making it easier for consumers to find our agents. We also worked closely with international agents in key markets
to transform almost 700 locations into highly-visible, MoneyGram-branded “red shops.”
• Website – A new user-friendly MoneyGram website was launched this year in 44 languages. It provides easy-to-understand information such as a new “price-it” feature and an enhanced agent locator.
• Product Development – Our on-going investment in technology has allowed us to branch out with an expanded suite of bill payment services, and we continue to roll out enhancements to our money transfer service. We continued rollout of our multi-currency system, and advancements in our AgentConnect® point-of-sale system are generating excitement among major agents converting to this streamlined platform.
The list of accomplishments is much longer, but these highlights present a clear picture of how MoneyGram is succeeding, and a preview of where we are headed in 2007. I expect the pace will continue to be brisk but our focus will remain the same: technology, network and branding — with an unrelenting commitment to value for our consumers.
I want to thank our employees, the management team and the board of directors for the strong support and commitment to MoneyGram. Success is always a team effort. Together we can deliver affordable, reliable and convenient services for our customers and success for our business partners and stockholders.
I particularly want to extend my thanks to Bob Bohannon, who retired as chairman of our board of directors at the end of 2006. Bob helped us put MoneyGram on the map! He initially led the company in the mid ‘90s when it was still Travelers Express. Bob helped shape our direction while at the helm of our former parent company, Viad Corp, and envisioned the future of MoneyGram as an independent organization. Bob was much more than my manager for 13 years, he was my mentor. His talents will be missed by the entire organization.
I look forward to 2007 and the opportunity ahead for MoneyGram. Sincerely,
Philip W. Milne
Chairman, President and CEO
MoneyGram Global Giving
 We strengthened our commitment to the communities where we do business this year with the introduction of an expanded MoneyGram Global Giving Program as well as our continued support for Habitat for Humanity. In 2006 MoneyGram awarded grants of up to $10,000 to dozens of non-profit organizations providing community services in three focus areas: basic needs and affordable housing; education; and global healthcare and disaster relief. We also built 42 homes in 18 countries around the globe with Habitat for Humanity, and closer to home, more than 100 MoneyGram employees joined work crews on Habitat builds in Minneapolis, Miami and Los Angeles.
