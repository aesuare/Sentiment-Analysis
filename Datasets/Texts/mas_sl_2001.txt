 TO OUR Shareholders2001 ANNUAL REPORT | m
MARCH 2002
To say that the last two years have been a period of challenge for Masco Corporation is a great understatement. We, along with many other companies, did not anticipate the speed or magnitude of the economic slowdown in our markets. Beginning in the spring of 2000, our sales and earnings were negatively impacted by a variety of factors, including reduced consumer spending for our products, unusual plant start-up costs, higher interest rates, weak foreign currencies, higher energy costs and customer inventory reduction programs.
In 2001, the slowing economy, exacerbated by the tragic events of September 11, contributed to even further reduced demand for our products, as did the negative wealth effect of the declining stock market, increased unemployment and lower consumer confidence.
Despite all of these challenges, we were able to build on our strong foundation and achieve record net sales in both 2001 and 2000.
FINANCIAL Results
Financial results for 2001 include:
• Net sales, aided by acquisitions, were a record $8.3 billion, a 15 percent increase over the $7.2 billion we achieved in 2000;
• Operating profit exceeded $1 billion for the first time in the Company’s history;

   • In the third quarter, our Company report- ed a $530 million pre-tax ($344 million after-tax), non-cash charge for the write- down of certain investments, principally securities of Furnishings International Inc., which had previously contributed approximately $.08 annually in earnings per common share. Including this charge, net income declined to $199 million from $592 million in 2000, and earnings per common share declined to $.42 in 2001 from $1.31 in 2000;
• Excluding the 2001 third quarter after-tax charge and the 2000 fourth quarter after- tax charge of $94 million, net income in 2001 declined 21 percent to $543 million1;
• After-tax return on shareholders’ equity, after adjusting for the third quarter charge, approximated 16 percent for 20011;
• Capital expenditures for the year were $274 million compared with $388 million in 2000 when we completed a number of major expansion programs at several divisions;
• The quarterly cash dividend was increased to $.131/2 per common share, marking the 43rd consecutive year in which dividends have been increased; and
• During 2001, the Company issued $800 million of 6.75% notes due 2006; $500 million of 6% notes due 2004; and Zero Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due 2031 for gross proceeds of $750 million. Proceeds from 2001 debt issuances were used principally to reduce floating interest rate bank debt.

The Company ended the year in a relatively strong financial position with cash in excess of $300 million and unused lines of bank credit of approximately $2 billion. Total debt as a percent of total capitalization was 48 percent at year end.
OPERATING RESULTS
Specific factors that contributed to our lower-than-anticipated earnings included:
• Reduced consumer confidence, as a result of the negative wealth effect caused by the stock market drop in 2000 and 2001, the uncertain economy and the tragic events of September 11;
• Increased unemployment;
• Reduced consumer liquidity and spending; and
• Continued inventory reduction programs undertaken by our retail and wholesale customers.
The combination of all of the above factors resulted in year 2001 earnings being below what the Company expected at the begin- ning of the year.

  FOUNDATION FOR Growth2001 ANNUAL REPORT | m
 internal sales growth, largely as a result of new products, industry growth and increased market share.
A variety of initiatives have contributed to our successful internal growth: coordinat- ing marketing programs that use shared customer and end-user research, combin- ing the resources of our operating divisions to maximize efficiencies and product offer- ings, and developing key customer incentive programs to help grow sales and increase market share.
Over the years, the Company has focused on our goals of achieving above-average growth and strong cash flow. This has been attained through a combination of internal growth, acquisitions and cost containment initiatives, as well as aggressive marketing, merchandising and new product develop- ment programs. Our goal over the next five years is to achieve the following approxi- mate average financial objectives:
• Average 6 –10 percent annual internal sales growth;
• Average 5 –10 percent annual sales growth through acquisitions;
• Average at least 15 percent annual growth in earnings per common share;
• Average 15–18 percent annual operating profit margins before general corporate expense;
• Average annual after-tax return on equity of 15–20 percent; and
• Improve our cash flow and return on assets.
INTERNAL Growth
Over the past ten years, excluding acquisi- tions, we have averaged 8.1 percent annual

Masco Key Retailer Program
Initiated in 1986, the Key Retailer Program has consistently driven incremental growth and market share gains and provided a competitive advantage for Masco. Through this effort, we developed coordinated pro- grams with key customers that leverage the collective strength of our individual operat- ing companies. During the past five years, Masco’s Key Retailer Program sales, aided by acquisitions, have increased at an aver- age annual rate of 29 percent.

  We estimate that approximately 90 percent of our sales are from products and services that represent leadership positions in their market segments. We believe that Masco’s leading brands have contributed signifi- cantly to our market share gains and to our sales growth.
CUSTOMER GROWTH PROGRAMS
In recognition of changing customer needs and the evolution of our Company, we revised two major customer incentive programs in recent years – the Masco Key Retailer Program and the Masco Builder Alliance Program. Both programs are now exclusively focused on the top tier customers in each market that utilize a number of products from the Masco family of companies. The objectives for these programs are:
• To reward our strategic customer part- ners for profitable sales growth; and
• To encourage customers to support a broader selection of Masco’s products.
Masco Builder Alliance Program
When introduced in 1987, the Masco Builder Partnership Program was the industry’s first comprehensive growth ini- tiative. Through coordinated efforts to meet quality, procurement, installation, training, upgrade selling and delivery needs, the Masco Builder Partnership Program was designed to offer leading builders the opportunity to increase sales and prof- itability. In 2001, the program was redesigned and renamed the Masco Builder Alliance Program (MBA) to reflect its renewed focus and customization to meet the changing needs of our builder customers.

   NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
New product development has always been an important com- ponent of Masco’s revenue growth. Over the past decade, it has taken on even more significance due to distribution shifts and the multitude of new products in the marketplace that must be properly positioned. As a result, in 2001, we formed the Masco Design Trend Council to work with our operating companies on long-term new product identification, innovation and inte- gration activities.
Council members are Masco employees who have expertise in new product development and are on the forefront of trends, colors and design. Through the efforts of the Council and our operating companies, Masco is able to provide distinctive, high-value products while leading the marketplace with new and exciting innovations.
CORPORATE Development
In addition to internal growth, Masco has experienced signifi- cant expansion over the past decade through our ambitious acquisition program, which continues to remain a key compo- nent of our overall growth strategy.
Masco seeks high-margin leadership companies with above- average growth potential that share the same cultural values and entrepreneurial spirit upon which Masco was founded. Key to our strategy is acquiring companies with annual sales generally in the range of $100 million to $500 million and oper- ating profit margins of at least 15 percent.
We seek companies that also have brand leadership positions and product or service lines that complement our existing companies. The type of companies that we strive to acquire are those which exhibit leadership in serving one or more of our key customer groups — homebuilders, wholesale and other distributors, home centers, mass merchants and other retail home improvement outlets. In addition, these companies share similar operating philosophies as well as strong man- agement teams that wish to remain with the Company.
2001 ACQUISITIONS
During 2001, Masco acquired the following companies with combined annual sales of approximately $1.4 billion:
THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE MANY NEW PRODUCTS AND FINISHES INTRODUCED IN 2001.
   |9

   • The Aran Group, an Italian manufacturer of assembled kitchen cabinets;
• BSI Holdings, Inc., a leading provider of installed insulation and other products within the United States and Canada;
• d-Scan, Inc., a style leader in the manufac- ture of ready-to-assemble products, includ- ing bookcases, entertainment centers and other home/office products;
• Griffin Windows Limited, a United King- dom manufacturer of door and window products;
• Milgard Manufacturing Incorporated, a leading manufacturer of windows and patio doors in the western United States; and
• Resources Conservation, Inc., an innovative manufacturer of energy and water saving showerheads and decorative trim products.
While our acquisition efforts have been aggressive, we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and have, when appropriate, divested companies that were inconsistent with our growth and profit- ability objectives or were no longer a strate- gic fit with Masco. Two companies that were identified as not core to our long-term growth strategies were divested in 2001.
INSTALLATION SERVICES GROWTH
Through a number of acquisitions in the past seven years, Masco has achieved a significant presence in the service industry. Net sales of installation and other services have grown from less than $100 million in 1995, when we entered the installation business, to $1.7 billion in 2001.
In 2001, Masco introduced Masco Contractor Services (MCS) as a key initiative to specifically focus on builder customer needs. Under this umbrella, MCS offers a nationwide network of leading providers
and installers of insulation and other building products.
Composed of BSI Holdings, The Cary Group, Davenport Insulation Group and Gale Industries, MCS, with over 300 branch loca- tions and 12,000 employees, serves builder customers throughout the United States.
Recognizing that customer needs are changing, MCS provides integrated solu- tions to builders through a variety of instal- lation services—primarily insulation and, in certain locations, a broad range of other products, including cabinetry, gutters, sid- ing, windows and fireplaces. Currently, Masco installs products in approximately 60 percent of all new single-family homes.
In 2001, MCS announced its inno- vative energy performance program— Environments for LivingTM. The program is designed to help builders with a system-based approach to the design and application of the principles of building science as they relate to energy usage. Environments for Living-certified homes offer increased homeowner comfort and satisfaction through improved energy utilization—a significant product offering for our builder customers. We believe that Environments for Living will provide a plat- form for new energy efficient products as we help move the construction industry into a new paradigm of quality building design.

  FOUNDATION FOR THE Future2001 ANNUAL REPORT | m OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE
We continue to be optimistic regarding Masco’s future outlook. Many of the factors that negatively impacted our business in the past two years might reverse themselves in the next few years. Customer inventories will need to be rebuilt, interest rates and energy costs are lower, consumer confi- dence is improving, and foreign currencies are more favorable than they have been for the past several years. In addition, increased focus on the home should help to expand consumer demand for our products.
We believe that the Company’s growth potential today is greater than ever before. During the first few months of this year, we have experienced a partial recovery in our businesses in North America and, if present economic trends continue, we believe that we will achieve significant improvement in sales and earnings in 2002.
As we look to the future, striving to build upon our strong foundation, we take pride in our products and services that represent leadership positions as well as a culture that values excellence, innovation and entrepre- neurial vision. These are the principles that we will continue to embrace as we all work together to meet our financial and opera- tional goals and achieve above-average returns for our shareholders.
Richard A. Manoogian
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Raymond F. Kennedy
President and Chief Operating Officer
We firmly believe that in order to be successful in today’s dynamic, intensely competitive global marketplace, a company must continuously reinvent itself to survive and prosper. To this end, in 2000 we formed corporate teams to evaluate all aspects of our business. The teams focus principally on broad strategies and specific tactics to achieve our growth objectives, improve profitability and increase cash flow.
During 2001, these teams successfully identified and implemented a number of ini- tiatives that should contribute positively to our future results.
While we have many challenges ahead of us, we are committed to increasing shareholder value by containing costs, max- imizing efficiency, marketing our products and services aggressively, maintaining a culture that is committed to continuous improvement in everything we do and continuing our history of growth. We believe that in order to build upon our already- strong foundation, we must remain diligent in evaluating our progress and the strate- gies implemented to attain our goals.
Our over 55,000 employees are integral to this process, and we continue to appreciate their continued commitment to quality and their service to Masco and our customers.
We would especially like to thank Arman Simone and Peter Stroh, who retired from our Board of Directors last year, for their many years of valued service to the Company.
