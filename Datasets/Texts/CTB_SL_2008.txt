2008 Annual Report
    To our Shareholders:    2008  was  a  year  of  extreme  volatility  for  the  tire  industry  and  Cooper  Tire  &  Rubber  Company.  In  only  my  second  year  with  Cooper,  we  were  presented  increasing  and  unprecedented  challenges  driven  by  the  tumultuous  economic  environment.  At  the  same  time,  we  had  successes  and  opportunities  develop  that  are  truly exciting.     In  February  2008  our  newly  developed  Strategic  Plan  was  communicated.  Since  development  of  the  plan  we  have  encountered  floods,  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  the  meltdown  of  the  credit  markets,  oil  prices  that  started  the  year  around  $75  per  barrel,  spiked  mid year  at  nearly  $150  per  barrel,  and  ended  the  year  at  around  $45  per  barrel.  We  also  entered  into  what  some  have  termed  a  global  recession.  Demand  for  replacement  tires  declined  for  the  second  of  three years, an extremely unusual pattern for the industry. All of this  impacted  our  2008  results.  What  it  camouflaged  is  the  focus  on  and  progress  we  have  made  toward  the  four  imperatives  in  our  strategic  plan  and  our  efforts  to  build  a  stronger  Cooper.  Those  imperatives are:    1) Build a sustainable, costcompetitive position,  2) Secure a costeffective supply of tires,  3) Develop  the  right  organization  and  execution  capabilities  to  support the strategy, and  4) Deliver profitable topline growth.    While  implementing  elements  of  the  strategic  plan  in  2008,  our  existing  operations  were  able  to  lower  production  costs,  excluding  the  impacts  of  shutdowns  due  to  soft  demand.  This  improvement  should  continue  in  2009  as  we  implement  the  closure  of  our  Albany,  Ga.  plant  and  continue  to  implement  Six  Sigma,  LEAN  and  automation  projects.  We  also  continued  investing  in  facilities  in  lower  cost  countries.  This  positions  us  for  improved operating costs,  greater  geographic  flexibility,  and  the  ability  to  penetrate  markets  outside of the United States.      To enhance our capabilities and enablers, we have continued to shift  the culture at Cooper to a continuous improvement mindset. To that  extent  we  have  trained  black  and  green  belts,  as  part  of  our  LEAN  Six  Sigma  efforts,  as  well  as  made  internal  changes  to  the  organization's  structure  to  support  quick  and  sustainable  improvements to our operations.    Topline  growth  will  see  an  increased  focus  in  2009.  To  address  the  topline  in  the  past,  we  launched  new  premium  products  that  position  us  very  well  for  growth  in  that  segment  of  the  market.    In  fact  over  30  percent  of  our  sales  are  from  products  launched  in  the  last  two  years.  The  Cooper  brand  continued  with  a  strong  performance.  In  2009  we  will  launch  products  aimed  at  the  value  segment  of  the  markets.  As  our  competitiveness  improves,  our  ability  to  grow  our  top  line  increases.  We  are  also  very  aggressively  pursuing  business  that's  positioning  our  products  in  channels  of  the  market where we are currently underrepresented.       Market  improvements  would  certainly  be  helpful  in  getting  our  bottom line back to a healthy position, but we are not simply waiting  for  that  to  happen.  As  we  continue  to  execute  our  plans,  we  believe  that  each  step  we  take  should  improve  our  ability  to  generate  profits.  Times  have  been  difficult  recently,  but  we  are  headed  in  the  right  direction,  focused  on  the  right  actions,  and  have  the  strength,  skills  and  ability  to  implement  what  it  will  take  for  us  to  deliver  better results and capitalize on future opportunities.          We  are  fortunate  to  be  in  a  position  of  flexibility  with  the  deployment  of  our  capital,  should  economic  circumstances  require  additional  adjustments.  We  still  have  cash and untapped  credit  lines  available  to  us.  We  will  continue  to  tightly  monitor  spending  and  capital  expenditures  during  this  period.  We  have  suspended  the  repurchase of  shares  and  debt, limited  expenses  where  possible,  and  are investing only in the items that are critical to Cooper's success.    For 2009, we expect that in the first half of the year industry volumes  in North America will be down compared to 2008. In the second half  of  2009  we  believe  it  is  possible  the  market  will  begin  to  rebound.  China  has  recently  experienced  doubledigit  growth  in  replacement  tires.  This  is  unlikely  to  occur  in  2009,  but  we  believe  growth  in  the  mid to high singledigit range is possible. European markets are also  likely to experience declines.     Raw  material  costs  were  extremely  volatile  in  2008.  In  2009  we  expect  costs  to  be  less  volatile  and  as  companies  begin  to  buy  raw  materials again, we could see prices strengthen later in the year. Our  cash  flows  should  benefit  as  these  raw  materials  work  their  way  through inventory.      We  remain  committed  to  the  strategic  plan.  The  path  to  achieving  the  goals  in  that  plan  has  certainly  been  rockier  than  we  initially  anticipated.  We  have  already  had  to  make  very  difficult  decisions  to  continue our progress. The actions we have taken and are taking will  continue to move us along this path.      We are cautious in our expectations of future profitability because of  the  uncontrollable  factors  which  impact  this  industry:  consumer  confidence,  gasoline  prices,  raw  material  cost  volatility,  intense  competition  and  currency  fluctuations.  We  expect  there  to  be  continued  pressure  on  the  industry  as  demand  for  tires  in  the  short  term  is  affected  by  global  economic  conditions.  The  plans  we  implement  will  address  those  conditions  as  we  reposition  the  Company  to  emerge  from  the  current  recession  as  a  much  stronger  competitor.      Several  factors  should  help  Cooper  look  different  at  the  end  of  2009,  than in 2008. They include:     improved  fixed  cost  structure  as  we  move  from  four  plants  to  three in the U.S.,   further  benefits  of  automation,  complexity  reduction  and  process improvements lowering our manufacturing costs,   improved  momentum  in  the  market  due  to  new  products  and  customers,   increased units from our joint ventures,   government incentives, and   renegotiated labor contracts.    The  Board  of  Directors,  management,  employees,  and  I  are  committed  to  delivering  improvements  for  all  stakeholders  of  the  Company.      We  thank  you  for  your  support  and  confidence  during  these  turbulent times.          Roy Armes  Chairman of the Board,  President and Chief Executive Officer
