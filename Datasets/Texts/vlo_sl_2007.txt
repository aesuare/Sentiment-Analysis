  to our stockholders
2007 WAS A GREAT YEAR FOR VALERO.
WE EARNED $7.72 PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, MAkING THIS ONE OF THE BEST YEARS IN OUR HISTORY. WE WERE VOTED FORTUNE MAGAzINE’S
No. 1 BEST BIG COMPANY TO WORk FOR IN AMERICA. IT WAS ALSO A GREAT YEAR FOR OUR STOCkHOLDERS. VALERO CONTINUED TO GROW SHAREHOLDER VALUE WITH A TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF MORE THAN 37 PERCENT – FAR BETTER THAN THE S&P 500’S 5.5 PERCENT RETURN. CASH RETURNED TO YOU, OUR STOCkHOLDERS, WAS AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. WE RETURNED $6 BILLION IN CASH BY INCREASING OUR ANNUAL DIVIDEND 50 PERCENT TO $.48 PER SHARE, AND PURCHASING 14 PERCENT OF OUR SHARES OUTSTANDING. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE HAVE PURCHASED NEARLY 120 MILLION SHARES OR 19 PERCENT OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARE COUNT. OUR EARNINGS POWER HAS NEVER BEEN STRONGER, AND OUR YEAR- END BALANCE SHEET WAS ONE OF THE STRONGEST WE’VE EVER HAD.
OUR VISION IS TO BECOME A wORLD-CLASS COMPETITOR IN THE GLOBAL ENERGY BUSINESS, GENERATING INDUSTRY- LEADING RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENTS. As we strive to achieve this vision, we are committed to pursuing excellence
in all aspects of our business and are making investments to achieve the best results for our stockholders. We remain employee-focused, socially conscious, community-minded, safe, reliable and environmentally responsible.
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE IS wHAT wILL SET US APART FROM OUR COMPETITORS AND MAKE US STRONG IN ANY BUSINESS CYCLE. Our tremendous growth over the past decade also brought certain challenges, as many
of the refineries we acquired had experienced years of underinvestment and reliability issues. We have a tremendous opportunity to improve our operating reliability as we address these issues for the long term. We are aggressively investing in high-return capital projects at our most competitive refineries, restructuring business units to take advantage of efficiencies, and optimizing our asset base to capitalize on the strengths of our logistically advantaged and complex refineries. Through all of our initiatives, we remain focused on safety and reliability.

 OUR COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE AT VALERO ALwAYS MEANS SAFETY FIRST, BOTH OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND PROCESS SAFETY. We are very supportive of OSHA and its Voluntary Protection Program (VPP), and have made it our goal to have each of our refineries designated as a Star Site under this program. In total, the company has 11 VPP Star Sites, of only 24 nationwide. Having VPP recognition means that these sites have achieved the highest recognition by OSHA for the personal safety of our employees. In 2007, three plants earned Star
Site recertification under OSHA’s even more stringent National Emphasis Program standards. Because safety is a team effort, several of our contractors have also been certified. We thank them for their support and commitment to our success.

However, VPP Star Site certification is not enough. We are also focused on process safety. Our Process Safety Management
(PSM) initiative is focused on identifying and implementing best-in- class processes in our facilities to not only keep our people safe, but keep our equipment performing properly and reliably. We are on track to make our PSM program rank among the best in our industry. Improved reliability is central to our success and the safety of our employees.
VALERO’S CAPITAL PROJECTS ARE KEY TO IMPROVED AND MORE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS – AND wE ARE MAKING STRIDES. As part of a 2007 capital expenditure program totaling $2.8 billion, we successfully commissioned major upgrade projects at our St. Charles, Houston, Corpus Christi, Ardmore, Port Arthur and Benicia refineries. We also have announced plans to construct two state-of-the-art hydrocrackers, one at St. Charles and the other at Port Arthur, as well as a new coker at Port Arthur. These projects are the largest ever initiated by Valero and are expected to be a $3.8 billion investment. When completed over the next three years, these projects will position our St. Charles and Port Arthur refineries among the leaders in the U.S. refining industry.
VALERO IS SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPGRADE AND OPTIMIZE ITS PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS. For our stockholders, generating the highest returns possible is critical. As we exercise discipline in allocating capital across our portfolio of assets, we recognize that it does not make sense to invest strategically in every plant, particularly our smaller or less-complex facilities.
Hard decisions must be made. Some of our plants may be more valuable to another owner with a different set of opportunities than Valero. As an example, the Lima, Ohio refinery, which we sold in 2007, was a good fit for the acquirer, Husky Energy. Lima refinery employees and the community now have better opportunities. Today, we are looking at strategic alternatives for four other refineries: Aruba, Memphis, Krotz Springs and Ardmore. At the end of this process, we believe that Valero will be a stronger, more competitive business for all of our stakeholders: our employees, our investors, our communities and our customers.
wE ARE COMMITTED TO EVALUATING ALL ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS FOR MORE EFFICIENCIES. In 2007, we restructured our retail business to make it more competitive by reducing its administrative costs. This contributed to our retail division’s most profitable year ever. We also restructured our refinery accounting

 and procurement business units and are centralizing more of our procurement activities to achieve better standardization and cost savings.
wE ARE COMMITTED TO INVESTING IN OUR ENVIRONMENT.
We made significant investments in environmental initiatives, not only to comply with increasingly stringent local, state and federal environmental regulations, but also to participate
in voluntary environmental programs. While our industry is constantly challenged by new environmental regulations, Valero
continues to demonstrate that with technology and ingenuity, it is possible to produce clean-burning fuels and be a good environmental steward.
OUR EMPLOYEES DRIVE ALL OF OUR INITIATIVES, THE SUCCESS OF OUR COMPANY, AND IMPROVED SHAREHOLDER RETURNS. Throughout this 2007 Annual Report, you will be reading about successes, milestones, accomplishments, projects and commitments. Behind every achievement in this report are hard-working, dedicated, smart people who drive our business and care for our communities. We are proud of our people and are committed to providing them with a challenging, enjoyable and rewarding work environment with opportunities for professional growth and development. Our goal is to continue to foster their growth so that, together, we can realize our vision and the earnings potential of our assets.
VALERO IS POSITIONING ITSELF TO MEET THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR INDUSTRY. As we enter 2008, we have very high prices for crude oil, and gasoline margins have fallen from last year’s very high levels. In a political climate of mixed messages, Congress has enacted new CAFE targets, maintained limited

 access to the offshore Continental Shelf for exploration and production of oil, and is considering more intense greenhouse gas legislation that we believe will further increase the cost
to consumers for refined products and weaken our global competitiveness. Valero continues to work to reduce emissions, but new product specifications continue to require refineries
to install more heaters, furnaces and boilers, which increase greenhouse gas emissions. Ethanol can be a viable component of the fuel supply, but it also has greenhouse gas implications. We are concerned that the renewable fuels industry’s effect
of increasing grain prices may have a far worse impact on the world than climate change. We believe that a balanced, well- thought-out energy policy, based on good science, will yield sound economic decisions.
For these reasons, 2008 could be a challenging year for Valero. However, there is no doubt in my mind that oil and natural gas will continue to be the low-cost and more efficient energy source for the world. As we invest in projects at our refineries that enhance our ability to turn low-cost feedstocks into high-quality refined products, we further position our company to continue to be an efficient producer of the fuels that keep America on the move.
OUR PRODUCTS IMPROVE PEOPLE’S LIVES. Things have changed in our industry over the decades, but one thing remains constant: our products add value to people’s lives. Our products power the world economy, and our industry has remained extremely reliable at supplying the market. Gasoline, diesel, heating oil, jet fuel, lubricants, chemicals – all of these products greatly enhance quality of life. In everything from plastics to clothing to medical supplies to computers, what we do adds real value. If you think about how our industry does it – the complexity of our processes compared with the low prices at which we deliver these products to the market – it is amazing. Our industry is truly a model of efficiency, and I am very proud to be a part of it.
Thank you to all of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders. We appreciate your support. We are focused on our vision and committed to pursuing excellence. We look forward to making our operations better than ever and strengthening our position as a world-class competitor.
