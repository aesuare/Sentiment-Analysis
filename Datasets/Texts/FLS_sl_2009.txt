To Our Shareholders:
The theme of this annual report is "People. Products. Progress." In its simplicity, that headline captures the success of Flowserve in 2009. It also reflects how we continue to build upon our position as the recognized leader in our industry.
As the new President and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, we are truly excited about the future opportunities for this outstanding company. We are also humbled by the responsibility that we share to sustain and enhance the two-century-long tradition of excellence built by the thousands of past and current Flowserve employees. That's where it all starts -- our people. The business results and returns for our shareholders in 2009 were made possible through the efforts of our 15,000 employees in more than 50 countries. Their dedication was instrumental in maintaining our place as a leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems and the expansion of our efforts to support infrastructure initiatives around the world. On the products front, we continue to focus on developing and manufacturing precisionengineered flow control products for critical service applications in the oil and gas, power generation, chemical, water and general industry markets. Our portfolio continues to include pumps, valves and seals, as well as automation and aftermarket services. In addition to new strategic initiatives, in 2009 each division launched new products or announced innovative new features to existing offerings, all strengthening our already impressive product portfolio. These primary offerings are enhanced by two key elements. The first is our ongoing investment in research and development, totaling more than $90 million over the last three years. The second factor points back to our people. It is the combined experience and expertise of our employees -- unmatched in the industry -- that allows us to deliver truly unique solutions and services to our customers. Flowserve progress is best demonstrated by continued execution of our strategic globalization initiative, particularly in geographies we've identified as being significant to our future growth. In the Middle East, we teamed with joint venture partner Al-Rushaid Group to open the region's largest pump manufacturing, repair and testing facility. We also expanded our existing seal joint venture with S&A Abahsain in Saudi Arabia to include valve manufacturing.

Two other important joint ventures also enhanced our valve business opportunities in Asia and Europe. Partnering with a Chinese corporation, we created a company where we plan to manufacture safety-related valves exclusively for China's civilian nuclear power industry. And in Italy, bringing together proprietary technology through another joint venture, we plan to deliver highperformance control valve solutions to oil and gas customers. Supporting continued growth opportunities in renewable and alternative energy sources, we acquired Swiss company CALDER AG, a leader in energy recovery devices and related products for the seawater reverse osmosis process. This addition allows us to deliver an integrated desalination flow control solution and provides expanded access to the global desalination market. Despite the challenging worldwide economic environment, we continued to see significant customer wins in 2009. We announced a $45 million deal to supply critical safetyrelated valves for two new Westinghouse nuclear plants in the U.S., as well as a multi-million dollar valve order from

Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power. In Brazil, we received several related orders worth a total of $18.4 million from Petrobras to support their Plangas initiative. We signed an $8 million order from Shell Malaysia Exploration & Production to aid in the oil recovery efforts for the St. Joseph field in the South China Sea. Flowserve also received a $3 million order for desalination projects in Spain, including the Campo de Dalais project, which will utilize CALDER Dual Work Exchanger Energy Recovery (DWEER) units. As part of ongoing efforts to drive a customer-centric culture, we announced plans to operate the Flow Solutions Division and the Flowserve Pump Division as a single organization to be known as the Flow Solutions Group. This unified organization is dedicated to providing Flowserve customers worldwide with an unprecedented level of rotating equipment and related products, services and support. In addition to our ongoing focus on our strategic continuous improvement processes, early in 2009 we announced an operational realignment strategy that included plans to reduce and optimize certain non-strategic

manufacturing facilities and our overall cost structure. The effort utilized our strong cash position to more aggressively drive cost reduction initiatives that better support the alignment of our core products, markets and geographies. After seeing substantial benefits from this initial effort, we expanded the realignment initiative to total $68.1 million in charges, achieving savings of $33 million in 2009. For identified projects, we expect to achieve savings of $95 million in 2010 and an annual run-rate savings of $110 million, the majority of which will be structural, from the 2009 charges and the approximate $20 million of additional costs in 2010. We are confident that these two significant organizational initiatives -- combined with the unwavering spirit and dedication of our employees -- are key to delivering on our promises to both our customers and shareholders. In the end, it is our people, products and progress that will continue driving our success for years to come.
