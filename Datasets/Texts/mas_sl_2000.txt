TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
ALTHOUGH WE ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT SALES GROWTH IN THE YEAR 2000, IT WAS A DISAPPOINTING YEAR IN TERMS OF INITIAL SALES EXPECTATIONS AND ACTUAL EARNINGS. DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS WAS REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE WEALTH EFFECT OF THE DECLINING STOCK MARKET, LOWER CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND HIGHER ENERGYCOSTS THATNEGATIVELYIMPACTED CONSUMER DISPOSABLE INCOME. IN ADDITION, OUR EARNINGS WERE IMPACTED BY GREATER-THAN-EXPECTED COSTS FOR A NEW PRODUCT LINE, HIGHER INTEREST RATES, HIGHER ENERGY COSTS AND THE DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF EUROPEAN CURRENCIES. ALLOF THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED SALES AND EARNINGS RESULTS.
 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Despite the negative factors that affected our per- formance, Masco posted gains in sales, net income and earnings per share for the full year 2000. Financial highlights include:
• Netsaleswerearecord$7.2billion,a15percent increase over the $6.3 billion we achieved in 1999;
• Net income increased four percent to a record $592 million from $570 million in 1999;
• Earnings per share increased two percent to $1.31 in 2000 from $1.28 in 1999;
• After-tax return on shareholders’ equity approxi- mated 19 percent for 2000, just below our 20
 4
percent goal;
• The quarterly cash dividend was increased to $.13 per common share, marking the 42nd con- secutive year in which dividends have been increased; and
• Capital expenditures for the year were $388 mil- lion compared with $351 million in 1999, reflect- ing major expansion programs.
In April 2000, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 40 million shares of Masco Common Stock.

 RICHARD A. MANOOGIAN RAYMOND F. KENNEDY
Approximately 12.6 million common shares were repurchased in 2000, including shares purchased to offset 8.4 million shares of Masco Common Stock that we issued in July 2000 as a result of the adoption of an Executive Stock Purchase Program. This voluntary Program was made available world- wide to Masco’s senior divisional and corporate management members who are key to leading Masco Corporation to long-term success.
Approximately 300 employees participated in the Program and invested approximately $156 million in shares of Masco Common Stock. The Program represents a major financial commitment on the part of its participants, thus further aligning Masco’s key management with the interests of its shareholders.
OPERATING RESULTS
Specific factors that contributed to our lower-than- anticipated sales and earnings included:
• Lower demand for home improvement products, in both North America and Europe, and corre- sponding inventory reduction programs undertak- en by our retail and wholesale customers;
• Greater-than-expected start-up costs associated with the introduction of a major line of cabinetry at one of our cabinet divisions;
• Higher interest rates, which resulted in increased interest expense on the Company’s bank debt;
• Higher energy costs, which negatively affected virtually every area of our business, particularly freight and raw materials;
• Weaker European currencies that resulted in a reduction in European sales and net income when translated to U.S. dollars; and
• Lower margins in several of our business seg- ments, which were also adversely affected by the pre-tax charges discussed later.
The combination of the above factors resulted in year 2000 earnings being approximately $385 million pre-tax, or $.50 per share, below what the Company expected at the beginning of the year.
BUSINESS SEGMENTS
The Company recently redefined its business segments for financial reporting purposes and began reporting its results accordingly. Following is a brief overview of each business segment.
CABINETS AND RELATED PRODUCTS
Included in this segment are assembled and ready-to-assemble kitchen and bath cabinets; home office workstations; entertainment centers; storage products; bookcases; and kitchen utility products.

Net sales of cabinets and related products increased approximately 15 percent to $2,551 mil- lion in 2000 from $2,220 million in 1999.
PLUMBING PRODUCTS
This segment includes faucets; plumbing fittings and valves; bathtubs and shower enclosures; and whirlpools and spas.
Net sales of plumbing products increased two per- cent to $1,839 million in 2000 from $1,803 million in 1999.
DECORATIVE ARCHITECTURAL PRODUCTS
This segment includes paints and stains; mechan- ical and electronic lock sets; and door, window and other hardware.
Net sales of decorative architectural products increased 20 percent to $1,395 million in 2000 from $1,165 million in 1999.
INSULATION INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES
Included in this segment are the sale and installation of insulation and other products and the restoration of facilities damaged principally by natural disasters.
Net sales of insulation installation and other serv- ices increased 61 percent to $855 million in 2000 from $532 million in 1999.
OTHER SPECIALTY PRODUCTS
This segment includes staple gun tackers; staples and other fastening tools; hydronic radiators and heat convectors; venting and ventilation systems; modular office workstations; and grilles, registers and diffusers for heating and cooling systems.
Net sales of other specialty products increased three percent to $603 million in 2000 from $587 million in 1999.
GEOGRAPHIC RESULTS
More than 80 percent of the Company’s sales are generated by operations in North America, primari- ly in the United States. A brief overview of the Company’s sales by geographic region follows:
• Net sales in North America increased 14 percent to $5,947 million in 2000 from $5,238 million in 1999.
• Net sales of international operations, principally in Europe, increased 21 percent to $1,296 mil- lion in 2000 from $1,069 million in 1999. Sales growth in Europe continued to be acquisition driven, offsetting both unfavorable currency exchange rates and unfavorable market condi- tions, particularly in Germany where new construction and renovation activities declined significantly from 1999 levels.

 KEY RETAILER PROGRAM
Initiated in 1986 to capitalize on the exceptional growth of then-emerging home centers and other large retailers, the Key Retailer Program has been a significant driver of incremental growth and mar- ket share gains. In addition, the Program has pro- vided a competitive advantage for Masco by devel- oping coordinated programs for key customers that leverage the collective strength of our individ- ual operating companies.
Since this Program’s inception, aided by strategic acquisitions and mergers of companies that serve these large retailers, our key retailer sales have increased at an average annual rate of 26 percent.
We greatly value our partnerships with large nation- al and international retailers who participate in this Program. Examples of key retail customers include ACE Hardware, The Home Depot, The Kingfisher Group, Lowe’s, Sears, TruServ and Wal-Mart.
In 2000, partnerships with our key retail customers resulted in sales of $2.73 billion. The largest portion of our key retailer sales are to the three fastest-grow- ing retailers and our three largest retail customers— The Home Depot, Lowe’s and Wal-Mart, with 2000 sales approximating $2.2 billion.
      
       INTERNAL GROWTH
Our average annual internal sales growth of nine percent for the past 10 years has been achieved through brand leadership, coordinated marketing initiatives, new product offerings and a broad range of home improvement and building products that far exceeds that of any single competitor.
We believe that approximately 90 percent of our products are brand leaders in their categories, and Masco products are now sold through home improvement retailers and builders, contractors and distributors around the world.
GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITION
A key component of Masco’s growth strategy has been growth through acquisition of leading, high- margin home improvement and building products companies. Our acquisition strategy is to acquire companies with annual sales in the range of approximately $100 million to $500 million or more and operating profit margins of at least 15 percent.
We seek entrepreneurially-oriented companies that have established positions of product, brand and customer service leadership in the markets we serve—homebuilders, wholesale distributors, home centers, mass merchants and other retail home improvement outlets.
Masco’s own entrepreneurial philosophy, along with our professional management strengths and capabilities in marketing, manufacturing, engineer- ing and systems, creates an environment for suc- cessful synergy and continued growth and devel- opment of our acquired companies.
Since 1982, we have invested more than $7.0 bil- lion by acquiring more than 53 home improvement and building products companies.
Aided by acquisitions, our sales of home improve- ment (repair and remodeling) products have grown at an average annual rate of approximately 16 per- cent during the past 10 years, while the industry has grown at an average annual rate of five per- cent. In building products (new construction),

      including acquisitions, our sales have grown at a 10-year average annual rate of approximately 14 percent, compared with industry average annual growth of seven percent.
During 2000 and early 2001, Masco acquired the following companies with combined annual sales of approximately $1.3 billion:
• BSI Holdings, a leading provider of installed insulation and other products within the United States and Canada, acquired in January 2001;
• Davenport Insulation Group, one of the Northeast’s leading providers of building prod- ucts and insulation installation services;
• Ginger, a designer and distributor of high-end decorative bath accessories, lighting and related products;
• Glass Idromassaggio SpA, a manufacturer of acrylic bathtubs, shower trays and whirlpools and steam shower enclosures, based in Italy;
• Masterchem Industries, a national leader in the manufacture of specialty paint products; and
• Tvilum-Scanbirk A/S, a leading European manufacturer of ready-to-assemble products, including cabinetry, shelving, storage units and workstations.
FOCUS ON THE FUTURE
In the second half of 2000, our businesses were negatively impacted by the factors mentioned pre- viously, including the decline in the stock market, the economic slowdown and lower consumer con- fidence. We expect the impact of these factors to continue for most of 2001, resulting in a year of below-average internal growth for Masco.
Due to our less-than-satisfactory performance for the year and changing business conditions, we are reviewing all aspects of our businesses to improve our financial and operating performance. Our focus is on creating increased value for our share- holders through a number of cost reduction, sales growth, profit and cash flow improvement and other initiatives.
In the Fall of 2000, corporate teams were assigned to focus on specific areas of our businesses that will improve our long-term performance, including: acquisitions, business consolidation, business port- folios, cash generation, compensation, corporate departmental functions and expense, purchasing, customer initiatives, e-commerce, financial strategies, management development and succession planning and new product research and development.
The initial decisions of certain of these teams, as well as other factors, resulted in an approximate $145 million non-cash pre-tax charge that the
9
        
      Company recorded in the fourth quarter of 2000. These charges include the writedown of certain investments ($55 million pre-tax) and a charge regarding the planned disposition of certain oper- ating divisions that the Company believes are not core to its long-term growth strategies ($90 million pre-tax). These divisions have annual sales of approximately $600 million and the Company expects cash proceeds upon disposition to exceed $400 million.
Despite the weakened economy and correspond- ingly lower sales and profitability that we experi- enced during the fourth quarter of 2000 and into the first quarter of 2001, we remain optimistic about our future prospects.
The Company is taking a number of steps to improve its performance. We believe that these steps, when combined with our aggressive cost- reduction programs and proven strategies aimed at expanding our market share during economic downturns, should result in better performance for the Company late in 2001, and particularly in 2002.
Our intent is to maintain and enhance our product and market leadership positions through market share gains, product innovation and manufacturing excellence. Through the successful implementa- tion of our proven strategies over the years, which is the basis for our internal growth objectives out- lined in our five-year sales forecast, our goal is to generate sales of approximately $11.5 billion by the year 2005.
We greatly appreciate the commitment of all of our 48,600 employees. Their capabilities, initiative and enthusiasm, particularly during these challenging times, provide the foundation upon which we will build our future successes. We look forward to their continued efforts as we all work together to strive to meet our financial and operational goals and achieve above-average returns for our shareholders.
