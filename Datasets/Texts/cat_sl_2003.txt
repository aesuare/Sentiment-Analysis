        Chairman’s Letter to Stakeholders
       I truly believe there are many great companies out there—organizations with integrity, ideas and positive impact on our world—and I know how fortunate I’ve been to be associated with one of the greatest. It’s been 43 years since I joined Caterpillar as a college graduate in 1961, and only when I became chairman and CEO did I truly begin to understand the respect the world holds for this company. The Caterpillar name is so well-known and our reputation so well-deserved. With that comes a responsibility for excellence and ever-higher expectations for every product we make and service we offer. What makes me most proud is the way Caterpillar people continually respond to these challenges—and 2003 was certainly no exception.
Great results—all around 2003 represented the first year, after four years of virtually flat or declining sales, that we’ve seen real growth in our business. Our sales reached $22.8 billion, an increase of 13 percent over 2002, and we anticipate 2004 sales to be 12 percent higher still. Our growth objective of $30 billion in sales and revenues is very achievable—by the end of the decade as targeted or perhaps even sooner.
Our stock price has tracked our improving results, closing the year in December at $83.02. Overall in 2003, Caterpillar stock achieved an 82 percent increase over 2002—the second highest among companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Index. And our three-year average return of 25 percent outpaced others in our industry by a wide margin. People are recognizing our performance and acknowledging that we’re on the right path, that we’re in the right businesses and that as the economy continues its upswing—watch out. Caterpillar promises to be a force to be reckoned with.
Nowhere is that confidence more apparent than internally. Our employees believe in the direction we’re going—and are excited about what’s to come. That was evident in our annual employee survey, which garnered positive increases in each of the 12 key dimensions we measure. While we can always do more to improve employee engagement, it’s gratifying to hear that we’re making real progress. This

    is a company that knows financial results aren’t all that matter. Developing, rewarding and motivating people to ever-higher levels of achievement is just as important—and integral to continuing success.
One way we’re doing that is through our continued focus on 6 Sigma. More than 2,300 employees are now working full time as Black Belts, leading 6 Sigma projects throughout the company around the world—and more than 25,000 employees, 240 suppliers and 95 dealers are engaged in projects in one way or another. And the impact goes far beyond what we can measure in numbers. An increased emphasis on 6 Sigma in our New Product Introduction (NPI) and Continuous Product Improvement (CPI) initiatives is contributing to better product quality and dealer and customer satisfaction. 6 Sigma teams are playing a huge part in developing new technologies, eliminating waste and reducing costs. People who once felt they didn’t have a voice or couldn’t make a contribution are now finding ways to take on more responsibility, solve problems and be leaders. 6 Sigma has been good for people—and what’s good for people is good for this business.
Great strides—in products and processes Caterpillar people have always understood the importance of anticipating changing customer and business requirements. We know how to keep reinventing ourselves to address new challenges and pull together as a team to meet them. Nothing exemplifies this spirit of ingenuity and customer focus better than ACERT® technology. In development for the past several years, ACERT came to market in 2003 with great success. Cat® engines equipped with this technology comply with the most stringent emissions reduction standards—without sacrificing reliability, durability or fuel economy.
Some have asked why we chose to go down a different path than the rest of the industry. We could have gone to market with the same emissions reduction solutions as everyone else—and certainly it would have cost us less in time and money. But it would have also presented the same set of problems everyone else is facing, and we knew that wasn’t what our customers wanted or deserved. And so our people took off down a new path and developed—in record time—a breakthrough solution that gives us a definitive edge in both the on- and off-highway diesel engine markets. In fact, we are the only manufacturer with a full line of EPA certified and compliant engines available for sale in 2004—and just as important, we have the building blocks in place to meet future emissions regulations.

        Chairman’s Letter [ continued ]
       Progress isn’t being made just in our product line, however. Two areas on which we’ve placed increased focus recently are safety and diversity. We significantly exceeded our safety targets in 2003, reducing lost days due to injuries by more than 40 percent in just two years. We still have a long way to go—ideally we’d reduce injuries to zero—but we are getting better because we have placed a focus on safety as never before using rigorous 6 Sigma methodology.
The same is true with diversity. Minority and female representation in our intern and new-hire groups continues to grow. We’ve formed partnerships with 12 U.S. colleges, including several historically African-American schools, in our efforts to bring a more diverse group of people into the Caterpillar family. We know that diversity, be it in race, gender, ethnicity, global experience or any other form, translates to more understanding, more ideas and ultimately a better end product.
Great futures—for all our businesses around the world What has always made Caterpillar a strong performer and a good investment is our solid business model. We are in the right businesses—those with a future and those tied to economic development. There’s no question that as world economies continue to turn around, we should see continued improvement. We are diversified in order to stay strong in a downturn and have positioned ourselves to excel when times are good.
Our focus includes a dozen critical success factors on which we base our strategic decisions. Ranging from growth and cost reduction goals to social responsibility targets, they keep us focused on the products, services and activities that deliver results for all our stake- holders—investors, customers, dealers and employees.
In 2003, we introduced a new critical success factor focusing on growth in China, India and the Commonwealth of Independent States— emerging areas of the world that represent a major growth opportunity for Caterpillar and our dealers. The Chinese market alone is large enough for us to justify producing equipment in that country, and we plan to be a major participant in the domestic Chinese market as we acquire, consolidate and bring new technology to Chinese companies.
