 Chairman and CEO letter to AES shareholders
Despite a continuing challenging macroeconomic environment, 2015 was an important year for AES. We achieved the majority of our strategic objectives by delivering attractive growth in free cash flow, increasing our dividend and advancing select platform expansion projects across our portfolio. Compared to 2011, we have significantly reduced the complexity of our portfolio, while at the same time we improved both safety and our operations.
As a result of our consistent actions in 2015, we generated Proportional Free Cash Flow of $1,241 million, up 39% compared to 2014 and $66 million above the mid-point of our guidance range. Unfortunately, we were unable to overcome all of the $0.11 impact from macroeconomic headwinds we faced and our resulting Adjusted Earnings Per Share was $1.22, down from $1.30 in 2014.
LONG-TERM STRATEGY
AES strives to create long-term shareholder value by providing safe and reliable electricity related services in the markets we serve. We believe that we have a unique portfolio of businesses with significant market presence in both stable developed markets and rapidly growing developing markets. This makes AES positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth in cash flow, dividends and earnings.
Underlying this growth in long-term cash flow is that AES was able to launch its largest construction program in its history. One reason AES was able to launch such
a program was the incorporation of financial partners into all of its new projects. We believe that having financial partners at the business- and project-level improves our risk- adjusted returns by providing a second market read and often times, additional returns from promotes or management fees.
In addition, AES is taking advantage of its international business platforms to include higher return projects based on new technologies, ranging from a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal in Panama, to lithium ion-based energy storage in the United States, to desalinization in Chile and super critical thermal plants in India.
The Board of Directors is deeply involved with management in reviewing its strategy and business development plans, as well as, ensuring that the company is developing the talent it needs to meet the challenges of tomorrow.
Growing Demand
AES’ markets offer attractive long-term potential for growth. In Panama, Vietnam and India, demand growth over the next three years is expected to be in the 6% to 10% range, while in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines, growth is in the 3% to 5% range. The one notable exception is Brazil, where demand for electricity dropped 5% in 2015 and we are not forecasting a recovery until 2018.
Technology and Innovation
With our leading position in energy storage and our diverse technology offerings,
we match the right technology with the specific needs of each market we serve. We also have a first mover advantage in many markets, realizing the economic and social benefits of modern electric infrastructure for our customers and communities. For example, AES implemented the first energy storage project in Chile, secured a 10-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for Panama’s first natural gas-fired plant and built Vietnam’s cleanest coal-fired plant with state of the art environmental controls.
Environmental Sustainability
Our development efforts are increasingly focused on natural gas, energy storage, solar and hydroelectric opportunities. We expect the global electric sector to reduce the carbon intensity of electric generation by retiring older, inefficient units and replacing them with new, natural gas and renewable capacity. We seek to maintain and strengthen our leadership position during this transformation.

2015 RESULTS

3,636 Added
As you are all aware, in 2015 we faced significant macroeconomic headwinds, including an average devaluation of nearly 30% at our non-U.S. Dollar-denominated businesses. We also faced a decline of more than 5% in demand at our distribution businesses in Brazil, which is now in a deep recession. Both of these challenges are persisting in 2016 and we are taking actions to mitigate their impact on our financial results.
Nonetheless, we continue to execute well on our long-term strategy to create sustainable shareholder value: simplifying our geographic footprint, improving our balance sheet and debt profile, fine tuning our financial exposure by bringing in partners at the business and project level and profitably expanding our local platforms.
Our key achievements in 2015 included:
• Returning 62% of discretionary cash to shareholders
• Increasing our quarterly dividend by 10%, to $0.11 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2016
• Investing $826 million in our balance sheet, by repurchasing shares, as well as prepaying and refinancing debt
• Bringing on-line 1,484 MW of new projects, with an additional 5,620 MW currently under construction and expected to come on-line through 2018
• Advancing select platform expansion projects in the Philippines, Panama and California
CREATING VALUE 2011-2015
Since late 2011, we have shown that we can successfully deliver on our strategic goals and during 2015, we extended our progress.
Reducing Complexity
By exiting businesses and markets where we do not have a competitive advantage, we simplified our portfolio and reduced risk. Over the past four years, we have raised more than $3.1 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales, decreasing the total number of countries where we have operations from 28 to 17. In 2015, we announced or closed $787 million in proceeds from the sales or sell-downs of seven businesses.
Leveraging Our Platforms for Long-Term Growth
We are focusing our growth on platform expansions in markets where we already operate and have a competitive advantage to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns. Since 2011, we have brought on-line 15 projects for a total of 3,636 MW. In 2015 alone, this included six projects for a total of 1,484 MW.
• 1,240 MW Mong Duong 2 in Vietnam – brought on-line six months early and under budget
• 152 MW Guacolda 5 in Chile
• 72 MW Estrella del Mar I in Panama
• 10 MW Kilroot Advancion Energy Storage Array in Northern Ireland
• 10 MW Netherlands Advancion Energy Storage Array in the Netherlands
We currently have 5,620 MW under construction, representing $7 billion in total capital expenditures, with the majority of AES’ $1.2 billion in equity already funded and expected to contribute a targeted return on our equity of approximately 15%.
Beyond the projects we currently have under construction, we will continue to advance select projects from our development pipeline.

In the Philippines, where demand growth is expected to remain around 5%, we plan to break ground in the first half of 2016 on a 300 MW expansion of our 630 MW coal-fired Masinloc plant. The $740 million project will be funded with a combination of partner equity, local debt capacity and free cash flow from the existing Masinloc 1 plant.
In Panama, along with our partner, Grupo Motta, we won a competitive bid for a 350 MW combined cycle natural gas-fired plant with a 10-year U.S. Dollar PPA. Using this bid as an anchor, we plan to build a 180,000 m3 LNG regasification and storage facility, very similar to the one we built and have successfully operated for 13 years in the Dominican Republic. The facility will be strategically located on the Panama Canal, allowing it to serve as a ship bunkering hub, as well as meeting unmet local and regional demand for natural gas. With the completion of this sister facility to our existing terminal in the Dominican Republic, we will be the largest LNG offtaker in the Caribbean and Central America. We expect to break ground on this project in 2016 with completion expected in 2018.
As you may recall, in late 2014, we were awarded 20-year PPAs by Southern California Edison (SCE) for 1,284 MW of combined cycle natural gas capacity and 100 MW of energy storage at our Huntington Beach and Alamitos facilities in Southern California. We are making good progress on permitting and licensing and expect to break ground on these facilities in 2017 with commissioning beginning in 2020.
Finally, we continue to maintain our place as the world leader in battery-based energy storage. We currently have 106 MW in operation in four countries. We have another 60 MW under construction and a further 228 MW in advanced stage development in the United States, Latin America and Asia, including the 100 MW we have under contract in California.
In addition to the nearly 400 MW that we have built or may build on our own business platform, we have reached important milestones toward third party sales of our proprietary, award-winning Advancion energy storage product. We recently signed
an alliance agreement with the Mitsubishi Corporation to sell Advancion in Asia and Australia and a similar agreement with Eaton Corporation for select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As a part of our drive to maintain the cost competitiveness of our product, we also signed an agreement with LG Chem to supply batteries for our pipeline of energy storage projects.
Performance Excellence
We strive to be the low-cost manager of a portfolio of international energy assets and to derive synergies and scale from our businesses. In 2011, we set a goal to reduce our G&A by $200 million by 2015 and in 2014 we achieved these reductions one year early. We recently launched an additional $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement initiative. This initiative will include overhead reductions, procurement efficiencies and operational improvements. We expect to achieve at least $50 million in savings in 2016, ramping up to $150 million, including modest revenue enhancements, in 2018.
Expanding Access to Capital
Partnerships help us to reduce risks and enhance our returns, as they provide an additional market read on our projects and often pay AES a promote or management fee. In fact, since 2011, we have raised more than $2.5 billion by incorporating financial partners on our construction projects.
Allocating Capital in a Disciplined Manner
Our top priority is to maximize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, by taking a long-term perspective on investing our free cash flow.

AES’ mission is to provide safe, reliable and sustainable energy solutions in every market we serve. Every day, AES people are driven to successfully deliver on our mission through our values:
             Executive Leadership Team
In 2015, the impact that AES’ values have on our people and our operations are clearly visible – we have seen improvements in all of our safety metrics and experienced no AES people fatalities. Further, AES and many of our businesses around the world were recognized for excellence in the following categories: customer service; sustainability and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR); best places to work; safety and the environment; and operational excellence.
In 2015, AES was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) for North America for the second year in a row by RobecoSAM. We were also named by Ethisphere as one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies for the second year in a row.
CONCLUSION
In summary, the macroeconomic environment has been and continues to be challenging. However, our strategy will allow us to weather this unfavorable environment and just as importantly, will allow us to continue to reposition our portfolio in spite of near-term headwinds. Furthermore, we will be able to capture the financial upside when these trends reverse. In the meantime, our portfolio generates strong and growing free cash flow and consistent with our track record, we will continue to cut costs, streamline our business and allocate our discretionary cash to maximize value for our shareholders.
