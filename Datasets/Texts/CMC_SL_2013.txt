To Our Stockholders
A Profitable Year
Commercial Metals Company achieved profitability in fiscal year 2013, despite significant industrial overcapacity and an extremely challenging global economic climate. Net earnings were $77.3 million, compared to $207.5 million last year. We achieved net sales of $6.9 billion in 2013, compared to $7.7 billion in 2012. Profitability even in times of adverse conditions in the marketplace is a testament to the strength of CMC, to the commitment of our 9,000-strong workforce, and to our management team. Our Americas Recycling segment was profitable in fiscal 2013 despite decreased ferrous and nonferrous scrap pricing and lower nonferrous margins. Adjusted operating profit was $3.2 million, compared with $39.4 million in fiscal 2012. Our Americas Mills segment achieved solid results in a highly competitive environment, with an adjusted operating profit of $204.3 million in fiscal 2013, compared with $235.9 million last year. Expanding margins, on the heels of declining raw materials input prices, helped our Americas Fabrication segment improve earnings. This segment attained an adjusted operating profit of $28.0 million, significantly up from a loss of $15.7 million the previous fiscal year. Continued poor Eurozone market conditions led to declining volumes and margins and lower selling prices for our International Mill segment, contributing to a $22.1 million reduction in adjusted operating profit in fiscal 2013 to $0.9 million, down from an adjusted operating profit of $23.0 million in 2012. Our Marketing & Distribution segment also faced uncertain and unfavorable global market conditions in fiscal 2013, though the segment did record an adjusted operating profit of $35.6 million, compared with a profit of $47.3 million in the prior fiscal year.

million in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012. We raised capital in 2013 through the public offering of $330.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.875% senior notes due 2023. Proceeds from the offering were used to retire our existing notes which were scheduled to mature in November 2013.

We also added $29.0 million of cash to the balance sheet in fiscal 2013 through the sale of our interest in Trinecke Zelezarny, a.s., a Czech Republic joint-stock company.

Positive Signs Going Forward
Despite a slower than optimal recovery and anemic government infrastructure spending in the U.S., as well as significant oversupplies and continued soft markets overseas, we see promising signs ahead, particularly for North American construction. Steel consumption, housing starts, private construction and non-residential construction starts are all on the rise in the U.S., which is a very positive trend for future steel demand.

Another positive indicator is the Architectural Billings Index (ABI). The August 2013 ABI reflected the strongest growth activity in six months and marked the twelfth time in thirteen months that design activity has increased nationally. This points to a healthy upturn in nonresidential construction activity, which is a good sign for CMC.

Improved Customer Service
Serving our customers is our primary focus at CMC. So we were very satisfied by our steel mills' improved performance in the Jacobson & Associates National Summary Rankings for Customer Satisfaction in 2013. In the category of Overall Customer Satisfaction we hold four of the top 10 rankings, with CMC Steel Texas at number one, CMC Steel South Carolina at number five, CMC Steel Arizona at number seven and CMC Steel Alabama at number 10. We will continue with customer-focused initiatives such as our myCMC web portal that make doing business with CMC even more convenient.

To our customers, CMC is committed to the highest level of service in the industry. To our people, CMC is committed to providing a safe work environment and the opportunity for all employees to reach their full potential. To our communities, CMC is committed to making the communities where we operate a better place to live and work. To our shareholders, CMC is committed to creating value.
