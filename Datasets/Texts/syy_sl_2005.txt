 To Our Shareholders:

Richard J. Schnieders “The Supply Chain Initiative is the largest strategic undertaking in the history of SYSCO, and we are convinced that our customers, suppliers and ultimately our sharehold- ers will benefit from the distribution efficiencies and competitive advantages that it will generate.”
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
We were deeply saddened for those whose lives and property were ravaged by Hurricane Katrina. Thankfully, almost all of our New Orleans associates are accounted for and many have been employed by other operating companies. No facilities were flooded or had significant structural damage and our New Orleans company was back in limited operation by mid-September. Our Houston, Dallas and Central Alabama operations have been shipping to areas normally served by New Orleans. Through our long-standing partnership with the American Red Cross, we have been supplying food for the relief efforts. All those affected are in our hearts and on our minds as they go about rebuilding their lives.
The majority of this annual report is devoted to our efforts to redesign our supply chain, so in this letter I would like to discuss the many other important initiatives we are under- taking to drive SYSCO forward in 2006 and beyond.
The year just ended was a difficult one for SYSCO.
Sales for the year were $30.3 billion, 3.2 percent above sales in 2004. Fiscal year 2004 contained 53 weeks, so on a comparable basis, 2005 sales were 5.3 percent higher than adjusted 2004 sales of $28.8 billion. (See reconciliation under “Results of Operations – Sales” in our Form 10-K for fiscal 2005.) This is below our stated goal of high single-digit to low double-digit sales growth. Sales during the year were negatively affected by higher than normal product cost inflation and higher fuel costs. Inflation hurts sales because restaurant customers have to pay more in order to purchase the same number of meals, while higher fuel costs take disposable income out of consumers’ pockets.
It is a testament to the dedication of our associ- ates that net earnings grew to $961.5 million, 6.0 percent higher than last year’s net income, while diluted earnings per share rose to $1.47, up 7.3 percent from last year’s $1.37. Our ability to drive costs down during the year was a key component of our ability to grow earnings and earnings per share at a higher rate than our sales growth.
Throughout fiscal 2005 we worked diligently on positioning SYSCO for future growth and we have several programs in place which will help produce profitable, sustain- able sales growth. Our Business Review program is a systematic method of consulting with our very best customers to strengthen and solidify our existing customer relation- ships. A typical business review involves extensive preparation and a meeting of several hours with the customer to review ways that we can contribute to their success. This involves everything from menu analysis to food product testing to access to our value- added iCare services. The results from these business reviews in 2005 were gratifying, and we plan to conduct approximately 40,000 reviews in 2006.
Coupled with our Business Review program, we continued to make progress in our Business Development program. Our operating companies have developed dedi- cated teams who are charged with going out into the market and in a systematic way, calling on restaurants and other food service venues that are not SYSCO customers. Their job is to convince these non-SYSCO customers that they should buy from SYSCO.
I should add that we remain committed to grow- ing the bedrock of our sales effort, our Marketing Associates. We have the largest, and we believe, the best sales force in the industry and we will continue to add to it to extend our lead. Our overall plan is to grow all of our customer contact personnel – our Marketing Associates, Business Review Managers and Business Development Managers, by at least 6 percent this year.

 In addition to investing in people for growth, we will also be investing in assets for future growth. During 2005 we spent $390.2 million on capital expenditures and we will increase that pace somewhat in 2006, with capital spending planned at the $425 million – $450 million range. Spending will be primarily in three areas: 1) for buildings – new and more efficient warehouses; 2) for fleet – both replacement and expansion of our truck fleet; and 3) for systems – to help us operate more efficiently and effectively.
One of the key concepts in our geographic expan- sion has been building fold out facilities. These are new operating companies that are opened on the geographic edge of an existing market which allows us to get closer to our customers. During 2005 we announced that we were targeting doing three fold-outs per year, up from our average of one and one-half per year. This year we have announced plans to open fold outs near Raleigh, North Carolina and in the Gulf Coast region of Alabama as well as replacing and relocating a smaller facility in central Illinois. We will continue to identify appropriate locations to fill in our markets and get closer to our customers.
We continue to seek appropriate acquisitions, both in our broadline and our specialty areas. During 2005 we added one broadline distributor, two produce distributors and four specialty meat distributors. These fine companies helped us broaden our reach throughout much of the United States and parts of Canada.
At the end of the fiscal year, Tom Lankford, SYSCO’s president and chief operating officer, retired after a distinguished 43-year career. He had served in many roles since his company was acquired by SYSCO in 1981. His passion for our business and his leadership of our company left an enduring mark that will be long remembered.
Restaurants are truly representative of the entre- preneurial spirit, fostering the belief that creative, hard-working individuals can truly control their own destiny and live their own dreams. Our job is to support that entrepreneurial spirit, nurture it and cherish it. Only by helping our customers succeed will SYSCO be successful over the long term.
