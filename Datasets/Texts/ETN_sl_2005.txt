Raising the bar for performance
To Our Shareholders:
Numbers stand for something, and so does a company like Eaton.
So in looking at the numbers – and performance – of Eaton in 2005, you may be asking what’s behind them. What do they mean? Why have they improved so significantly over the last five years? Who ensures they are accurate? And do they truly represent Eaton’s commitment to Doing Business Right?
In 2005, our 59,000 employees worldwide helped Eaton produce the best sales and profit numbers in our history. They know that how we achieve the numbers is as important as the numbers themselves. I want to congratulate our employees around the world for their performance in 2005 and dedicate this year’s annual report to them. They make you, our customers and our communities proud.
Standing Behind the Numbers
We are steadfast in our conviction and our commitment to achieving superior results while Doing Business Right. These two standards are tightly coupled and represent a source of pride that our values-based enterprise is actually the foundation of our strong performance. It is really pretty simple: We believe that great people have great values and they are attracted to companies that live those same values. So when we talk about Eaton as a premier diversified industrial – Premier Eaton – what it means to us is achieving superior results while Doing Business Right, every day – around the world.
Most organizations set goals. Fewer set stretch goals. Even fewer set transformational targets and report on them. Eaton has done all of this: identifying – and then quantifying – key mile- stones toward our vision for a more powerful future. We believe that measurement matters, and we hold ourselves accountable to meet the goals we set.
Delivering Record Numbers
In many dimensions, 2005 was a record year for Eaton Corporation:
• We grew sales by 13 percent, surpassing $10 billion for the first time in our history and reaching a record $11.1 billion.
• For the fifth consecutive year, our sales growth significantly beat that of our end markets – by $175 million in 2005.
• We completed eight acquisitions and formed one new joint venture. The two large acquisitions in our Aerospace business increased its size by nearly 50 percent to more than $1.2 billion in annual revenues.
• We increased our earnings per share by 27 percent to a record $5.23.
• We generated $1.13 billion in cash from operations, an increase of 35 percent and an all-time record.
• We increased our dividend by 15 percent.
• And, we delivered a 22.2 percent return on shareholders’ equity.
Eaton’s performance during 2005 is the result of our continuing transformation over the past five years. We have become a premier diversified industrial with a range of businesses able to perform well throughout the economic cycle.

Here’s how we are making progress toward meeting or exceeding our goals:
• Our five-year compound sales growth has been 7 percent, short of our 10 percent goal, but for the past three years, sales growth has exceeded 15 percent.
• Our five-year compound earnings per share growth has been 24 percent, substantially exceeding our 10 percent goal.
• We have not yet reached our 13 percent EBIT goal, but the improvements in our balance sheet have allowed us to solidly exceed our primary goal of achieving an 18-22 percent return on shareholders’ equity.
• Our quarterly dividend has increased by 41 percent in the past three years – and we increased the quarterly dividend another 13 percent in January of 2006.
• And, our annual compound total shareholders’ return for the past five years has been a very strong 18 percent.
Growth Numbers
Growth is the lifeblood of any organization. Strong growth fueled the vitality of our business during 2005. This is the fifth year in a row that we significantly outgrew the weighted average of our end markets. This demonstrates the value we deliver to our customers around the world. And it means that we continue to grow faster in our markets than our competitors. The breadth of new products and services we rolled out during 2005 is vast, ranging from our new line of Uninterruptible Power Supply products in our Electrical business, to VersaSteer, our innovative new steering product in our Fluid Power business, to our new SuperTurbo system in our Automotive business, to our new DM clutch in our Truck business.
While our focus on developing new products and services has been intensified, we have also maintained a vigorous focus upon value-creating acquisitions and new joint ventures. 2005 was a bumper year in this respect:
• In our Electrical business, we acquired Pringle Electric and launched a new joint venture in China.
• In our Fluid Power business, we completed the acquisitions of the Cobham and the PerkinElmer aerospace businesses. In addition, we acquired Winner, the leading supplier of hose and hose adapters in China, and we entered the filtration market with our acquisition of the filtration division of Hayward Industries.
• Our acquisition of the Pigozzi agricultural transmission business in Brazil strengthened our Truck business.
• In our Automotive business, the acquisition of Tractech Holdings broadened our customer base and added important new technology to our Traction Control business. And the acquisition of Morestana in Mexico strengthened our engine air management business.
Broader Numbers
Eaton is now larger and more diverse. Increased diversity in our business mix is a key element in our success formula. In fact, Eaton has never been better balanced in our exposure to the different stages of the economic cycle, to diverse world markets, and to increased revenue opportunities in aftermarket and service businesses. Our Electrical and Fluid Power businesses now
deliver two-thirds of our sales. Both segments now include significant late-cycle businesses in the aerospace and non- residential construction markets. We expect both to be strong sources of growth in the next several years. Our robust after- market business in our Truck segment provides an important source of earnings stability. Our growing Performance Products business within the Automotive segment now gives Eaton significant exposure to additional faster-growing market segments. And finally, our nearly $4.3 billion of revenues from outside the United States provide a significant global dimension overall. Breadth is good and Eaton now has it!
Future Numbers
While we are proud of our accomplishments in 2005, we recognize the pace of change that surrounds our enterprise. Success is redefined daily in each of the more than 125 countries where we do business. We are confident in our ability to achieve success because of the strength of our people. Ninety-seven percent of our employees around the world participated in our employee survey again in 2005. Their expressions of pride and commitment to our company and shared values truly have transformed Eaton during the past five years. The biggest reason you can count on Eaton is because you can count on our people.
With our foundation in place and our challenges in mind, we have again raised our future performance targets. For the 2005- 2010 time period, our new targets are:
• 10 percent compound growth in revenues,
• 15 percent compound annual growth in earnings per share,
• further enhancement of our cash flow through the retention of 9 percent annual revenues in free cash flow,
• and 15 percent return on invested capital.
We recognize that these are challenging goals and that they stretch us to work harder and smarter together. They are just the kind of goals necessary to continue to propel our company forward, while Doing Business Right.
We hope you share our pride in the new Eaton – Premier Eaton. We now have an extraordinary opportunity to elevate our performance further and to demonstrate that the important changes in our business breadth and mix will enable Eaton to perform better during each phase of the economic cycle. We believe we have the right strategy, a world-class business system in the Eaton Business System – and an outstanding team of employees!
Your company is better positioned than ever before to tackle the new opportunities and challenges that will emerge in 2006 and the years ahead. On behalf of all of Eaton’s employees, I thank you for your continued support.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
