Letter To The Shareholders
Old Republic achieved moderately lower operating earnings in 2004, following record results the previous year. Several highlights brightened 2004, including attaining the second highest post-tax operating income in our 81-year history, record net operating revenues and a competitive total return on shareholders' equity.

Post-tax operating income-defined as net income exclusive of investment gains-was $404.1 million or $2.19 per share, compared with $447.2 million or $2.44 in 2003. Net income reflected a somewhat better year-over-year comparison due to greater realized investment gains in the Company's bond and stock portfolio.

Continued strength in Old Republic's general insurance segment enhanced profitability, but weaker results in our title and mortgage guaranty lines, together with certain special charges in our small life and health line, detracted from overall growth. The table below provides a snapshot of the major components affecting year-over-year earnings comparisons.

Our 2004 results once again demonstrated the benefits of a balanced book of business that spans a large number of insurance coverages and industry sectors at the core of the American economy. Key performance indicators validated those benefits:

•	Net operating revenues reached a new high of $3.44 billion, up from $3.26 billion in 2003.
•	Net investment income rose for the second year in a row, reaching a record $290.8 million.
•	Consolidated operating cash flow grew 15.0% to $828.3 million, with most of it enhancing our invested asset base.
•	Consolidated assets crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time, advancing 8.8% to $10.57 billion. This was accompanied by a nearly equal percentage increase in shareholders' equity to $3.86 billion.
•	Benefit and claim reserves, net of reinsurance recoverable, were up 10.5%, topping $2.76 billion at year-end
2004.
•	Total return on shareholders' equity per share-representing the combination of increased book value and cash dividends paid-increased 10.8% based on a year-end book value of $21.17 per share.
 
Our long-established strategy of concentrating on what we do best was the driving force of 2004 operations. As always, we evaluated for acquisition several properties or blocks of business with a potential fit to our focused approach to insurance underwriting, but passed in each instance. The insurance lines we offer in our current markets continue to present opportunities to grow our business without deviating from the deeply ingrained underwriting culture that pervades each of our operating segments.

Operating Segment Results
Old Republic General Insurance Group produced superior underwriting and overall operating results. We nearly achieved-a year ahead of schedule-the objective we set for ourselves in 2001 of doubling our earned premium base by year-end 2005. From the 2000 earned premiums base of $857.8 million, 2004 earned premiums increased 89.2% to $1.62 billion. We believe we can fully meet our five-year goal, as conditions in the markets we serve favor maintaining pricing adequacy and developing new business.

In fact, 2004's 17.6% earned premium growth was significantly greater than the 10% to 12% range of our initial expectations for the year. In addition, the higher production levels were accompanied by continued improvement in our underwriting results. The composite ratio of claim costs and expenses to net premiums dropped to 90.7% in 2004, from 93.3% in the preceding year, leading to our best underwriting profit margins since the early 1980s. With a few minor exceptions, all the Group's profit centers and insurance coverages contributed to these noteworthy results.

Old Republic Mortgage Guaranty Group registered an 18.8% year-over-year decline in pretax operating income to $224.5 million in 2004. The Group's performance reflected moderate net premium growth and rising claim costs. A combination of lower origination volumes and greater reinsurance cessions largely negated the favorable effect on premium renewals of gradually rising business persistency.

The composite underwriting ratio rose to 61.1%, from 47.5% in 2003. The higher ratio reflected a higher claim component, which increased to 35.5% for 2004, from 22.7% in 2003. Higher claim ratios posted throughout 2004 represented more paid claims, as well as greater reserve provisions caused by expectations of moderately increased claim frequency and severity. Expense ratios for 2004 were relatively flat versus 2003. In fourth quarter 2003, class action litigation was resolved for approximately $5.0 million less than reserves recorded in the preceding year. Absent this credit, the Group's 2003 expense ratio would have been 26.0%.

Old Republic Title Insurance Group operating results declined in comparison with 2003. Premium and fee revenues were $1.02 billion, down 7.1% from 2003. Pretax operating income fell 51.7% to $62.5 million. The composite ratio was 96.3%, versus 90.4%.

The aforementioned special charges affected the Group's operating expenses and income. Also contributing to the decline was a substantial reduction in mortgage refinancing revenues, which after peaking in third quarter 2003 did not trigger a corresponding drop in certain relatively fixed operating expenses.

Corporate and Other Operations representing the combined results for Old Republic's small life and health insurance business (operating revenues of $71.4 million in 2004 and $58.4 million in 2003) and general corporate activities produced pretax net operating deficits of $17.2 million, versus $4.5 million in 2003. Results reflected holding company expense and debt service costs; investment income on temporary investment holdings; and, except for the effect of the above-noted pretax charge of $10.5 million, moderately higher earnings in 2004 from our total book of life and accident and health business.

Promises Founded on Financial Strength
The value of the insurance promises we make to policyholders, claimants, and creditors is founded on maintaining strong financial underpinnings. These underpinnings assure our shareholders that their equity in the Company rests on a similarly strong foundation. For an insurance business such as ours, whose promises of financial security must last many years into the future, key elements of that foundation are the amount and quality of the assets that fund those promises; the adequacy of reserves, which reflect the estimated dollar value of our obligations; the amount of capital we maintain to assure continuity and growth of our business; and the high financial ratings on which our customers rely. In 2004, we managed our business fully committed to these elements.

Cash and invested assets reached $7.51 billion at year-end 2004, up 9.8% from year-end 2003. All-time-high operating cash flows of $828.3 million made this growth possible, while unrealized investment losses and cash dividend payments to shareholders reduced its impact to a small extent. At year-end 2004, an average credit quality of AA distinguished the fixed maturity securities portion of the Company's portfolio, while cash and invested assets
 
represented 153.1% of our consolidated net liabilities. At the same date, consolidated policy and claim reserves, net of amounts recoverable from reinsurers, aggregated $3.68 billion, an increase of 10.4% from 2003. Importantly, aggregate claim reserves continued to develop favorably year-over-year and, as a result, did not adversely affect 2004's consolidated operating results.

The overall strength of Old Republic's consolidated balance sheet results from the composite financial underpinnings of its 24 individual risk-bearing insurance subsidiaries. At year-end 2004, independent financial ratings assigned to all our key policy-issuing insurance companies remained at very high, competitive levels.

Performance and Market Valuation of Old Republic Common Shares
The combination of rising book value per share, a long-term uptrend in earnings per share, and expectations of continued strength in Old Republic's operating results led the Board of Directors to approve a 14.7% increase in the annual cash dividend rate. This 23rd consecutive annual increase ranks the Company among only 140 publicly held American businesses to have raised cash dividend payments for 22 or more years in a row.

Market quotations for the Company's common shares remained virtually unchanged from year-end 2003 to year­ end 2004. The market did not reward shareholders with a higher price despite reasonable profit performance in 2004 that led to a 10.8% increase in book value per share and a higher cash dividend rate.

The lull in market appreciation of Old Republic's common shares does not, however, detract from the long-term performance of the stock. For the 35 years since Old Republic emerged as a publicly held insurance holding company, our shares have reflected a compound annual total market return of 14.9% and a compound annual book value total return of 15.5%. Both figures compare quite favorably with the 10.6% compound annual market total return for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

Outlook
The Corporation's financial strength and welcomed acceptance of the security, services, and competent people resources we provide in our chosen markets well position us for continued growth. In the housing-related fields in which Old Republic's mortgage guaranty, title, and home warranty businesses compete, our expectations are for steady progress in 2005. We base this expectation on the belief that reasonably stable interest rates and solid employment trends will provide continued access to home ownership to a large number of Americans. In our property and liability insurance business, we anticipate stiffer competition in the face of reduced opportunities to obtain pricing improvements for most of the coverages we offer. However, the business growth our customer base is likely to experience and our expectation of greater penetration of new markets and production channels should enable us to achieve both top line and bottom line growth in this segment. All in all, the composite image of our three major segments is reasonably developed to produce very satisfactory 2005 results for Old Republic shareholders.
