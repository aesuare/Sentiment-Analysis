   To Our Shareholders, Customers & Employees
When I joined Omnicare as CEO a little over a year ago, I was very excited about our company’s great potential; although I knew that in order to realize our many opportunities, we had to develop a plan to become more operationally driven and customer- focused. A year later, I am pleased with our progress and the results we have already generated. I am eager to share with you the story behind those results, the potential I believe is being realized, and the commitment from our employees in creating value and building the success we enjoy today. »
John Figueroa, Chief Executive Officer, in front of the New York Stock Exchange for the ringing of the closing bell to celebrate Omnicare’s 30th anniversary of trading September 1, 2011.
     
                 Ibelieve Omnicare has become an operationally driven designed to make our employees more engaged
and customer-focused company, well-positioned for long-term profitable growth. And with our success, I believe we are able to help transform the nation’s healthcare system and enhance the
quality of care at the lowest possible cost through efficiencies that were unimaginable just a few years ago.
2011 was about fulfilling promises.
We said we would invest in
technology, and we did that. Already
a leader in pharmacy automation,
Omnicare continues to make
investments in state-of-the-art technology
so advanced that I believe it will become
the standard for years to come. With automation
and standardization across the company, we are building a supply chain that we believe will actively revolutionize quality and innovation in the institutional pharmacy industry. In doing so, we believe we are creating tremendous value for our shareholders, for our company and for the many constituents across the healthcare continuum that we touch every day.
A year ago, we said we would reinvest in our people, and we did that. We created a company culture
and more effective. We made improvements to our employee benefit program while better aligning
incentives. We also established a new employee evaluation program and a number of web-
based tools to provide a framework for our employees’ continued
development. I believe these investments have been well-received
by our employees, who have been
pivotal in our efforts to enhance the customer experience.
We also followed through on our commitment to shareholders. In 2011,
we laid out a disciplined plan to return 25 percent of our operating cash flows to shareholders, and we exceeded that target by returning more than 28 percent. In addition to this increased return to investors, we completed attractive acquisitions and improved our financial position. We also continue
to make the necessary investments in the business to support our long-term growth objectives. By any measure, our record-setting cash flows of $549 million from continuing operations provided us many opportunities to enhance value in 2011.

                           Clear Operational Objectives
A core element of our growth strategy is consistent value creation. For that reason, in 2012 we will continue our focus on the three core operating objectives that I believe are essential to our long-term success;
123
   Establishing organic growth within Long-Term Care;
Repositioning Specialty Care Group for accelerated growth; and
Increasing standardization throughout the company.
We have already made significant progress towards achieving these objectives, and I believe 2012 will see Omnicare fulfill our potential even more extensively.
       Establishing Organic Growth within Long-Term Care
We have a good start on building organic growth in Long-Term Care. We predicted we would turn several years of attrition into net organic bed growth within 18-24 months, and we achieved this goal ahead of schedule. With our people galvanized by a revived company culture, customer satisfaction has improved, demonstrated by a 330 basis-point, year-over-year increase in our customer retention rate in 2011. In fact, we exited the year with our highest quarterly retention rate in the past 5 years. We are also investing in the sales component of our business to boost organic bed growth even further.
In order to accelerate our selling effectiveness, I believe it is essential that prospective customers
fully understand the value of our offering, which is defined by our clinical expertise, our speed-to-generic
conversion, and our innovative customer-facing technology. We are focused on ensuring this message is being appropriately delivered by our expanding sales force in a way that resonates with prospective customers. After all, these elements can create significant efficiencies for our customers, making Omnicare a valuable partner. The more our customers utilize these key services, the more value they can create for their businesses.
The value proposition of our Long-Term Care Group is more compelling than ever, especially in an environment where every healthcare company has
a role to play in reducing the rate of increase for our country’s healthcare spending. The more effective we are at conveying the value we bring to our facilities’ customers and their residents, the more effective I believe we will be at delivering organic growth in our Long-Term Care Group.

Repositioning Specialty Care Group for Accelerated Growth
Our Specialty Care Group has become a significant growth driver and, we believe, is in a great position
to continue on its trajectory, in part due to favorable market conditions. New large molecule compounds targeting complex patient needs, for example, are driving substantial potential for growth in the specialty drug market.
Our Specialty Care Group delivered 24 percent top- line growth in 2011, outpacing the market and gaining share. This fast-growing division now represents more than 15 percent of our entire business, and we now provide more detailed financial information about our Specialty Care Group in our public filings. We began reporting this business as its own segment in 2011 with the goal of providing greater financial transparency

to make it easier for shareholders to understand the impact of this growing division.
To maximize potential within the Specialty Care Group, we have created five specific operating platforms for growth: (1) brand support services; (2) supply chain solutions; (3) patient support services; (4) specialty pharmacy and; (5) pharmacy management for end of life care. We are particularly energized by the former three platforms since they support the most rapidly growing area within the pharmaceutical supply channel and help us diversify our revenue base. These fee-for-service platforms provide key commercialization services to our manufacturer clients, while positively affecting adherence to complicated and life-saving therapies. Collectively,
our specialty care platforms are expanding rapidly, and I believe these businesses will continue to grow as the investments made in 2011 begin to take hold.

                                                                                  Increasing Standardization Throughout the Company
Omnicare’s legacy of operating multiple units independently provides substantial opportunities
for greater efficiency and value creation through standardization. We are focused, in particular, on standardizing our pharmacy operations. While we are committed to localized, personal service that meets our customers’ individual needs, our goal is to ensure that our operations are 60-70 percent standardized. We believe this will position us to develop best practices, reduce cost, improve accuracy and enhance the overall customer experience.
A key driver for standardization is pharmacy automation. We believe we have strengthened our own business while significantly impacting the industry with automated technologies like Auto-Label-Verify (ALV) and Universal-Label-Verify (ULV). ALV is a proprietary and patent pending automated dispensing system that has exceeded Six-Sigma quality by dispensing over
70 million picks with perfect accuracy. We expect to
continue the roll-out of additional ALV units into more hub pharmacies during 2012. ULV is a validate-able dispensing technology that will expand the number of product formats at both hub and local pharmacies. Together, we believe ALV and ULV offer tremendous value for both Omnicare and our customers. Both technology systems will significantly reduce dispensing costs, while providing the highest accuracy and improved service.
We are also piloting customer-facing automation to provide facility customers with additional value. Our proprietary in-facility automated dispensing machine provides instant access to a wide range of prescribed medications, significantly reducing the turnaround time it takes for a newly admitted resident to receive the necessary medication. Moreover, by dispensing drugs immediately, this medication availability solution also eliminates many costly “stat” runs from the pharmacy to the facility. As we leverage our OmniviewDr proprietary physician portal for electronically prescribed medications along with this equipment,
A key driver for standardization is pharmacy automation.

                 which includes controlled substances, we believe we will significantly improve the quality of care. There has been a growing demand within our customer base for this type of solution, and we are pleased to begin fulfilling that need in 2012.
We are also advancing standardization by moving from two separate billing and dispensing systems
to one state-of-the-art platform, which will create efficiencies across the organization, supporting and streamlining our financial, billing, and dispensing operations. I believe the efficiencies generated by this new system, coupled with the operating improvements driven by our automation initiatives, will increase the level of standardization across the company, bringing long-term benefits to our company, our customers and our shareholders.
Maximizing Value from the Profitable Wave of Generics
Patents on a number of important brand name drugs expire over the next few years. Because our scale enables us to buy medications directly from manufacturers, we believe we are poised to realize
Pharmaceutical Market Dynamics
Continued Rise in New Generic Introductions
a greater benefit from this wave of generics than
our competitors, who buy from wholesalers or
other intermediaries. Because of the differentiated opportunity generic drugs bring to Omnicare, I believe we are fully aligned with our customers and payers: As we benefit from generic alternatives, they do, too.
The benefits we bring by converting customers to newly launched generic drugs are augmented by the rapid speed at which we affect conversion. While it often takes others weeks or months to convert nearly all incoming scripts to a newly launched generic alternative, it typically takes Omnicare only a matter of days. This efficiency drives incremental savings to our customers, who I believe will appreciate the Omnicare value proposition more during this important period for new generic introductions.
Our efficiency with lower cost generic alternatives represents a compelling opportunity for both our shareholders and customers. As we continue to become more operationally driven, I believe we will increase the industry standard for generic drug efficiencies even further.

                  Realizing Outstanding Cash Flow Value
Omnicare’s robust cash flow characteristics provide us with a distinct opportunity to drive value for our shareholders. As always, we will maintain a balanced and disciplined approach as we execute on our capital allocation objectives.
Trends Point to Outstanding Value Creation in 2012
2011 was a solid year in which we delivered significant returns on our investments across the organization. We became more unified, more focused, more aligned
and more profitable. With the outstanding opportunities in generics and in specialty
care, I am excited about the prospects for Omnicare’s growth, and I am confident in our ability to outperform the market. Our investments in technology, in
operations and in our sales organization have already yielded positive results, while
enhancing the underlying growth opportunities for our
two core businesses.
The strong foundation we laid in 2011 positions Omnicare well for 2012
and beyond. I knew the company I joined at the start of 2011 had tremendous potential for value creation on every horizon, and we believe that we have just begun to see that potential realized. In 2012, I believe we will accelerate the positive trends of last year, positioning the company for long-term profitable growth. On behalf of all of Omnicare’s dedicated employees, we look forward to sharing our progress with you over the coming months and years.
John Figueroa
Chief Executive Officer
 Beginning with our commitment to returning a minimum of 25 percent of cash flows from operations to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, we also have sufficient cash flows to
maintain a disciplined pursuit
of high-quality acquisitions,
make capital investments to support our long-term growth objectives, and continue to
make improvements to our capital structure.
To better show the strength of our cash flow, this year we will transition to an adjusted cash-based reporting methodology. Not only do I believe this will enhance our investors’ understanding of the company’s financial position, but it is consistent with our goal of creating greater transparency throughout Omnicare.
