>> To Our Shareholders
In 2005, Tyson Foods, Inc. continued to execute our business strategy to create more value-added products, improve operational efficiencies and expand our international business. This year Tyson Foods moved from the S&P MidCap 400 to the S&P 500 Index. This is a milestone for the Company. The 500 stocks selected by Standard & Poor's are leading U.S. companies in leading industries. It is a benchmark of overall stock market performance, and we believe we are a strong representative of the food industry. Tyson Foods is the world's largest protein company. We power America by producing nearly one out of every four pounds of the chicken, beef and pork Americans eat. Tyson is the only company selling all three proteins through all major distribution channels. We lead domestic chicken production with a 26 percent market share and domestic beef production with a 26 percent market share. We hold the number two position in the pork segment with an 18 percent market share.* In the first full year of our Powered by Tyson campaign, we spent $125 million on the most comprehensive marketing effort in our company's 70 year history. The investment is paying off. More people now identify the Tyson brand with beef and pork and are interested in the products we offer in all three proteins. With pork, Tyson is already the second leading brand in awareness. We will continue our Powered by Tyson marketing efforts in 2006. You'll see Tyson ads on television, in magazines and on the Internet throughout the year with product-specific and market-specific advertising. Value-Added Products Value-added products represented 42.7 percent of our sales, or $11.1 billion, in 2005, a $500 million increase over 2004. We are focused on creating more value-added products, especially with beef and pork. Our goal is to increase sales of valueadded products to $12 billion in 2006. To drive growth, we are enhancing our current product lines, expanding existing categories and creating new product lines.

Tyson is the market leader in value-added frozen chicken products. We still bring innovative products to this category, which we created decades ago. We have an approximate 60 percent market share of bagged fully-cooked frozen chicken and a 40 percent share for boxed products. Sales volume in this category increased 26 percent in 2004 and 23 percent in 2005. We are taking our knowledge in value-added chicken and applying it to beef and pork. Value-added beef and pork products led to market share growth in both the foodservice and consumer products distribution channels. Bacon sales were up 37 percent over the previous year. Tyson is now the number two bacon marketer in the United States. Refrigerated dinner meats sales were up 30 percent and refrigerated chicken and steak strips sales were up 932 percent. We increased distribution of case-ready beef and pork, resulting in our fourth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth. To meet growing demand, we are adding our third case-ready facility, which is scheduled to begin production in February 2006. When fully operational, it will increase our capacity by one-third and allow us to serve our growing case-ready customer base.

Along with new products, we add value for our customers with service. In the past few years, we implemented an account team approach, providing one face to the customer for all three proteins. In the consumer products channel, we have 14 teams in place to serve our largest retail and club store accounts. In foodservice, we have 26 teams to serve our largest chain restaurant accounts and broadline distributors. Account teams increase our ability to deliver our full portfolio of products and services to customers. We support our customers' growth through operations planning. We dedicated four more plants to making products exclusively for some of our largest customers. We grow with customers to provide as much volume as they need, when they need it. Operational Efficiencies Striving to operate more efficiently and maintain our best cost management practices is the second part of our business strategy. Over the past two years, we maintained or increased capacity and market share while closing or consolidating seven plants. Our on-going improvement programs make our processing

plants and products safer, increase efficiencies, improve yields, improve Team Member safety and control operating costs. We spent $302 million in 2005 for cost savings and income producing projects expected to save more than $84 million per year. In 2006, we plan to spend approximately $232 million for a projected annual savings of $72 million and to deliver a 3 percent cost reduction of $14 million from our shared services budget. International Expanding our international business is a fundamental part of Tyson Foods' future growth. As our global customers' businesses grow outside the United States, we grow with them. To support their growth and ours, we are looking for in-country production opportunities through joint ventures or acquisitions. Our key areas of interest continue to be China, Mexico, Canada and South America. This year has been especially challenging for international beef exports. While we maintained our focus on developing sales in all available markets, we supported the U.S. government's activities to renew exports to Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. These bans resulted in a loss of an estimated $800 million in beef export sales in fiscal 2005. We are encouraged by recent developments in export market access, but fiscal 2006 will present only gradual recovery in beef as those markets stabilize and cattle supplies improve.

Although export bans affected beef sales the entire fiscal year, we generated international business through increased sales and by expanding our export customer base for chicken products. By developing market-specific products, we increased domestic sales in China. We increased processing capacity at Tyson de Mexico and will boost live production in fiscal 2006. We also plan to increase our in-country presence in at least one foreign market in 2006. Financial Performance We generated strong cash flow in fiscal 2005. We paid down debt by $367 million. We set a debt-to-capital ratio goal of 40 percent for the end of the year, and we reached our goal ahead of schedule in the third quarter. We are satisfied with our current debt level because it gives us the flexibility to use our cash for other priorities. Our capital spending in 2006 should be $600 million to $650 million as we continue work on the new Discovery Center and fund other projects to increase operational efficiencies and support value-added product growth. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the 52-week 2005 fiscal year were $0.99 compared to $1.13 in the 53-week 2004 fiscal year, a decrease of 12.4 percent. Sales were $26.0 billion in 2005, compared to $26.4 billion in 2004. We didn't meet our goal of achieving annual double-digit EPS growth because

structure for the Company. We made these modifications following an internal organization development process and consultation with the Board of Directors. I am pleased to announce Scott Ford has joined our Board of Directors. Scott is the president and chief executive officer of ALLTEL. He will bring the important perspective of a CEO from a strong stockholder focused company in another consumer products business segment. Our Core Values are the basis for how we lead our business. In this annual report you'll see how Tyson Foods is powered by our Core Values and our business strategy. We are confident in our strategy and the people who execute it.

our beef operations were affected by lower domestic cattle supplies, restrictions on Canadian cattle imports and limited access to international markets. However, we had improved margins in our chicken business, and our pork business showed improvement in the fourth quarter. Market conditions were challenging this year and may continue to be a challenge in 2006. We are confident in our ability to manage through the tough times for the benefit of the Company and our shareholders. We expect earnings for 2006 to be in the range of $0.95 to $1.25 per share. People We have an on-going commitment to develop the people of Tyson Foods. Near the end of the fiscal year, we made organizational changes in our management structure, and many people have new or expanded responsibilities. This is part of our plan to create opportunities for Team Members while we develop the people who will someday lead the Company. We modified the structure of some of the senior management teams reporting to Dick Bond, president and chief operating officer, Greg Lee, chief administrative officer and international president, and myself. We firmly believe these changes will result in a more effective management
