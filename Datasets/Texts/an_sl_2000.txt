April 9, 2001 To Our Shareholders: By nearly every measure, 2000 will be remembered as a watershed year for AutoNation. On a pro forma basis, full-year earnings per share jumped 27% to 84 cents on income from continuing operations of $303 million, versus 66 cents per share on income from continuing operations of $289 million in 1999. But the story behind the numbers is equally compelling. During the year, we completed the closure of the former used vehicle megastores, spun off the automotive rental group, sold most of our non-retail assets and reduced expenses by $100 million. In brief, we transformed AutoNation from a collection of unrelated business divisions into a company with a clear focus: to be America's largest and most-valued pure-play automotive retailer. By focusing the company in 2000, we have set the stage to perform well in a challenging new vehicle market in 2001. And we believe we have positioned ourselves to achieve our annual earnings-per-share growth target of 10 to 12% each year thereafter. To achieve these results, AutoNation will execute a strategic plan that extends its leadership in new vehicles and leverages its scale to generate margin growth in such key areas as used vehicles, parts and service, finance and insurance, and collision repair. We outline this strategy later in this report. But first, let's review our 2000 financial performance.

2000: A Watershed Year
Revenue in 2000 increased 7% to $20.6 billion, excluding the impact of the former used vehicle megastores. The growth in revenue came despite the slowdown in auto sales that hit most retailers late in 2000, while the significant improvement in earnings per share reflected the improved efficiency of our operations. The fact that AutoNation delivered record net income for the fourth quarter of 2000 suggests that the company is positioned to perform well ­ even in a challenging retail environment.

Also during 2000, AutoNation cemented its position as the leading online automotive retailer by generating more than $1.5 billion of vehicle sales via the Internet. The year was filled with other signposts of success. During 2000, AutoNation: · Grew earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) 25% to $892 million, giving us tremendous financial flexibility · Improved fourth quarter same-store operating margins by 70 basis points to an industry-leading 5% versus 4.3% at the same time last year · Cut corporate overhead 34% versus 1999 and 44% versus the run rate in fourth quarter 1999 · Sold more than one million cars and light trucks, including fleet sales, for the second consecutive year During the year, AutoNation used its cash flow to upgrade and acquire dealerships, retire more than $300 million of long-term debt and to repurchase $189 million worth of our shares, or 7% of our shares outstanding. The fact that AutoNation generated this financial performance while simultaneously re-focusing its energy on becoming a pure-play automotive retailer is a tribute to the talent and energy of our 31,000 employees.

Building on Success in 2001
How do we build on this success? First, we leverage our sustainable competitive advantages. Then, we enhance this performance with a solid growth plan. What are those advantages? The first would undoubtedly be our scale. AutoNation is the largest competitor in one of the largest retail categories in America: the nearly $1 trillion market that comprises the sale, financing, servicing and repair of new and used vehicles. On average, we retail about 2,300 cars every day, and we service another 25,000 vehicles as well. On a revenue basis, AutoNation is more than three times larger than its nearest competitor and, in fact, is larger than all of the other publicly traded auto retailers combined. Measured against other public companies of all types, at #63 on the 2000 Fortune 500, AutoNation is one of the largest companies in America. That size gives AutoNation a sustainable competitive advantage in such key areas as cost of capital and volume purchasing on products and services like insurance, advertising and auto parts. Another advantage is the critical mass that we have achieved in many of the fastest growing markets in America. This includes great markets like Las Vegas, Phoenix, Dallas, Houston, Orlando, Tampa, Denver, Atlanta, Los Angeles and South Florida, among others. Our goal is to ensure that if you live or work in one of these markets, you cannot make an intelligent choice about buying or servicing your vehicle without considering one of our dealerships. Scale and critical mass go hand-in-hand. For example,

our large size in specific markets has enabled AutoNation to negotiate advertising rate reductions of as much as 40%. A third advantage is the fact that AutoNation has established framework agreements with all of the major automotive manufacturers. These agreements set the tone for long-term, mutually-rewarding relationships with our primary suppliers and provide a clear growth path.

The fourth competitive advantage is our strong balance sheet. With a non-vehicle debt-to-equity ratio of about 22%, AutoNation has the flexibility to take advantage of important growth opportunities as they arise.
AutoNation e-Commerce Network

And finally, AutoNation enjoys a leadership position in automotive e-Commerce, using the Web to sell more vehicles than any other automotive retailer. Our alliances with America Online and Microsoft's MSN Carpoint web site leverage our leadership position and our proprietary e-Commerce infrastructure by providing a continuous stream of high-quality sales leads for our company-owned dealerships and for dealers who subscribe to the AutoNation e-Commerce Network.
