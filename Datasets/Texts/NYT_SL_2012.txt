                                To our ShareholderS
2012 was a year during which we recast The New York Times Company for the challenges and opportunities of the future. In so doing, we significantly expanded our digital subscription base, divested of several noncore assets, remained disciplined on cost management and improved our financial position.
We also mourned the passing of my father, Arthur Ochs “Punch” Sulzberger who, I know you will agree, was a courageous man and one of our industry’s most admired executives.
Last year we faced uncertain and uneven economic conditions, and an increasingly difficult advertising climate. While we expect these challenges to continue, we have taken a number of steps to rebalance our business and better position our Company for the future.
The launch of our paid digital subscription model in 2011 has created a meaningful consumer revenue stream. In fact, 2012 marked the first time in our history that circulation revenues surpassed advertising revenues. This was in large part due to the significant growth in our digital subscription base, which at year-end totaled approximately 668,000 paying subscribers to the Company’s digital products.
We continue to seek and capitalize on opportunities to grow our brands and digital businesses
by broadening our audiences, deepening engagement and extending our global reach. Our key areas of focus include expanding our portfolio of paid digital products; growing our international footprint to leverage the strong salience of The Times brand; developing more strategic video capabilities; building on our mobile initiatives and expanding our conference and events business. As part of this plan, we recently announced that the International Herald Tribune will be rebranded the International New York Times.
Our business strategy will be supported by a strong balance sheet, which benefitted from the
sale over the past year of the Company’s Regional Media Group and About Group, and our
stakes in Fenway Sports Group and Indeed.com. The Regional Media Group brought great value
to our Company for many years and to the communities it served. Under the Times Company’s stewardship, its newspapers received four Pulitzer Prizes. The About Group, which was a valuable component of our digital portfolio with its early expertise in search engine optimization and expert content, had been a strong contributor to the Company since its acquisition in 2005. More recently we announced that we have begun a process to sell the New England Media Group. A sale will allow us to concentrate our strategic focus and investment on The New York Times brand and its journalism.
We will also continue to diligently manage our costs, even as we invest in our future. This includes working hard to maintain a sizable and robust newsgathering operation capable of continuing our tradition of excellent journalism, a pursuit that now more than ever sets us apart.
There has been considerable and understandable interest in our cash position and capital allocation plans, particularly on the question of returning cash in the form of a dividend. Our main priorities
in evaluating the uses of cash will be investing to grow our business, returning to sustainable growth in revenue and profitability and looking for opportunities to further deleverage our balance sheet and reduce our exposure under our pension plans. Until we have made progress in these areas, we believe that it is in the best interests of the Company to maintain a conservative balance sheet and therefore we do not believe that this is the appropriate time to restore a dividend.
Last August, after a thorough search, our Board selected Mark Thompson as our new president and chief executive officer. He joined our Company and Board in mid-November.
It is an exciting appointment, as Mark brings a global perspective and more than 30 years of experience in the media industry, including extensive international business and management
  2012 annual report

                                expertise gained during his time as director-general of the BBC and as chief executive of Channel 4 Television Corporation. In addition, his experience in reshaping the BBC to meet the challenge of the digital age is highly valued as we continue to expand our business digitally and globally.
The Company also added to our Board two proven digital leaders, Joichi Ito and Brian McAndrews. Each of them brings extensive insight on the intersection of technology and content.
In all, we made significant progress in our digital transition. I am extremely proud of the efforts
of my colleagues throughout the organization from New York to Boston, from Paris to Hong Kong and all those working at every point in between. They have proven, even during this transformative and challenging time in the media industry, that they remain committed to providing our readers, subscribers and advertisers with the highest quality journalism.
In 2012, for the second consecutive year and only the third time in our history, newspapers at all three of our news groups — The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The Tuscaloosa News, which was part of our Company when the story ran — earned the most important prize in journalism, the Pulitzer. The Pulitzers awarded in 2012 were:
• David Kocieniewski of The Times for explanatory reporting for his series that penetrated a legal thicket to explain how the nation’s wealthiest citizens and corporations often exploited loopholes and avoided taxes.
• Jeffrey Gettleman of The Times for international reporting for his vivid reports on famine and conflict in East Africa, a neglected but increasingly strategic part of the world.
• Wesley Morris of The Boston Globe for criticism for his smart, inventive film criticism, distinguished by pinpoint prose and an easy traverse between the art house and the big-screen box office.
• The Tuscaloosa News Staff for breaking news reporting for its enterprising coverage of a deadly tornado, using social media as well as traditional reporting to provide real-time updates, help locate missing people and produce in-depth print accounts even after power disruption forced the paper to publish at another plant 50 miles away.
We are also extremely proud of the three 2012 George Polk Awards The Times received: David Barboza for foreign reporting for his series, “Princelings,” which examined the financial interests of high-ranking Chinese officials and their families; Sam Dolnick for justice reporting for his series, “Unlocked,” which detailed widespread abuses at New Jersey’s privatized halfway houses; and David Barstow and freelance reporter Alejandra Xanic von Bertrab for business reporting for “Wal-Mart Abroad,” which showed how that company’s growth in Mexico was fueled by the payment of bribes that allowed the company to skirt Mexican laws.
We also said goodbye to several esteemed colleagues in 2012 and early 2013, including Scott Heekin- Canedy, president and general manager of The New York Times, who led The Times astutely and thoughtfully during his eight years in that role. We thank Scott and our other colleagues for their significant contributions to our Company.
With all we accomplished in 2012 we believe that our Company is well positioned to succeed in this evolving media landscape. We have sharpened our focus on our core business and will look to leverage The New York Times brand in new products, markets and endeavors in the coming year.
Arthur Sulzberger, Jr.
