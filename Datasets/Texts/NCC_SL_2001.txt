City National Corporation Officers
In sum, we continued to build City National’s capabilities and opportunities, its reputation and performance as California’s Premier Private and Business Bank.
Sustaining Solid Financial Performance
In 2001, City National again delivered double-digit growth in net income, which increased 11 percent to $146 million for the year.That brought our five-year compounded annual growth rate to 17 percent. Earnings per share were $2.96, a 9 percent increase over the prior year, for a five-year com- pounded growth rate of 15 percent. For the eighth straight year, the Board of Directors increased our dividend, declaring an annual rate of $0.78 per share, effective January 2002.
By year end, the corporation had achieved several milestones: Total assets surpassed $10 billion for the first time, total deposits exceeded $8 billion and total loans topped $7 billion.
Net interest income rose 7 percent to an all-time high of $434 million last year, even as interest rates fell dramatically. Average relationship loans increased 13 percent to $6.6 billion. Although a slowing economy moderated loan demand in certain sectors, our organization was able to attract significant new quality clients and generate quality growth in our portfolio and revenue.
Noninterest income, an important component of our ability to deliver recurring revenue and quality growth, rose 21 percent from $109 million to $132 million, thanks in part to the strength of our asset management and brokerage businesses. City National Investments ended 2001 with $18.8 billion in assets under management or administration. Assets under management grew 15 percent to $7.7 billion.
 To Our Shareholders,
We are pleased to report that, for the sixth consecutive year, City National Corporation has generated record earnings and achieved record levels of assets, loans, deposits and assets under management or administration.
In 2001, City National continued to build shareholder value by executing eight long-standing strategies for consistent, quality growth:
• Retaining and broadening relationships with our clients;
• Increasing the number of our top-tier client relationships;
• Growing noninterest income;
• Making focused and disciplined acquisitions;
• Maintaining good credit quality and risk management;
• Enhancing productivity by utilizing technology and controlling costs;
• Investing in the talent and leadership capabilities of our colleagues; and
• Maintaining a clear commitment to integrity and strong corporate
values.

Meanwhile, average deposits grew to $7.1 billion — a 12 percent gain. Average core deposits increased 13 percent to $5.6 billion, and average demand deposits rose 15 percent year over year to $3 billion. By December 31, 2001, demand deposits accounted for 42 percent of our average total—well above the industry average and nearly twice the level of peer banks. Our remarkably strong deposit base enables City National to sustain a net interest margin that is among the highest in the industry. In 2001, our margin remained strong.While the Federal Reserve Board’s rate reductions totaled 475 basis points, our average net interest margin for the year narrowed only 18 basis points to 5.26 percent.
Equally important, the company grew while building a stronger capital position. We reported total risk-based capital and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios for the year of 14.08 percent and 9.32 percent, respectively, well above the 10 percent and 6 percent ratio requirements for “well-capitalized” institutions. Our Tier 1 leverage ratio of 7.26 percent easily exceeded the 4 percent regulatory minimum required of “well-capitalized” institutions. During 2001, City National Bank further strengthened its Tier 2 capital position with the issuance of $150 million of 10-year subordinated notes at 6.75 percent.We also issued $3.4 million of preferred stock of a REIT subsidiary of the bank. This preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital.
Strengthening Relationships With New Capabilities
City National continues to strengthen client relationships through technol- ogy, geographic expansion and initiatives aimed at strengthening the diversity and delivery of our banking and wealth management products and services.

 Nurturing Quality Growth From Solid Roots
Technology enables us to deliver additional choice, convenience and value to our clients. In 2001, we introduced a product that has been particularly well received: City National Online Cash Management. We also launched City National’s Online Letters of Credit and Online Foreign Exchange products for the growing number of clients who are involved in international trade. These capabilities — combined with City National’s trademark personal service—are helping us to enhance client retention and profitability.
We continue to apply technology, innovation and expense control in ways that improve productivity and help us monitor and manage both profitability and business relationships.The numbers tell a compelling story: Our efficiency ratio improved to 54 percent in 2001. On a cash basis, it stood at 51 percent, compared with nearly 53 percent for the year 2000. Our average earning assets per colleague rose from $3.8 million in 2000 to $4.1 million in 2001, for a five-year compounded annual growth rate of 9 percent.
Last year, we continued to expand City National’s resources and market presence in the San Francisco Bay Area, opening our first commercial bank- ing office in the East Bay (Walnut Creek) and adding a seasoned team of outstanding professionals with strong skills, market expertise and a shared commitment to quality relationship banking.
On February 28, 2002, we completed the acquisition of Civic BanCorp. Civic is an excellent, highly focused commercial bank that serves several fast- growing Bay Area counties, including Alameda and Contra Costa. It has a base of clients in traditional California businesses such as manufacturing, distribution, wholesaling and professional services. Civic has no technology loans and a modest real estate construction portfolio.

Civic is a good “fit.” Its bankers share City National’s passion for strong client relationships and superior service.We are especially pleased that Civic’s very fine management team has joined City National.We have had consider- able success with our seven other bank acquisitions since 1995, in large part because of the addition and retention of their quality colleagues and clients.
This acquisition is another measured step in our effort to extend City National’s reach and critical mass in the Bay Area—a step that reflects our commitment to serve the growing and well established base of entrepre- neurs, professionals and middle-market companies in a region that is now the world’s 24th largest economy.
The Civic acquisition nearly doubles our assets in the Bay Area to approximately $1 billion and, following the integration process, brings the number of our banking offices in California to 53, including 11 full-service regional centers.
These regional centers continue to play a critical role in building our presence by delivering the full array of our capabilities and creating new opportuni- ties in our major markets. Each center combines branch banking, private banking, business banking and wealth management services in one City National location, providing clients with coordinated local access to our complete financial solutions through experienced professionals who know them, their businesses and their communities.
Growing Noninterest Income
Many clients come to City National for a single business or personal banking service, and then look to us for additional capabilities. One fact underscores this point: For several years, well over half of our company’s top-tier clients have been using products from four or more of our seven product categories.
Cultivating Opportunities in a Growing Market
Reaping the rewards of client satisfaction: Nearly one-third of new clients come to us through referral

Planting New Seeds of Growth
Investment management, trust, financial planning, cash management and international products are all important elements of our effort to expand client relationships and increase noninterest income.The revenue generated by these businesses reduces our exposure to interest-rate risk and provides additional sources of recurring, annuity-like income. Noninterest income now accounts for slightly more than 23 percent of our revenue. Our inter- mediate goal is to grow it to 35 percent.
At the heart of this effort is City National Private Client Services—a new evolutionary initiative designed to expand and enhance client relationships by integrating many of our private banking and wealth management capa- bilities.The first phase of this effort should be fully in place by the middle of 2002.Through Private Client Services, we are making the entire array of our financial solutions — banking, credit, investment management, trust and planning—more easily available to our key clients. Private Client Advisors will be available to manage investment-oriented relationships.
The opportunity is considerable.The number of wealthy California house- holds—those with investable assets of $1 million or more—now approaches 500,000. Together, they represent a $1.2 trillion market—one that is not dominated by any particular financial institution. As a result, we believe that City National has an especially attractive long-term opportunity to dramat- ically grow its private banking and wealth management businesses.
Our clients can obtain asset management services through City National Private Client Services or the Los Angeles-based firm of Reed, Conner & Birdwell, LLC, which we acquired in December 2000. In 2001, the inde- pendent value-oriented investment management firm generated an attractive return in a difficult year for the financial markets, and its assets under management grew 21 percent to $1.4 billion.
Strengthening our team of 2,200 colleagues by recruiting, training and retaining the finest talent in California’s financial services industry
Investing in technology and new products—like City National Online Cash Management—that further strengthen client service and colleague productivity

 As in the past, we will consider and seek focused acquisitions that enable us to expand and improve our wealth management and banking capabilities, provide opportunities to offer our products and services, and/or extend our reach further into strategic markets.
Focusing on Credit Quality
No strategy for quality growth would be complete without a strong com- mitment to credit quality and good risk management practices. We focus as intently on credit quality as on growth, and do not sacrifice the former to the latter. This disciplined approach served us well during last year’s economic slowdown.
At year-end 2001, the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and owned real estate stood at 0.54 percent compared with 0.96 percent at year-end 2000. Last year, the bank recorded a provision for credit losses of $35 million and remained well reserved at 2 percent of total loans.
The decline in nonperforming assets was principally the result of steps we took to dramatically reduce non-relationship syndicated loans. At year end, these loans accounted for approximately 1 percent of our entire loan portfolio.
Our relationship-based approach and our commitment to credit quality has enabled us to achieve and maintain comparatively low levels of nonper- forming assets while generating a five-year compounded annual rate of loan growth of 20 percent.
Our disciplined underwriting and credit review process is led by bankers with years of experience in managing credit quality in California. During the last six years, we have steadily diversified our lending portfolio through
geographic expansion, the introduction of new business lines and the growth of products like single-family mortgages. In addition, we link our bankers’ compensation to the quality of the loans they make, as judged over time, thus making all of our lenders active participants in the effort to safeguard City National’s credit quality.
In Summary
Despite an economic recession in the United States and much of the world, despite the biggest one-year interest-rate decline in U.S. history and despite the September 11 terrorist attacks that indelibly affected us all, City National Corporation posted record earnings in 2001 — for the sixth consecutive year.
We expanded our client relationships and product capabilities, enhanced our ability to serve selected markets throughout Southern California and the San Francisco Bay Area, kept a watchful eye on credit quality and further improved our productivity.
Our success stems from a value proposition that has flourished for nearly 50 years — one that combines exceptional service with a superior array of banking, trust and investment capabilities to produce complete financial solutions for a growing number of California entrepreneurs. It is this value proposition together with the strategies outlined above that have enabled City National to deliver consistent, quality earnings growth.
As we look to the future, we want to recognize three distinguished individ- uals who retired from our Boards of Directors in 2001. Ezunial Burts, Barry Meyer and Ed Sanders have made significant contributions to our success, and we are grateful for their service and counsel.

We are pleased to welcome to our Boards three outstanding individuals who bring considerable experience, expertise and judgment to our company. They are Ron Olson, partner at Munger, Tolles & Olson; Bill Richardson, former U.S. Secretary of Energy and Ambassador to the United Nations, who is now a senior managing director of Kissinger McLarty Associates; and Bob Tuttle, managing partner of Orange County-based Tuttle-Click Automotive Group.
We thank our many clients for their important relationships with City National, and commend our remarkable team of colleagues for the out- standing results they achieved again last year, not only for the company, its clients and shareholders, but also for the communities in which we live and work.
We want to acknowledge two colleagues, in particular: Jan Cloyde, the very effective Executive Vice President of Banking Services, who last year took on added responsibilities as a member of our senior-level Strategy and Planning Committee, and Mike Cahill, who joined our Executive Committee and became Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Jan and Mike are examples of the many remarkably talented and dedicated colleagues who can be found throughout our company.
Finally, we thank you, our fellow shareholders, for your continuing support and confidence. City National’s strong performance again last year demon- strates that the reliable execution of our time-tested strategies does deliver consistent, quality earnings growth. For this reason and more, we have every confidence that City National will continue to build shareholder value in the future.
