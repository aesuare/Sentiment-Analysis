Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive environment where our people thrive in their quest to deliver an exceptional customer experience.
To Our Shareholders
In the face of last year's unprecedented oil prices and the current economic crisis, it would be easy to get bogged down in the daily litany of bad news. One thing we've learned is -- just as in flying an airplane -- you have to climb above the clouds if you want a clear view of where you're heading. We are confident in our ability to weather the current storm. And we have not forgotten that over the long term we need to run our business in a way that always puts safety first, and that provides the best air travel value for our customers, excellent career opportunities for our employees, and a reasonable return on investment for our shareholders. If that sounds familiar, it should. While our short-term strategy varies with changes in our business environment, our long-term strategy does not. It is based on sound business principles that work.

To achieve our goals and build a company that produces lasting value for all stakeholders, some important things are required: relentless execution, a willingness to try new things, and a laserlike focus on controlling what we can control. And that includes the seemingly "uncontrollable" aspects of our business, such as inclement weather and volatile fuel prices, the effects of which we have been able to moderate through technology and careful risk management. Let's take a look at how we performed in 2008 as well as our goals for 2009 and beyond.

2008 Financial and Operational Results

In 2008 Alaska Air Group reported an adjusted net profit of $4.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Though far short of our plan, things would have been much worse had we not hedged a portion of our fuel needs and achieved consistent reductions in non-fuel unit costs at Alaska and Horizon over the past several years.

As airfares rose last year to cover the skyrocketing cost of fuel, we reduced planned capacity in the fourth quarter and -135.9 -150 for all of 2009. When the depth of the 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 global economic recession began to *(5.9) mil. after accounting change See reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted amounts on page 112. emerge, oil prices fell as precipitously as they had risen. Lower oil prices have provided welcome relief, but they are a byproduct of the recession, and demand for air travel has continued to decline. Because we had already planned to decrease capacity ­ albeit for a different reason ­ we were better prepared for the economic downturn.

In addition to taking seats out of our network, we shifted some capacity from under-performing and high-frequency markets to new, longer-haul routes, including Seattle-Minneapolis/St. Paul, Seattle-Maui and Seattle-Kona, which we began serving in 2008, and Portland-Maui and SeattleAustin, which we will inaugurate in 2009. We also retimed service in our Seattle-Los Angeles and Seattle-San Francisco markets to better serve our customers. 2008 also marked Horizon's first-ever foray south of the border as they began serving the Los Angeles-Loreto and Los Angeles-La Paz markets. We also announced two new Horizon routes: Los Angeles to Flagstaff and Prescott, Ariz., and Los Angeles to Mammoth Lakes, Calif. So far, we believe we've made the right cuts in the right markets, as evidenced by our relatively constant year-over-year load factors. The redeployment of capacity into new markets has brought important additional revenue into our network as demand in core markets has declined.

Improving Operations
In 2008, our key initiative was to improve our operation. Thanks to the hard work of employees around our system, we executed several projects that raised Alaska's on-time performance by six points and helped us achieve our customer satisfaction targets for eight straight months. At Horizon, our 83.1 percent on-time rating was a 2.4-point improvement over the prior year and would have earned us second place among all DOT reporting carriers, were we required to report. Projects that contributed to our operational gains included completion of the "Airport of the Future" terminal remodel at Seattle-Tacoma Airport to make the check-in process faster and easier for customers, implementation of the "Super A Check" to maintain Alaska's jets more efficiently, and process improvements in several other areas. At Horizon, year-over-year reliability improvements were also achieved through modifications to the Q400s and a highly successful project that used "Lean" techniques to significantly reduce the time and cost of maintenance heavy checks. In 2008, we also achieved our goal of a single Boeing 737 fleet type at Alaska, and we simplified Horizon's fleet from three types to two ­ Bombardier Q400 turboprops and CRJ700 regional jets. Ultimately, we plan to have a single fleet of Q400s at Horizon, giving both airlines the most fuelefficient aircraft available while streamlining maintenance, training and scheduling.

2008 Milestones
· · · Achieved our goal of a single 737 fleet type at Alaska. And at Horizon, reduced fleet to two aircraft types on our way to a single Q400 fleet. Significantly improved Alaskas' operation in Seattle and are now extending new processes throughout the rest of the system. Reached a long-term agreement with Delta, designating Alaska Airlines as the carrier's preferred partner on the West Coast. This agreement, together with our alliances with other important partners such as American Airlines, will give our customers greater access to a global network and position us for future growth. Achieved Alaska's unit cost goal of 7.5 cents, excluding fuel, in spite of reducing capacity. And Horizon finished the year slightly under the unit cost goal of 14.6 cents, also on reduced capacity.

Looking Ahead
We don't know how deep the recession will be or how long it will last. The economy is undergoing major structural change, and it is important that we continue adapting to the new realities. Our intent is to improve our competitive position and gain a bigger share of what, in the near term, will be a smaller travel market.

Last year, we moved our business forward through better planning and execution. We will apply those same skills to achieve our key initiative for 2009, which is to optimize revenue while sustaining the operational improvements we achieved in 2008. As part of that effort, we have embarked on an ad campaign showcasing the service our employees provide every day that's truly "North of Expected."

The most significant risks for 2009 and beyond are the level of customer demand and 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 the possible return of higher fuel prices. *Includes Frontier Jet Express flying under a capacity purchase agreement. Unit revenues and unit costs are lower for this flying than for the rest of Maintaining a relatively strong balance sheet Horizon's network. and a consistent fuel-hedging program are among our long-term objectives to guard against such risks. As of the end of 2008, our fuelhedging program had saved us just under a half billion dollars since 2002. We maintained our strong cash position, but we did so at the expense of additional debt, which increased our debt-to-capitalization ratio to 81 percent. While that's higher than we'd like it to be, we believe it is prudent to maintain a higher cash level in the near term.

This Is a `People' Business
People are the key to our success. Our business depends on customers choosing to fly our airlines and on our employees providing the level of service that makes customers want to come back again and again. We are asking a lot of our people and they are stepping up to the challenge. It is extremely gratifying that the friendly, caring service provided by our employees has been recognized by thousands of customers, as evidenced by J.D. Power and Associates ranking Alaska Airlines "Highest in Customer Satisfaction among Traditional Network Carriers (tie)" in its 2008 North America Airline Satisfaction StudySM.

We believe our relatively small size gives Alaska and Horizon natural advantages in ways that are critical to adapting to the changing environment. We are closer to our customers and can be more responsive to their changing needs. And our employees can align quickly around new objectives and provide important feedback that helps ensure the changes we make really do work. The legacies of both Alaska and Horizon are the result of hard-working people with varied backgrounds, experiences, perspectives and know-how. Guided by our deeply held values, our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive environment where our people thrive in their quest to deliver on our promise to provide an exceptional customer experience.

Leadership
And speaking of people, as our industry faces rapid changes and new challenges it is important that the leadership structure of our airline keeps pace. A strong focus on our longterm competitiveness and financial health is crucial. And sustaining the operational improvement we've made over the last year is necessary to continue delivering a level of service that customers prefer. In December 2008, former Alaska Air Group Chief Financial Officer Brad Tilden was named president of Alaska Airlines. Brad and Horizon Air President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Pinneo will lead the operating subsidiaries as I devote more time to guiding Alaska Air Group's strategy and financial performance and meeting our responsibilities to employees, customers and shareholders. We have a new chief financial officer, Glenn Johnson, who is a 26-year Alaska and Horizon veteran. And Ben Minicucci was promoted to chief operating officer of Alaska. We have a tradition of recognizing and developing natural talent, and I couldn't be more pleased to have proven leaders of their caliber in these roles.

Critical Leadership Behaviors at Alaska and Horizon

Principles
I am reminded of some "words to live by" that seem especially relevant right now: S S S S Don't buy things you can't afford. Don't borrow money you can't pay back. Don't agree to things you don't understand. If it doesn't seem right, it probably isn't.

These basic principles probably sound a lot like something your parents or grandparents told you, but they have helped us avoid pitfalls in the past and will guide our future decisions.

There is much uncertainty in today's economy, and the short term is going to be difficult for all businesses. We are pleased with the progress we've made, and we're very optimistic about our long-term prospects because of the outstanding people at Alaska and Horizon who are driving our success. Sincerely,

William S. Ayer Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Alaska Air Group April 1, 2009
