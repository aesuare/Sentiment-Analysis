John Stumpf, President and CEO

To our owners
In 2008 Wells Fargo earned a profit of $2.7 billion, or 70 cents per share. Revenue increased 6 percent to $41.90 billion. Average earning assets rose 17 percent. Average loans rose 16 percent. Average core deposits were up 7 percent. Since mid-2007, even as credit markets contracted and many of our competitors retrenched, we were an engine of growth for the U.S. economy. We made more than a half a trillion dollars in new loan commitments and mortgage originations -- $540 billion. We achieved the highest total shareholder return among all our peers -- and remained one of the world's strongest financial institutions. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. has the highest credit rating currently given to U.S. banks by Moody's Investors Service, "Aa1," and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, "AA+." Our Board increased Wells Fargo's dividend by 10 percent -- the 21st consecutive year our Company increased its dividend, exceeding $4.3 billion -- and maintained our dividend in first quarter 2009.

This performance is all the more remarkable because our talented team achieved it during the sharpest, most volatile, painful economic downturn our country has experienced in more than a quarter century. We made some mistakes but kept our credit discipline. We took several actions to further strengthen our balance sheet as we completed the merger of Wells Fargo and Wachovia -- to lay the foundation for the future growth of our combined company. One was to take a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter to add $5.6 billion to our credit reserves -- money we set aside to cover future estimated loan losses. This includes a $3.9 billion provision to conform reserving policies to the most conservative practices of both companies. This is in addition to building our reserves earlier in 2008 by $2.5 billion for possible future credit losses. We ended the year with an allowance for credit losses of $21.7 billion, or $3.20 for every dollar of our loans that were not accruing interest.* We further strengthened our balance sheet by taking a $37.2 billion write-down on $93.9 billion of higher-risk loans from Wachovia. We also reduced the risk of future charges to earnings from Wachovia's securities portfolio by $9.6 billion. These write-downs of loans and securities and other actions related to the Wachovia acquisition reduced our reported Tier 1 capital by about 230 basis points. Tier 1 capital is a core regulatory measure of a bank's financial strength -- the ratio of a bank's core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets. At year end our Tier 1 ratio was 7.84 percent. That's well above regulatory minimums for a well-capitalized bank. Emerging even stronger We believe the true test of a financial services company -- its vision, business model, culture and people -- is not when times are good. It's when times are not so good. When the tide goes out. We emerged from 2008 even stronger, ready for even more market share growth. That's because we stayed faithful to our vision of satisfying all our credit-worthy customers' financial needs and helping them succeed financially -- a vision we've been making steady progress toward for more than 20 years, through virtually every economic cycle. This vision does not require any complex mathematical models. All we do is try to create the best customer experience and then keep count: How many financial products do our customers have with us, and how can we earn all their business? Combining Wells Fargo and Wachovia Firmly grounded in our vision, we earned even more business from our more than 40 million customers in 2008. Because of our financial performance, capital strength, liquidity, credit discipline and earnings, we also were able to seize an unprecedented opportunity to satisfy all the financial needs of at least 30 million more customers. Our merger with Wachovia Corporation, completed December 31, 2008, has created the United States' premier coast-to-coast community banking presence, the most extensive distribution system of any financial services company across North America -- 11,000 stores, 12,300 ATMs, wellsfargo.com and Wells Fargo Phone
* At 12/31/08, our allowance for credit losses excluded $12.0 billion of Wachovia's allowance for credit-impaired loans, and nonaccrual loans excluded $20.0 billion that Wachovia had reported as nonaccrual.

Bank. Our combined company is #1 in mortgage lending, agricultural lending, small business lending, middle market commercial banking, asset-based lending, commercial real estate lending, commercial real estate brokerage and bankowned insurance brokerage. We're #2 in deposits, mortgage servicing, and debit card. We believed this merger was a compelling value the day we announced the agreement. We like it even more now. The integration is on schedule and proceeding as planned. In late 2008 loan officers from both Wells Fargo and Wachovia again carefully reexamined Wachovia's entire loan portfolio. We're comfortable overall with the credit assumptions we made when we agreed to acquire Wachovia October 3, 2008, without government assistance. We're confident we can reduce the combined company's expenses by 10 percent, or $5 billion, by the end of 2010 and achieve an internal rate of return of 20 percent. Building our house We did not, however, merge with Wachovia just to get bigger. Size alone means nothing to us. You may have noticed: Nowhere above do I mention how big our combined company is in assets. Where we rank in asset size alone is meaningless to us. That's because we did this merger to get better. In fact, to our customers, bigness can be a barrier. I've yet to hear of a customer walking into one of our banks and saying, "I want to bank here because you're so ... big!" Safe, secure and stable, yes. Friendly, hometown and approachable, yes. Smart, savvy, ethical, yes. But not just because we're big. As we like to say: You don't get better by getting bigger, you get bigger by getting better. So, we're approaching this merger not as if we're building an empire but as if we're building a home -- into which we can welcome our customers so we can have conversations they find of value about their hopes and dreams and financial goals. It took only 90 days from definitive agreement to official merger at the end of 2008. It will take much more time to fully blend the cultures of our two companies, combine businesses and products and systems, and name-change where needed. Just as we did with the very successful Norwest-Wells Fargo merger a decade ago, we're taking our time to do it right. We're putting our customers first, not the calendar. We're beginning every discussion with what's best for our customers and our team members -- focusing first not on the bottom line but the top line. This may sound odd to some people, but we don't believe our first job is to make a lot of money. Our first job is to understand our customers' financial objectives, their true financial needs, then offer them products and services to help satisfy those needs so they can be financially successful. If we do that right, then all sorts of good things happen for all our stakeholders, and we'll be able to produce industryleading returns for our shareholders. Based on this vision, the Wells Fargo-Wachovia team is building something together that we couldn't have built separately. We're building what we believe can become the premier financial services company not just in America but in the world. We're building not just for the next quarter but for generations to come.

1On 12/31/08, Wells Fargo & Company acquired Wachovia Corporation (Wachovia). Because the acquisition was completed at the end of 2008, Wachovia's results are not included in the income statement, average balances or related metrics for 2008. Wachovia's assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheet at 12/31/08, at their respective acquisition date fair values. 2Noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). 3Total revenue less noninterest expense. 4Noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing checking, savings certificates, market rate and other savings, and certain foreign deposits (Eurodollar sweep balances). 5Total core deposits excluding Wholesale Banking core deposits and retail mortgage escrow deposits. To reflect the realignment of our corporate trust business from Community Banking into Wholesale Banking in 2008, the balance for 2007 has been revised. 6Due to the Wachovia acquisition closing on 12/31/08, the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which considers period-end Tier 1 capital and quarterly average assets in the computation of the ratio, does not reflect average assets of Wachovia for the full period. 7Includes Wachovia team members at 12/31/08.

Keeping talent In this merger, as always in our company, people come first. A major test of our success in this merger is how much talent we can keep because the talent of our people is our product. We're a service company, and our team members are the biggest influence on our customers. Enthusiastic, loyal, satisfied team members create enthusiastic, loyal, satisfied customers who want to stay with us for a lifetime. That is why we call them "team members" (an asset in which to invest), not "employees" (an expense to be managed). Many people think they have to change companies or careers every five years to be successful. We're contrarians -- we value loyalty. We believe that the longer talented team members stay with us, the more they can use their skill, knowledge and experience to benefit our customers. In a merger this big and complex (it makes us one of America's top 10-largest private employers, with 281,000 team members), some positions have to be eliminated because they're duplicated or because they no longer fit the new structure as we combine businesses and functions. Inevitably, this causes disruption and uncertainty for those team members whose positions are eliminated due to the merger. Just because a position is eliminated, however, doesn't necessarily mean the team member in that position has to leave the company. To keep as much talent as possible, we've paused in most of our external recruiting and external hiring so we can help give team members displaced by the merger the chance to search for other exciting opportunities in our company. We're a growth company. We have thousands of open jobs in our company. We're adding them every day -- in our banks, our mortgage company, in investments and insurance and many of our other businesses. More alike than different The past several months I've had the privilege of meeting and getting to know many thousands of Wachovia team members in my visits to Charlotte, Winston-Salem, Columbia (South Carolina), Richmond, Atlanta, Miami, Jacksonville, Birmingham, Houston, Dallas, Summit (New Jersey), Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Boston, New York City, St. Louis, Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area. I've found them to be just like our Wells Fargo team members -- friendly, caring, sincere, very much committed to their customers and communities. We've had different systems, processes and ways of doing things, but from the customer point of view I believe we're much more alike than we're different. This is one of our great advantages as we integrate our two companies. Each company began at opposite ends of the country -- Wells Fargo tracing its legacy to 1852, Wachovia to 1781 -- but in the last few months we've discovered how much we have in common and how much we can learn from each other. We both believe community banking is a noble calling -- the opportunity to help people be financially successful, be a catalyst for economic growth in our communities and still earn a fair profit. By instinct and habit we both begin every discussion with what's best for our customers and communities. We both want every customer to say, "Wow, I didn't know I

"We're approaching the merger of Wells Fargo and Wachovia not as if we're building an empire but as if we're building a home -- into which we can welcome our customers so we can have conversations they find of value about their hopes and dreams and financial goals."
could get service like that. She made a difference. He solved my problem and helped me understand how I can achieve my goals. I learned something new about my financial health." We're very proud of the communities in which we live and work, and we want our companies to be known as leaders in making them even better places to live and work. In our Annual Report this year, beginning on page 10, we introduce you to 13 team members from Wells Fargo and 13 team members from Wachovia, each working in the same business or similar geography to satisfy all our customers' financial needs and help them succeed financially. These great team members are living proof: We're much more alike than we're different. Our national scope Our name remains Wells Fargo, our vision and values remain unchanged, our corporate headquarters remains in San Francisco, but the talent and resources of our company are more broadly dispersed across North America than ever before. Several metro areas across the country have significant concentrations of businesses, functions and employment for our company. Des Moines is national headquarters for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and global headquarters for Wells Fargo Financial. Our credit card business has significant concentrations in Des Moines, Concord (California), Beaverton (Oregon), and Sioux Falls (South Dakota). Minneapolis-St. Paul is headquarters for 18 national businesses including Wells Fargo Insurance (consumer), Institutional Trust, Equipment Finance, Municipal Finance and SBA Lending. Chicago is our national headquarters for Wells Fargo Insurance Services (commercial). Los Angeles is headquarters for 15 national businesses including U.S. Corporate Banking, Commercial Real Estate Lending, Community Real Estate Lending, International Financial Services, Wells Capital Management and Foothill Capital. Three important centers of employment and expertise from Wachovia now join this national group of "hubquarters" for Wells Fargo. Charlotte, North Carolina -- Wachovia's former corporate headquarters -- is now Wells Fargo's headquarters for Eastern Community Banking. It's also home to more than a dozen of our company's senior business heads in Wealth

Management and Retirement Services, Commercial Banking, Investment Banking, Mortgage, Card Services, and Technology and Operations. St. Louis is headquarters for Wachovia Securities, retail broker. Boston is headquarters for Wachovia's Evergreen Investments, asset management. Our 2008 performance In addition to the achievements I mentioned at the beginning, we also built the foundation for future growth of our combined company with these achievements in 2008: · Our revenue grew 6 percent, and our expenses declined one percent -- the best such revenue/expense ratio among our large peers, and the one we consider the best long-term measure of a company's efficiency. Our return on equity (after-tax profit for every shareholder dollar) was 4.79 cents for every dollar of our shareholders' equity, best among our large peers. To help finance the Wachovia acquisition, we issued 422.7 million shares of common stock valued at $12.5 billion at year-end. Excluding initial public offerings, this was the largest single issue of common stock in U.S. history. The enthusiastic response to this offering in a very difficult market again showed broad investor confidence in our long-term growth potential, time-tested vision and diversified business model. Our average Retail Banking household had a record 5.73 products with us (5.5 in 2007; 3.8 in 2001), and one of every four has eight or more products with us. We added 6.2 percent net new checking accounts -- a core product that if our customers have with us makes them much more inclined to come to us for their next financial services product. More than half our new Business Banking checking customers bought a package of products from us when they opened their accounts -- such as a business debit card, credit card, or a business loan or line of credit. Our average Wholesale Banking customer had a record 6.4 products per relationship with us; a record 7.8 products per Commercial Banking customer relationship. Average core deposits from our Wealth Management customers rose $7 billion, up 40 percent; Private Banking average core deposits rose 38 percent.

·

We originated $230 billion in mortgages, and our owned-mortgage servicing portfolio was $2.1 trillion (including Wachovia), up 39 percent from last year. Our most-used channel, wellsfargo.com, had a blockbuster year -- product "solutions" sold up 29 percent, total active online customers surpassed 11 million, up 15 percent, active consumer Bill Pay customers up 16 percent to two million, and we introduced the vSafe personal online safe for protecting and storing important documents.

Besides Wachovia, we acquired the banking operations of United Bancorporation of Wyoming, Flatiron Credit Company (insurance premium finance), Farmers State Bank (Morgan, Colorado), Century Bancshares (Dallas-Fort Worth; Texarkana, Texas and Arkansas) and EMAR Group (commercial insurance). Our team members as a whole are happier in their work than ever before. In Community Banking, home to about one of every three of them, the ratio of engaged to actively disengaged team members was 8.7 to 1 (2.5 to 1 five years ago) versus a national average of 1.5 to 1. Our most senior bankers -- market presidents, district managers and regional presidents -- are more engaged than about nine of every 10 work groups Gallup surveys. The $25 billion investment by the U.S. Treasury in Wells Fargo preferred stock in fourth quarter 2008 gives our company more resources and greater confidence to make more loans to credit-worthy customers. Our new lending in the fourth quarter 2008 alone was almost three times the government investment. In February 2009 we paid a quarterly dividend of $371.5 million to the U.S. Treasury on its Wells Fargo investment.

Lending discipline We've said it for years and we'll say it again because it's never been more important: Our #1 financial goal is to have a conservative financial structure as measured by asset quality, capital levels, diversity of revenue sources and dispersing risk by geography, loan size and industry. True to that and unlike many of our competitors we actually built capital and shrunk our balance sheet in 2005 and 2006, well before credit markets began to contract in 2008. We understood our customers' financial needs. As a result, our company is one of the world's strongest financial institutions. Even as credit markets contracted in 2008, we still led the

"We're not satisfied with just being #1 in deposit market share. We want to be known as the best in every product in every market in which we do business, in retail banking, business banking, investments and mortgage -- and be the first provider our customers think of when they need their next financial product."

industry in lending to credit-worthy customers. We made more loans at better price spreads while many of our competitors had to cut back. In 2008 we provided $41 billion in new lending to businesses and individuals. Our average loans rose 16 percent. Our average commercial and commercial real estate loans rose 25 percent. Wells Fargo + Wachovia: growth opportunities Building on our strength and performance, this merger presents us with significant growth opportunities in each of our major business groups. Here's just a sample: Community Banking: beyond deposits In addition to our 24 Wells Fargo Community Banking states in the Midwest, the Southwest, the Rockies and the West, Wachovia introduces us to 15 more states: Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Our 2008 acquisition of Century Bancshares established our Community Banking presence in Arkansas. At year-end 2008, our combined company was #1 in deposit market share in 18 of our 39 Community Banking states and the District of Columbia. Ninety-three percent of our deposits were in states in which we rank #1, 2 or 3. We ranked #1 in 10 of the nation's 20 largest metro areas in deposit market share (excluding deposits $500+ million in a single banking store). There's more to financial services, however, than just deposits. There's significant potential for more growth in all these states because banking deposits are an important but relatively small portion of average household assets. In fact, our share of total household assets in any of these states is probably no more than 5 percent. We want to go beyond deposits and satisfy all the financial needs of Wachovia's retail banking and brokerage households -- not just deposits, loans and lines of credit, but their credit cards, debit cards, insurance, brokerage, 401(k)s, mortgage, home equity, and on and on. Take a quick inventory of all your own household's financial products. You'll probably come up with about 16, which you bought from several providers. We believe you can save more time and money if you have all your products with one trusted provider that can offer you, and deliver on, a compelling value proposition. The same goes for our business banking customers. We want to satisfy all their financial needs -- not just their deposits, loans and lines of credit but their private banking, mortgage, treasury management, payroll processing, merchant processing, insurance, and on and on. We're not satisfied with just being #1 in deposit market share. We want to be known as the best in every product in every market in which we do business, in retail banking, business banking, investments and mortgage -- and be the first provider our customers think of when they need their next financial product. Both our companies are learning from each other. Wachovia will help Wells Fargo make the customer experience in our banking stores even better. Wells Fargo will help further strengthen the Wachovia sales process. For example, only one of every

10 Wachovia banking customers has a Wachovia credit card; four of every 10 Wells Fargo customers have a Wells Fargo credit card. Wells Fargo's Deposit Leadership

The mortgage and banking opportunity: huge! With checking, investments and insurance, mortgage is one of our four core products -- one that our customers value so much that if they have it with us, then they're more likely to buy more products from us. This makes it an indispensable part of satisfying all their financial needs. We've had a significant retail mortgage presence in the Eastern U.S. for a long time; we now have a significant Community Banking presence there as well. This is one of the biggest cross-sell opportunities of the Wachovia merger -- the opportunity in 15 more states to earn all the banking business of our mortgage customers and all the mortgage business of Wachovia's banking households. This opportunity alone could generate millions of dollars of added revenue because we have about three million Wells Fargo Home Mortgage customers in the 15 states we enter with Community Banking through the Wachovia merger.

"Despite the pain of 2008, we continue to believe in the spirit, ingenuity, work ethic, creativity and adaptability of American workers. We're capitalists and proud of it. We believe in free enterprise. We're Americans first, bankers second. We're long-term optimists. We believe in the economic potential of every one of our communities."
How we lend responsibly Irrational lenders come and go -- mostly they go! We will stay -- as we have for 157 years through virtually every economic cycle -- by lending responsibly, making high-quality loans to good customers, helping them succeed financially. That's why we've avoided most of the recent problems of the mortgage industry. It's why 93 of every 100 of our mortgage customers were current with their payments at year-end 2008, performance consistently better than the industry average. We still make mortgage loans the old-fashioned way. We do not underwrite a mortgage loan unless we believe the borrower can repay it according to its terms. The loan must have a clear benefit for the customer such as reducing the interest rate or monthly payment on debt, obtaining significant new money, paying off delinquent real estate-secured debt, converting an adjustable rate to a fixed rate, or buying a home. We want to give customers all the information they need so they know what they're buying, what it will cost and that it's right for them. If our customers have trouble making payments, we try to contact them early and often so we can help them make their payments on time. Wells Fargo-Wachovia has 8,000 team members (double more than a year ago) working just to help these customers keep their homes. In 2008 we helped more than a half million of our mortgage customers with loan solutions. We were able to contact 94 of every 100 of our mortgage customers who were two payments late. We helped more than half of those 94 avoid foreclosure through refinancing, reducing payments, agreeing to new repayment plans, short sales (the proceeds are less than what the owner still owes on the mortgage), term extensions up to 40 years, reduced interest rates, no interest charge on part of the principal for some period of time and, in some markets, reduced principal -- and making sure these modified loans are right for investors. To help sustain neighborhoods, we're selling vacant and foreclosed properties at significant discounts to new owners, including first-time homebuyers, by working closely with real estate agents, housing nonprofits and city officials. We've made $33 million in grants to nonprofit housing organizations the last two years. The past several years Wachovia offered a Pick-a-Payment® mortgage loan that allowed customers to choose from among four payment options including a monthly payment that may not cover interest charges, perhaps causing the unpaid principal to increase. Wells Fargo did not offer so-called negative amortizing loans. We're managing the Pick-a-Payment portfolio as a separate business unit distinct from the rest of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. At the end of 2008, as part of the accounting for the merger, we charged off $22.2 billion on this portfolio. In January and February 2009 we gave an extension to Wachovia mortgage customers being referred to, or in, foreclosure to give them time to contact us so we could work with them to help them keep their homes. Wealth Management: just the beginning The Wells Fargo-Wachovia merger combines extraordinary talent and resources in wealth management. We now have 16,000 financial advisors managing $1 trillion in client assets through bank, private client and independent channels. That includes our coast-to-coast wealth management organization with $150 billion in client assets. We provide private banking, trust and family office services to affluent investors, from those just beginning to accumulate wealth to those who have many financial services needs. We're one of the nation's top-seven retirement record keepers for 3.6 million participants. We're also one of the nation's largest retirement administrators and a leading distributor of IRA and annuity products. Impressive, but it's just a start. We want all our wealth management, brokerage and retirement services customers to bank with Wells Fargo. We want all our banking customers to think of us first for all their wealth management needs. Our goal is to be the most respected provider of wealth, brokerage and retirement services in the United States, number one, second to none. Wholesale Banking: the full relationship The Wells Fargo-Wachovia merger creates what we believe is the most comprehensive offering of products and services for commercial and corporate customers in the United States. Nationwide, we're now the #1 lender to middle market companies ($25 million to $500 million in annual revenue), #1 commercial real estate lender, #1 commercial real estate broker and the #1 bank-owned insurance broker. Despite the economic downturn, many of our best corporate and commercial customers are receiving loans that are wellstructured with pricing appropriate for the risk. Lending is just one part of a full-service relationship. It's not uncommon for many of our commercial customers to have dozens of products

with us covering the full range of lending and operating services such as Treasury Management, the Commercial Electronic Office,® and Desktop Deposit.® Our Asset Management group now has $500 billion in assets under management. In the last five years our mutual funds have grown from the 27th-largest fund complex in 2003 ($78 billion) to the 14th-largest in 2008 ($172 billion). Combined with Wachovia's Evergreen Investments, our mutual fund assets under management had a balance of $250 billion, among the 15 largest in our industry. We welcome to our Board With the merger, four members of the Wachovia Board have joined the Wells Fargo Board, and we're benefiting from their experience and knowledge of Wachovia's markets and customers. We welcome: · John Baker, president and CEO of Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc., Jacksonville, Florida, Wachovia Board member since 2001. Don James, chairman and CEO of Vulcan Materials Company, Birmingham, Alabama, Wachovia Board member since 2004. Mackey McDonald, retired chairman and CEO of VF Corporation, an apparel manufacturer in Greensboro, North Carolina, Wachovia Board member since 1997. Bob Steel, former president and CEO of Wachovia Corporation, Wachovia Board member since 2008.

We also thank: · Dick Kovacevich, who, at the Board's invitation, agreed to continue as chairman for an interim period to help us successfully integrate Wachovia into Wells Fargo. His experience and counsel are needed now more than ever because he shaped our company's vision and values and led what is known as the most successful merger of two large financial services companies in U.S. history -- the Norwest-Wells Fargo merger 10 years ago. Phil Quigley, who our Board elected to the new position of lead director to work with Dick and me to approve Board meeting agendas, chair meetings of independent directors, call executive sessions of the Board, help ensure coordinated coverage of Board responsibilities, and facilitate communication between the Board and senior management. Mike Wright, retired chairman and CEO of SUPERVALU INC., who will retire from the Board in April 2009 after 18 years of service to our company. Mike joined our Board in 1991 and has served on the Credit, Human Resources, and Governance and Nominating Committees. We thank him for his outstanding contributions to the governance of our company.

higher unemployment, less disposable income and discretionary spending, more bankruptcies. Credit quality will not improve until the housing market stabilizes. Charge-offs (uncollectible debt) probably will continue to rise. Loan losses in consumer credit businesses including home equity will continue higher than normal until home values stop falling. Regardless of what the economy and the markets do in 2009, we focus on our vision and on doing what's right for our customers. Now, more than ever before in our lifetimes, people need a safe, trustworthy, capable financial advisor who can partner with them to help plan and achieve their financial goals for a home, education, building a business and retirement. Despite the pain of 2008, we continue to believe in the spirit, ingenuity, work ethic, creativity and adaptability of American workers. We're capitalists and proud of it. We believe in free enterprise. We're Americans first, bankers second. We're long-term optimists. We believe in the economic potential of every one of our communities, from Atlanta to Anchorage, from Galveston to Great Falls. We believe in the United States of America as a beacon for freedom, liberty and economic opportunity worldwide. We believe our country can learn from its mistakes and survive downturns in business cycles better than any country in the world. It's still the global leader in technology, manufacturing and services, still the global leader by far in gross domestic product, still the leader in global buying power, still the best place in the world in which to invest and do business. Our country and our ancestors have faced far more difficult challenges than those we face today. Just ask your grandparents or read about their lives. My parents were children of the Great Depression. They raised 11 children on a family farm in central Minnesota, worked hard and sacrificed, and taught us what is really important in life. I see no reason why with discipline and determination our great country cannot persevere and prosper through these times as well. Now more than ever before, our company wants to stand by our customers and do what's right for them just as Wells Fargo has done for almost 16 decades and seven generations. We thank all our 281,000 team members from Wells Fargo and Wachovia for working together with our customers to earn more of their business and for collaborating to help ensure a smooth merger integration. We thank our customers for entrusting us with more of their business and for returning to us for their next financial services product. We thank our communities for allowing us to serve them. And we thank you, our owners, for your confidence in Wells Fargo as we begin our 158th year. Together we'll go far!

The year ahead: we believe in America If you're a pessimist, there's a lot for you to like about 2009. It will be a rough year for our economy and our industry. Consumer loans will continue under stress with falling home prices, a nine-month inventory of unsold homes nationally,

John G. Stumpf, President and Chief Executive Officer
