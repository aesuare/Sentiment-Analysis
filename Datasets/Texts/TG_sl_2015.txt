DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,
reasons. Some of you have a market theme, others are relying on a particular analytical model or recommendation, and perhaps one or two of you threw a dart at a stock listing page. Regardless, I suspect all prefer that Tredegar communications be as direct and straightforward as possible. I cannot emphasize enough that transparency is a priority for me. A company's annual report is addressed to its owners, the shareholders. I identify with shareholders easily. A good portion of the shares I own predate Tredegar's creation as a spinoff from Ethyl Corporation in 1989, and a good number of those shares predate Ethyl's entry into the aluminum extrusion and plastic film industries in the 1960s. So I see things through the prism of a longterm owner. I recognize that investors make their equity selections for a variety of Before I address our performance and initiatives, I'd like to express a business version of Utopia using motherhood and apple pie like truisms. Management's role is to channel a diverse organization's talents to capture highly profitable growth opportunities. This is best done with a focus on satisfying or preferably delighting customers through cost-effective innovation, flawless service and continuous improvement. Once success takes hold, enthusiasm blossoms and a prosperous cycle should result. So, with that fundamental characterization of business harmony stated for the record, here's one shareholder's direct and straightforward report to other owners. First, I feel a need to acknowledge that I'm disappointed and have been for quite a while. An investment in Tredegar stock has not provided a worthwhile return on investment since the turn of the century (see chart below). I pride myself on patience, but I suspect 15 years would push Job to the limit. On the positive side, the company has increased its payout over recent years. From December of 2012 to date, the company has distributed $1.85 to shareholders in regular and special dividends. However, the stock price has continued to languish. I am not an expert on stock valuation, but I am confident that generating cash and growing earnings while

maintaining a solid balance sheet is a good formula. Unfortunately, since the recession of 2008­09 Tredegar's earnings per share from ongoing operations is only 17% higher, despite our investing about $500 million in acquisitions and internal projects (see chart above). All of you want to know how we plan to improve Tredegar's performance. Our company has many stories, and we are executing on specific strategic priorities for each of our business units to address their unique opportunities and challenges. Tredegar's aluminum extrusions unit, Bonnell, has performed well since the 2008­09 recession (see chart above). The acquisition of AACOA in 2012 has strengthened Bonnell. In 2015, Bonnell's return on capital employed reached 19.2%.* Looking forward, Tredegar's board recently approved a project to expand extrusion capacity at Bonnell's Niles plant. This new press will provide for growth in 2017. In addition, we will consider an acquisition while remaining mindful of the cyclicality of the markets in which

we participate. Keeping costs down and operations reliable are always critical in this business. Another positive story has been the growth of our Surface Protection films business unit. Our company, over many years, has developed very unique capabilities that help customers protect valuable component layers in a number of optical display devices (including TVs, computer and tablet screens, and smartphones). As we help our customers reduce flaws, their manufacturing efficiencies and costs improve. Participation in information technology markets brings both a demand for extraordinary quality and relentless cost pressures. Rapid innovation of our products is not a luxury. It is a necessity without which sales become fleeting. Over recent months Tredegar has committed to ramping up our product development activity throughout our businesses. This is a critical initiative as we endeavor to improve our organic growth. Unfortunately, the growth in Bonnell and Surface Protection films over the past two years has been overwhelmed by a negative sales trend in our

Personal Care business unit (see chart on next page). We have taken great care in recent public disclosures to outline the impact of customer decisions to reduce purchases from Tredegar. Given the record since 2013, it is clear that we have failed to channel our strengths to delight all of our customers. Reversing this trend will require changes in the way we interact with and develop solutions for our customers. We are investing in our people and technology with the goal of growing revenues. To this end, we've increased our R&D costs by $4 million annually for resources specifically supporting growth opportunities in acquisition distribution layer, elastics and topsheets in Personal Care and new opportunities in Surface Protection. Despite the record, there is good news here. We are blessed with talent. Our technology and global position are valued. We have recently made progress improving some critical customer relations. And we will launch new elastic and acquisition distribution layer products this year. Hopefully we will see the beginning of a more prosperous cycle soon.

In 2011, Tredegar acquired Terphane, which manufactures flexible packaging products primarily for the Latin American market. From 2012 through the middle of 2015, this business unit experienced a very significant decline in performance (see chart above). The magnitude of the decline and reduced outlook caused us to write off its goodwill on our balance sheet. Terphane has experienced a number of operational and quality issues during the last two to three years as one existing line was upgraded and a new line was put in place. There continue to be episodes of inconsistency but recently operations have become much more reliable. This helps a great deal as we look to 2016 and beyond. There are two big issues that remain. First, the bulk of Terphane's operations and half of our sales are in Brazil, which continues to be in a very tough recession. Second, there is large excess global capacity in the industry causing very significant pricing pressure. Despite these challenges, Terphane's excellent team has taken us from a troubling stretch

of losses to profitability over the past few months. We are hoping that the operational improvements and progress bringing new products to market will keep us on a positive slope despite the economic and market challenges. There is one additional business unit within Tredegar. It is an emerging story. Our Engineered Polymer Solutions unit primarily manufactures products that enhance the effectiveness of LED lighting. This is a rapidly growing market. I believe the key for success in this unit will be our ability to broaden our product lines and commercialize new products. Investments to achieve those objectives are in the works. We believe that Tredegar will be experiencing strong growth from this unit, but it will be a few years before it is a significant contributor. In summary, a key part of my job is to channel the efforts of our employees such that we can seize the opportunities, grow and prosper. As outlined above, we have stumbled and we have big challenges. As we build customer confidence and gain traction with

an increased focus on organic growth, I hope that shareholders will see progress on creating value...in the form of prosperity! Since last year's annual meeting, two of the members of Tredegar's Board of Directors have stepped down, Greg Williams and Nancy Taylor. I greatly appreciate the service of these two long-term contributors to Tredegar. They put tremendous efforts into this company for which I am very grateful.

John D. Gottwald President and Chief Executive Officer
