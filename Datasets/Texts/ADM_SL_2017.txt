     Dear Stockholders,
ADM works to grow earnings and returns by anticipating and meeting trends in demand for basic foods, ingredients, food solutions that promote health and wellness, and renewable fuels and chemicals.
Our three-part strategy for achieving those goals — enhancing our core; advancing Readiness, the evolution of our operational excellence efforts; and growing strategically, particularly in the areas of our value chain that are closer to the end customer — continues to drive the company’s long-term vision and our ability to deliver strong results for share- holders.
In 2017, ADM delivered adjusted earnings of $2.43 per share, compared with $2.16 in the prior year — a 12.5 percent increase. We also improved our trailing four-quarter average adjusted return on invested capital (ROIC) to 6.4 percent — 40 basis points above our annual weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 6.0 percent.
This performance enabled us to generate positive economic value added, or EVA, of almost $100 million on a four-quarter trailing average basis during the year. At the same time, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in 2017 as part of a bal- anced capital-allocation framework that also provides for investments in long-term value creation. Much of that amount came in the form of shareholder dividends. The fourth quarter of 2017 was our 345th consecutive quarterly payment, or 86 uninterrupted years of dividends.
Following are highlights of the year’s key strategic accomplishments:
• Enhancingourcore.Ourworktooptimizeourportfolioofexistingbusinessesresultedinsignificantvolumegrowth in our specialty oils business; operating profit growth of more than 25 percent in our WILD Flavors business; and year-over-year volume growth of more than 20 percent for our destination-marketing business.
We also continued to manage our asset portfolio to maximize returns, including the sale of our Crop Risk Services business and the agreement to sell our oilseeds crushing operations in Bolivia.
• ImprovingourcoststructurethroughReadiness.Readinessisamultiyearinitiativecombiningleanmanufactur- ing, process standardization and digital design. Its objectives are to lower costs and enable consistently great customer experiences. In 2017, we achieved $285 million in run-rate cost savings, and we will continue improving efficiency and reducing costs by leveraging technology to help save hundreds of millions of additional dollars.
• GrowingstrategicallybybuildingoutourintegratedvaluechaininEMEA.OuracquisitionsofChamtor—a French company that produces sweeteners from wheat — and Biopolis, the Valencia, Spain-based probiotics manu- facturer, have increased our participation in the regional markets for sweeteners, starches and bioactives. We grew our destination marketing business in the Middle East with the acquisition of a majority stake in Israel’s Industries Centers, and in early 2018, we announced the formation of a joint venture with Cargill to provide soybean meal and oil for customers in Egypt.
We also continued using the increased flex-crush capacity at our German oilseeds facilities to crush non-GMO soy- beans to meet the region’s growing demand. And in March of this year, we announced an agreement to acquire a
50 percent equity stake in the sweeteners and starches business of Russia-based Aston Foods and Food Ingredients, a move that will allow us to address the Russian food and beverage industry’s growing ingredient needs. We are also investing to move closer to customers to help them lead in fast-growing market segments, including natural flavors and colors, plant-based proteins, ancient grains and soluble fiber.

 2018 outlook
As we did last year, we are pulling the levers under our control in 2018 to drive results, even as “green shoots” of improv- ing business conditions continue to emerge in various segments. Our emphasis is on optimizing our existing businesses, and on reducing run-rate costs by an additional $200 million through Readiness. We will accelerate Readiness in 2018, with initiatives including:
• Thecontinuedrolloutof1ADM,ourbusinesstransformationprojectthatishelpingstandardizeprocessesandsys- tems, improve decision-making, and control costs.
• Drivingenergy-efficiencyprojectswithhigh-efficiencymotors,low-energyevaporationtechnologiesandlow-energy mixing technology.
• BroadeningourPerformanceExcellenceinitiative—arigorousprogramthatisempowering,engagingandenabling front-line colleagues to help improve and standardize processes throughout the business.
We also will benefit from several of our largest recent investments — including our Campo Grande, Brazil, specialty pro- teins complex — ramping up production in 2018.
Leading with a clear purpose
As a premier global agribusiness and food-ingredient provider, ADM plays a critical role in feeding a protein-hungry world whose population will surpass 9.5 billion by the middle of this century. At the same time, our mission has evolved to include providing better nutrition for consumers worldwide, which has a positive impact on people’s quality of life.
To fulfill these commitments to our customers, their consumers and society at-large, we will pursue growth in five key plat- forms that we believe hold great potential to drive stronger earnings and returns. They are:
• Taste:We’vealreadyseentremendousgrowthintheWILDFlavorsbusinessweacquiredin2014.Goingforward,we will advance our product-innovation work, broaden our foodservice and private-label customer base, and work to replicate our regional strengths — such as the culinary capabilities we’ve built in North America following our 2015 acquisition of Eatem Foods — on a global scale. We also plan to continue expanding our network of innovation cen- ters, which enable us to collaborate with customers on new-product development and reformulations. We opened one facility in Sydney in 2017 and another in Singapore in January 2018, following on the Cranbury, New Jersey, center we opened in 2016.
• Nutrition:InadditiontoacceleratingsalesfromtheCampoGrandespecialtyproteinscomplex,weseeopportunities to leverage our existing strengths in proteins, fibers, edible beans and other food ingredients to develop new products and services that help our customers respond effectively to changing consumer preferences.
• AnimalNutrition:Asglobalmeatconsumptioncontinuestoincrease,wewillserveasaleadingproviderofhigh- quality animal nutrition products for livestock and aquaculture producers, as well as for companion-animal owners. With that goal in mind, last year we acquired the pet-treat manufacturer Crosswind Industries, Inc., completed our latest feed-premix facility in Zhangzhou, China, and announced plans to construct another premix plant in Xiangtan, China. We also added aquaculture feed production lines at our existing Nanjing, China, complex.
• Bioactives:Science’sunderstandingofthehumanandanimalgutmicrobiomescontinuestodeepen,whichprovides ADM with an opportunity to build a portfolio of prebiotics and probiotics, personalized nutrition solutions and animal-health enzymes that address fast-growing demand across the food and beverage, personal care, infant care and pharmaceutical segments. Last year’s acquisition of Biopolis gave us a strong presence in this sector, and our subsequent announcement of a joint research partnership with the Mayo Clinic centered on weight loss could result in findings with broad implications for human health and wellness. Meanwhile, in January 2018, we announced a joint development agreement with Qingdao Vland Biotech Group Co., Ltd., for the development and commercialization of enzymes for animal feed applications. And later this year, we will open a new enzyme lab in Davis, California, to sup- port additional research and commercialization efforts.
• Carbohydrates:Withaviewtogrowingourindustrial,foodandspecialty-starchportfolios,wewillcreateabroader carbohydrate platform with significant growth potential. Our acquisition of Chamtor, our launch of new sweeteners made from stevia and monk fruit, and the continued success of the former Eaststarch sweetener operations in Eastern Europe illustrate just some of the possibilities.

 Safety, Sustainability and Service to Our Communities
The health and safety of our 31,000 colleagues around the globe will always be our highest priority. The fourth quarter of 2017 was ADM’s single safest three-month period on record, and we set three monthly safety records during the calendar year.
Also ongoing is our work to strengthen our environmental performance and the integrity of our supply chain. In May, we reported that ADM had reduced energy intensity by 25 percent and emissions by 11 percent on a per-unit-of-production basis since 2010; water usage declined nearly 25 percent on the same basis since 2008. In keeping with the commitments set forth in the no-deforestation policy we adopted in 2015, we reported achieving 98 percent traceability in our palm oil supply chain; 95.5 percent traceability for palm kernel oil; and 99 percent traceability to the municipality/district level for our soybean supply chain.
Because we believe that a key success factor for businesses is an inclusive culture and a diverse workforce, ADM founded and currently leads Together We Grow, a cross-functional council representing industry, academia, NGOs and legislative bodies that are working to grow the pipeline of diverse talent within the agricultural industry. We also are a member of CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, a CEO-led collaboration to cultivate workplaces that are both diverse and inclusive. Companywide, we continue to invest in colleague development to further enhance our team’s capabilities and build our base of talent for the future.
As we move further into 2018, I am proud of our 31,000 colleagues’ dedication and sense of responsibility for delivering the best performance possible. Their perseverance, customer focus and commitment to excellence in all they do was evident throughout 2017, and I am confident we will have many more positive developments to write about next year at this time.
Sincerely,
Juan R. Luciano
Chairman, CEO and President
