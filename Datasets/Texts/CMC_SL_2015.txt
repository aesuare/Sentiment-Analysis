TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS
WE END OUR FIRST CENTURY WITH ANOTHER YEAR OF PROFITABILITY. 2015 marks Commercial Metals Company's 100th year of operations. Fiscal 2015 is also CMC's fourth consecutive year of profitability, as we continue to rebuild our company in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in 2008, the repercussions of which continue to challenge our entire industry. We realized earnings from continuing operations for fiscal 2015 of $161.3 million, on net sales of $6.0 billion compared to $109.1 million on net sales of $6.8 billion in fiscal 2014. Our continued profitability in the face of economic global challenges validates the strategies of CMC management ­ including focusing on core businesses and rigorously cutting costs ­ and attests to the commitment of our 9,000-person strong workforce. That said, each of CMC's business segments is also impacted by a different combination of market factors. Facing significant market challenges leading to decreases in both average ferrous and nonferrous metal margins, our Americas Recycling segment did not achieve profitability in fiscal 2015. Adjusted operating loss for fiscal 2015 was $18.6 million, compared to an adjusted operating loss of $3.2 million in fiscal 2014. Our Americas Mills segment benefited from factors, including a lower average cost of ferrous scrap consumed, contributing to an increased average metal margin. In fiscal 2015, this segment realized adjusted operating profit of $304.3 million, compared to $247.7 million in fiscal 2014, despite having to battle a dramatic year over year increase in imported product. Increases in average composite selling prices together with lower input costs helped our Americas Fabrication segment realize its highest level of profitability since fiscal 2009. Adjusted operating profit for fiscal 2015 was $39.2 million, compared to $6.2 million in fiscal 2014. In the face of sluggish Central European demand and pressure from imports in fiscal 2015, our International Mill segment recorded an adjusted operating profit of $17.6 million, compared to $30.6 million in fiscal 2014. Despite the challenge of a strong U.S. dollar in fiscal 2015, our International Marketing and Distribution segment realized adjusted operating profit of $57.9 million, compared to $24.0 million in fiscal 2014.

MAINTAINING A STRONG FINANCIAL POSITION CMC continues to enjoy the advantage of a strong balance sheet, with approximately $1.2 billion in liquidity. Our focus on controlling costs will be maintained. In fiscal 2015, our adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations reached $464.6 million, the highest figure since fiscal 2008. INVESTING IN OUR COMPANY Reflecting confidence in the future, in fiscal 2015, we implemented a new share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $100 million of outstanding common stock of CMC. Under this program, we repurchased 2,902,218 shares of common stock for $41.8 million in fiscal 2015. Another manifestation of our confidence in CMC's continued long-term success is our ongoing capital expenditure program. In fiscal 2015, we devoted $115.8 million to capital expenditures across all segments of the enterprise. GROWING OUR CORE BUSINESS One significant capital investment is in the new micro mill we have committed to building in Durant, Oklahoma. The addition of this technologically advanced micro mill to our portfolio of highly efficient, customer-focused, and cost-effective steel production facilities will enhance our position as a leading supplier of long products in the U.S. market. POSITIVE SIGNS We are encouraged by positive economic signs, including forecasted increases in U.S. non-residential construction spending and the expansion of U.S. manufacturing activity. Going forward, we are positioned to take advantage of improved economic conditions. OUR COMMITMENT With hard-working people, thoughtful investment, and skillful management, we are committed to strengthening our future in fiscal 2016 and in the years ahead. We are delivering industry-leading customer service, providing an environment where our employees can succeed, improving our communities, and creating value for our investors.
