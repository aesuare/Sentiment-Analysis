Performance
In this prospect-rich environment, we look to our relationship-based business model to help determine which opportunities to pursue. We have grown dramatically over the past couple of decades by focusing on core clients and long-term relationships—and our loyalty to them continues going forward. Eighty percent of our business today comes from clients who appreciate the value we deliver because, like us, they are growing their businesses.
We must continue to deliver superior value if we want to continue to be a supplier of choice for an increasing number of core clients. To this end, we challenge our people to continually improve and innovate in all aspects of project
We commit to our shareholders an average growth of 15% annually

To Our Shareholders
2005 was our best year ever. We increased our earnings by 17 percent over last year to a record $151 million; our earnings per share by 14 percent to $2.57 per share; and our revenues by 23 percent to $5.6 billion, all new records. Our balance sheet remains strong, with our only debt associated with merger activity and year-end working capital at $552.3 million.
Texas City Incident
Our strong financial performance was marred by a refinery explosion on March 23 in Texas City. Eleven of our people died while working in an area adjacent to a unit where the explosion occurred. The blast also killed four others and injured hundreds more. This terrible tragedy—our worst nightmare—shook the whole industry and caused tremendous personal pain and suffering. The entire Jacobs family responded with support and contributions. This catastrophe strengthens our resolve to ensure that things like this never happen again.
Strategic Growth
2005 was another year of significant growth as we focused on integrating our Babtie acquisition in the United Kingdom and continued to diversify and grow in our major markets. The magnitude of several Government and Oil & Gas wins elevates our stature in those markets and promises to drive our business in the coming years. Our success in 2005 reinforces our longstanding commitment to grow the business by 15 percent per year at the bottom line.
Currently, some of the strongest markets we have seen in decades are fueling our growth. Strong economies in North America, Asia, and Western Europe, along with the

                                          execution—and they deliver. In 2005 we raised our client satisfaction survey scores to 88 percent, up 8 points since 2000. More importantly, however, we delivered almost $600 million of documented savings to our clients on their projects. These savings can be significant, so much so that on some projects the savings we create for the client exceeds the cost of the professional services we provide. Putting our clients’ interest first is always our methodology for “delighting” them; look for it to stay that way.
People
The kind of growth we see and the value clients expect present many challenges, particularly with regard to the professional/technical talent that drives our industry. Looking forward, the volume of business coming our way means that talented people will be in short supply, particularly in North America and Europe. To prosper in this environment, we must retain and grow the talented people we have and reach out for new people across a wide range of geographies. We also need to continually train our people, as we’re doing in record numbers in our Jacobs College courses and throughout our operations.
One of our great strengths is our multidomestic geographic strategy. We operate in the local marketplace in countries across the globe at the same time we leverage this network to serve our global clients. This gives us tremendous access to people resources throughout our geographies, allowing us to support offices that have more work than they can handle by moving the work electronically to places with available talent. Our multidomestic approach also positions us to serve our clients locally while providing access to our global network for scarce technical skills that may reside at different locations. We’ve been working like this for years and the knowledge we’ve gained from this endeavor, along with
our ability to recruit people across the globe, allows us to prosper in an environment where others without our breadth and depth cannot.
We continue to look for new and better ways to deliver value to our clients and growth to our shareholders. We want to thank all of our clients, shareholders, and employees for your enthusiastic and loyal support. We look forward to sharing an exciting future as we grow together.
