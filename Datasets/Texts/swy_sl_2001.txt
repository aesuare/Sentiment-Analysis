  To Our Stockholders
We had another good year in 2001, achieving strong earnings growth while increasing capital expenditures to fuel future growth. We accomplished these results despite a slowing economy.
OPERATING RESULTS
Net income increased 14.8% to $1.3 billion ($2.44 per share) in 2001 from $1.1 billion ($2.13 per share) the year before. Results for 2001 reflect three after-tax charges unrelated to operations: $30.5 million ($0.06 per share) to cover an estimated loss arising from our 15% equity position in Future Beef Operations Holdings, LLC, a meat processing company that recently was placed in Chapter 11 bankruptcy; $25.5 million ($0.05 per share) for estimated lease liabilities associated with two former operating divisions that we sold in 1987 and that recently went bankrupt under new ownership; and $18.0 million ($0.04 per share) for impairment related to our invest- ment in an Internet grocery company, GroceryWorks Holdings, Inc. A prolonged strike against Summit Logistics, a company that operates our northern California distribution center, reduced 2000 net income by an estimated $66.6 million ($0.13 per share).
Total sales in 2001 rose 7% to $34.3 billion, primarily due to our acquisition of Genuardi’s, new store openings and increased sales at continuing stores. Adjusting for the strike in 2000, comparable-store sales for 2001 increased 1.8%, while identical-store sales (which exclude replace- ment stores) were up 1.1%.
Gross profit increased 123 basis points to 30.92% of sales. In addition to the Summit strike, which depressed gross margins in 2000, the improvement in 2001 was due primarily to better buying practices, continued reduction in “shrink” (product loss) and stronger pri- vate-label sales.
Operating and administrative expense, including good- will amortization, rose 81 basis points to 23.37% of sales in 2001. This increase follows eight consecutive years of declines, after adjusting for acquisitions. Most of the 2001 increase resulted from unfavorable comparisons in pension income and property gains; higher real estate occupancy costs; the acquisition of Genuardi’s, which had a higher expense ratio than we had; the reserve for estimated lease liabilities, as noted above; utility rate increases; and higher workers’ compensation costs.
Our interest coverage ratio (EBITDA divided by inter- est expense) improved to 8.02 times despite the additional debt incurred to finance the Genuardi’s acquisition and additional share repurchases.
SHARE REPURCHASES
During the year we repurchased 18.9 million shares of Safeway common stock for $781.3 million. As of year-end 2001, we had bought back $1.4 billion worth of our shares, leaving $1.1 billion available for additional repur- chases under the $2.5 billion program authorized by the board of directors. Future repurchases will depend on market conditions.

 “Almost 75% of Our Stores Have Been Built or Remodeled in the Past Five Years.”
STORE MODERNIZATION
Capital spending increased to $2.0 billion in 2001. During the year we opened 95 new stores, including 11 former ABCO units in Arizona. We also expanded or remodeled 255 existing stores and closed 49 older ones. Total retail square footage increased 4.6%, excluding the Genuardi’s acquisition. In 2002 we plan to spend more than $2.1 billion and open 80 to 85 new stores while completing approximately 250 remodels.
Almost 75% of our stores have been built or remod- eled in the past five years, up from approximately 50% at the beginning of 1997. During that time we have invested almost $7.3 billion (exclusive of acquisitions) to keep our store system, support facilities and technology up to date.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
In 2001 we made cash and in-kind donations of more than $100 million to non-profit organizations throughout the communities we serve. The primary recipients of our donations are food banks, schools, health and human ser- vice programs, and local charitable, civic and cultural orga- nizations. During 2001 we also raised more than $4 million for victims of the September 11th tragedies. In addition, we established The Safeway Foundation to facil- itate our giving programs in the future.
Many of our employees give generously of their time and talents to community organizations and causes. We encourage their efforts and periodically augment them with financial contributions from the company.
OUTLOOK
With consumer confidence gradually rebounding, we believe the outlook for economic recovery is more promis- ing than it had been at year-end 2001. Many indicators point to modest growth for the remainder of 2002, fol- lowed by a gradual acceleration of business investment and consumer spending next year.
Regardless of how long the slowdown may last, we’re con- vinced we have an unparalleled ability to reduce costs that enables us to weather the current storm. When the recovery shifts into a higher gear, we believe our lower cost structure will keep us “ahead of the curve,” and in a better position to benefit from resurgent consumer sentiment and spending.
Longer term, we are encouraged by the high productiv- ity of our capital spending program and by the bright promise of several initiatives we have been developing to reduce costs further and drive sales. As we implement these initiatives and the business climate gradually improves, we expect to enjoy continued success in 2002 and beyond.
In closing, I’d like to thank all 193,000 members of the Safeway team for their tireless efforts in executing our growth strategy. Our employees are the primary source of our past achievements and the key to our future success.
