FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
Fiscal 2012, despite multiple challenges, was one of significant achievement by the people of Western Digital.
We dealt with the after effects on our operations and supply chain of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the ruinous flooding in Thailand through the passion, dedication and remarkable recovery work of our employees and supply partners, and to the support of our many loyal customers.
We also completed the largest transaction of its kind in our industry when we completed the $4.7 billion acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, now our HGST subsidiary. Consistent
with regulatory requirements, we are operating WD and HGST as separate subsidiaries for at least two years.
Revenues grew by nearly one-third and earnings more than doubled from the prior year, extending Western Digital’s 10-year record of compound annual revenue and earnings per share growth to 19% and 34%, respectively. Driving this track record is our constant focus on identifying and successfully addressing evolving market trends and delighting customers with innovative, high-quality and reliable products to address those trends.
We continued to produce robust cash flows in fiscal 2012 that further strengthened our financial condition. We invested
$1.1 billion in research and development and $717 million in capital improvements to generate a continued flow of innovations and the facilities and equipment needed to produce them, as well as to fund our recovery of capacity impaired by the flooding.

Hard drive industry shipments slipped to 599 million units
from the year-earlier 657 million, reflecting flood-related supply constraints, continued sluggish consumer spending and market shifts to devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Our approximately 45% share in this market exiting fiscal 2012 indicates continued customer preference and satisfaction with our WD and HGST subsidiaries as reliable providers of high-quality storage

  It is already clear that customers understand and appreciate the respective strengths of our WD and HGST subsidiaries. In the months since HGST joined Western Digital, we have been able to confirm the robustness and predictability of HGST’s business operations, processes and controls. Nevertheless, we see many opportunities for further improvement in the respective cost structures of both our HGST and WD subsidiaries as newer areal density platforms come into production and as the recovery from flood related matters concludes.

The industry’s mobile markets continue to demand that our products be made smaller, thinner, lighter and quieter, with ever- greater performance, reliability and environmental acceptability
— all at steadily reduced cost per unit of stored data. At the same time, the growth in data creation and usage is driving increasing demand for both high-capacity and high-performance drives in the personal, private and public cloud infrastructure, which feeds these mobile devices. These are challenges that fit the demonstrated capabilities of WD and HGST, both with decades-long experience and reputations as reliable, preferred suppliers of storage solutions.

    traditional enterprise and solid-state drive segments, brought about by the addition of HGST operations, are examples of this initiative.
Today, having shaken off the effects of crippling natural disasters, our operations are back on stride and delivering outstanding financial results. Those results show the value of the sustained agility of our operations.
Our vision is to empower people to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. In a world where digital content has become pervasive, persistent storage of meaningful personal information and memories is increasingly cherished. As the sheer volume of stored information and entertainment grows, ease of use in access and management is vital to the user experience and an area of significant opportunity. Western Digital today has a uniquely powerful combination of talent, experience and passion to continue to pioneer solutions in this growing and rewarding space.
It would be difficult to thank everyone responsible for our company’s performance in fiscal 2012. But, heading the list must be our long-time WD and HGST customers, who provided their understanding and support; our trusted supply partners, who provided nimble responsiveness; and our Western
Digital employees, who gave their commitment and energy in extraordinary measure. My thanks to all of you.
After thirty years at Western Digital I have made the decision to retire on January 2, 2013, the sixth anniversary of my appointment as CEO. Our President, Steve Milligan, will succeed me and also join the board at the time of my retirement. I am delighted to welcome Steve to the CEO position and know that, with his prior experience at Western Digital and with the great turnaround he led at HGST, he will provide the leadership required to take Western Digital onward to the next phase of our successful journey. Steve and I will be working together with the executive team over the next few months to ensure an orderly and effective leadership transition.
