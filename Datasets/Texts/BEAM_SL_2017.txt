 CHAIRMAN’S REPORT
   I am pleased to provide the following Chairman’s Report on the World Reach Group of companies for the year ended 30 June 2017.
Summary
Assessed in isolation, FY2017 clearly delivered a financial performance that was weaker than both anticipated or desired, with the Group sustaining its only loss in the last four financial years.
Although sales volumes and order frequencies were lower than anticipated, this has been fairly representative across our industry generally. I am however, both pleased and proud to say that our investment in future product opportunities has been sustained, and even expanded during this period.
We have also invested considerably in our online presence and capabilities, with the rebuilt and relaunched website of World Reach Limited subsidiary Beam Communications Pty Ltd (Beam) (www.beamcommunications. com.au) receiving two distinguished industry accolades during the year, as well as effusive praise and increased traffic from users. Following the success of the new Beam website, we are currently undertaking a
major revamp of the SatPhone Shop website to further increase custom and expand our overall product offering. That SatPhone Shop surpassed $1,000,000 in annual revenues
for the first time was significant, and directly related to the commitment we have shown to funding and building that business over the last five years.
The fruits of our other recent and ongoing investments are expected to be enjoyed in coming years, such that we are confident that our net result for FY2017 will in due course be shown to have been an aberration.
Financial Performance and Factors
While the Group’s short–term trading outlook will always be a key consideration of the Board and senior management, we are now well placed and well-funded to navigate periods of revenue and profit volatility.
The witnessing of lower order volumes and frequencies in the first half of the year led directly to the exercise of significant cost management and scrutiny. The Group’s net performance in the second half of FY2017 improved considerably, as more key products were delivered to key clients.
“The fruits of our other recent and ongoing investments are expected to be enjoyed in coming years, such that we are confident that our net result for FY2017 will in d”ue course be shown to have been an aberration.
The lowering of the Australian corporate tax It is a credit to our management and
 rate to 27.5% necessitated a balance sheet adjustment to the future value of those
tax losses already reflected in the Group’s accounts. We look forward to utilising that
tax asset in coming years. Indeed, the Board expects the Group to return to profit for FY2018 and FY2019, as new product developments are released to market.
The Group continues to benefit from the Australian Government R&D rebate, which subsidises our costly investments in new product development. We received $601,000 in July 2017, related to expenditure in FY2016, and the Group will soon lodge a submission related to its FY2017 expenditure, which will be of a greater magnitude than last year’s claim.
Capital and Funds Management
During FY2017, we were pleased to receive the support of SGV1 Holdings Limited (SGV), being an entity associated with Group director Mr Carl Hung, which has agreed to provide World Reach Limited with a secured loan finance facility of up to US$2M. As yet undrawn, that facility will greatly aid our ability to progress our existing product aspirations and in particular will be used to develop an innovative new terminal in conjunction with Inmarsat plc.
On 28 August 2017, we were delighted to announce that Australian telecommunications icon David Stewart had agreed to invest $1,940,000, by way of a placement of ordinary shares priced at a level 60% above World Reach’s then on-market bid price. After agreeing to the placement, David indicated that he would take up the conferred right to join the Board. These moves will reinforce the Group’s financial capacity as well as its collective managerial experience and acumen.
Product Developments
Two major product development projects
from Beam are scheduled for widespread release within the next 12 months, with considerable expected revenue impacts,
in FY2018 and FY2019. These products, which will not replace but rather augment our existing offerings, will enable greater flexibility, capability and choice for consumers and
we are consequently not only expecting, but for one of the projects, we are contractually assured of receiving a minimum of US$3M in revenues.
engineering staff that new products, such as the dual mode hotspot unit, to be known as the Thuraya WE, will soon commence deliveries. I encourage all shareholders to visit http://www. worldreach.com.au/we_video/, both to observe this unit’s impressive capabilities and utility, but also to appreciate the technical expertise required to design and produce it.
As announced in October 2016, and with the assistance of committed support from SGV as mentioned earlier, Beam was also granted approval from Inmarsat plc to develop and manufacture a new, innovative satellite data terminal, which when completed will provide Beam with a completely new platform for the development of various Inmarsat data solutions.
Beam’s reputation for timely, innovative and quality communications developments continues to be enhanced and the Board remains unapologetically committed
to funding, leveraging and adding to its engineering and project management expertise.
Appreciation to Staff and Board
In closing, I would like to thank the previous Chairman, Mr David Dawson, for tightly overseeing the Group’s activities during his Chairmanship period of two years, making my transition in December 2016 seamless.
I would also like to express my appreciation
to fellow directors Carl Hung and Michael Capocchi, as well as Michael’s executive team, for their on-going efforts to drive our Group to deliver the best possible returns for those we all ultimately serve: our shareholders.
