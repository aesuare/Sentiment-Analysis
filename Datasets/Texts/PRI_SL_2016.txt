To create financially independent families. Our
competitive advantages position us to continue delivering value to our stockholders.

MAKING A DIFFERENCE F O R M I D D L E I N C O M E FA M I L I E S

SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN 1977, PRIMERICA HAS FOCUSED ON SERVING MAIN STREET FAMILIES IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS NORTH AMERICA.
Middle income households are often underserved by financial services companies, resulting in a tremendous unmet need. Our unique business model and financial solutions allow us to satisfy this demand. Our representatives take an educational approach to helping their families, friends, and acquaintances understand essential financial concepts and select the appropriate solutions for their needs. Our business is frequently conducted at our client's home ­ often at the kitchen table ­ rather than in an office. We know our clients on a personal level, and the financial tools we deploy give us unparalleled insight into the financial goals of these families. Every day, Primerica makes a difference in the lives of middle income families. Our experience has shown that term life insurance is the best insurance option for our market, and Primerica now protects approximately 5 million people in North America. In 2016, we paid a record $1.2 billion in life insurance claims to beneficiaries when they needed assistance

the most. During the year, issued term life policies grew 15% over 2015, and newly issued face amount reached almost $90 billion. Our Term Life Insurance segment revenues increased 13% and operating income before income taxes grew 23% year-over-year. In 2016, our Investment and Savings Products (ISP) business positively impacted middle income families by providing solid investment fundamentals through an educational approach to investing. During the year, we helped thousands of new clients with their investment needs, and we had more than 2 million client investment accounts at year-end. In 2016, our ISP segment posted solid results despite strong prioryear comparables and market volatility early in the year. Total ISP product sales topped $5.5 billion and ISP net flows were $975 million for the year. We ended the year with a record $52 billion in client assets under management. In addition, during 2016 we were an active participant in the rulemaking process for the U.S. Department of Labor's Fiduciary Rule. Our priority continues to be doing what's best for our
Primerica representatives like Senior National Sales Director Jeff Fieldstad of Henderson, NV meet with clients in their homes to educate them and provide them the products and services they need for a better financial future.

MAKING A DIFFERENCE FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS

IN ADDITION TO MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF MAIN STREET FAMILIES, WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO PRODUCING SOLID FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN OUR TWO COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES AND INCREASING STOCKHOLDER VALUE BY ACTIVELY DEPLOYING CAPITAL.
During the year, operating revenues from our Term Life and ISP segments accounted for 57% and 35% of total operating revenues, respectively. Our Term Life business generates predictable long-term recurring income that protects us against significant fluctuations in the economy and market. Our distribution of products in our ISP segment generates significant recurring income with low underlying capital requirements, producing a high rate of return. Our strong and diversified cash flows have allowed us to return a significant amount of our operating earnings to stockholders. During 2016, we continued optimizing capital by repurchasing $150 million of our shares, which enabled the retirement of approximately 6% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2015. We also increased our annual dividend payout to $33 million during the year. These combined efforts reflect our confidence in our

business and future prospects. We're pleased to have returned approximately 85% of operating earnings to stockholders in 2016, including stockholder dividends. We also achieved a 22% increase in operating earnings per share (EPS) and operating return on adjusted equity (ROAE) expanded to 19.0% in 2016 versus 16.9% in the prior year. Primerica delivered a total stockholder return of 48%, including dividends, significantly outpacing the total return of the S&P 500 in 2016. Primerica has a strong balance sheet and conservative portfolio composed of high quality invested assets. Our reliance on investment returns is relatively low compared with the industry with a ratio of invested assets and cash to stockholders' equity at 2.1x and net investment income representing only 5% of our operating revenues in 2016. Primerica Life Insurance Company remains well positioned for future growth with a risk-based capital (RBC) ratio in excess of 450% at year end. Our financial strength was confirmed in 2016 when Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and A.M. Best Company affirmed their strong ratings of Primerica, Inc. and Primerica Life Insurance Company.

OUR DIFFERENCE IS OUR PEOPLE

OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE THE RESULT OF THE TREMENDOUS EFFORTS OF OUR SALES FORCE AND HOME OFFICE TEAMMATES.
Our people are our key competitive advantage. To continue growing our sales force year after year, we strive to improve every facet of life insurance licensing, including state and provincial processes, representative education, and test preparation. Our objective is to increase licensing success for the broader spectrum of recruits who are coming into our business. In 2016, we grew the size of our life-licensed sales force to 116,827, a 9% increase year-over-year. It is exciting to see that after 40 years in business, Primerica continues to attract a large number of aspiring entrepreneurs who are seeking a unique opportunity to build their own financial services businesses. In addition to the benefit of a larger sales force, our focus on the needs of the middle market led to increased productivity, which has remained at the top of our historical range for seven quarters through year-end 2016. As a result of both a larger sales force and high productivity, our 15% growth in life insurance policies issued in 2016 far exceeded the 1% increase

in application activity for individually underwritten life insurance policies reported by MIB Life Index in 2016. The size of our sales force alone is not the sole differentiator between Primerica and our competition: the leadership strength and experience of our sales force and home office team truly set us apart. The entrepreneurial men and women who lead our field force provide vision, training, and motivation. Our corporate senior leadership team ­ which averages over 30 years with the company ­ is committed to supporting the sales force and providing strategic vision and leadership for the company. Most importantly, our sales force leaders and the home office team are in lockstep in terms of understanding the company's mission, goals, and challenges, and we work together to meet the needs of our clients and to drive business growth.

In 2016, we grew the size of our life-licensed sales force to 116,827, a 9% increase year-over-year.

CONTINUING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE

At our core, Primerica is a leadership company, and we will continue to lead with great people, great products, and the use of cutting-edge technology. We excel at providing financial education and products to Main Street families, and our commitment to that market is unwavering. Thanks to the combined efforts of our exceptional field leadership, our 116,827 life insurance-licensed representatives, and the more than 2,000 people on our home office team, we are well positioned to continue building long-term value for all of our stakeholders in 2017 and for years to come. Thank you for your continued investment in Primerica.

Sincerely,

Glenn J. Williams Chief Executive Officer
