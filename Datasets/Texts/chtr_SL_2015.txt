Charter Spectrum, our advanced and high-value product suite, has made Charter the fastest growing cable company in the United States today.

Our core strategy, to deliver superior products at highly competitive prices, combined with outstanding service, continues to drive Charter's strong operating and financial momentum. And that momentum continues to improve, as Charter Spectrum®, our advanced and high-value product suite, has made Charter the fastest growing cable company in the United States today. Looking forward, we intend to apply the same customer-focused strategy that has worked so well at Charter, to drive growth across the broader footprint we will manage, following the close of our transactions with Time Warner Cable Inc. and Bright House Networks, LLC. The success of our consumer-focused strategy and the increasing value we provide to our customers is reflected in our 2015 performance metrics. We finished 2015 with 6.7 million residential and SMB (small and medium-sized business) customers, increasing our customer base by 6%. We grew revenue by 7.1% and our Adjusted EBITDA, excluding transactions transition costs, grew by 8.5%. Our Adjusted EBITDA growth continues to exceed our revenue performance, highlighting the cost benefits of providing high-quality service. That EBITDA growth, combined with declining capital intensity, is driving greater free cash flow. Charter generated approximately $550 million of free cash flow in 2015, more than double the amount of free cash flow we generated in 2014.

In video, our total customer base grew by 11,000 relationships in 2015, compared to a loss of 78,000 last year. This is the first time in more than a decade that Charter has added video customers during any 12-month period. Driving that growth is an improved video offering, with more HD than satellite, VOD and interactive guide functionality on every device, backed by high-quality US-based customer service. We also continued to grow our Internet business in 2015, growing our residential Internet customer base by nearly 450,000 or 9%. Our low-cost, high-speed Internet offering provides great value to consumers, whether purchased inside one of our bundles or on a standalone basis. At year end, nearly 90% of our residential Internet customers subscribed to Internet service that provided speeds of 60 Mbps or more. We continue to be an industry leader in Internet customer growth by offering high speeds at low price points, with no data caps, no usage-based billing, and no modem rental fees. And in commercial, we also continued to drive accelerating customer growth. We separated our SMB and enterprise segments early last year, and launched new pricing and packaging to both marketplaces. We are seeing the results we expected with SMB primary service unit growth accelerating by 30% in 2015. We enter 2016 with three key priorities: executing on our core customer growth strategy, making the Spectrum product set even better, and closing and integrating the pending Time Warner Cable and Bright House transactions. We remain focused on growing our business by increasing longlasting customer relationships. We grow loyal customer relationships by going to market with a simple, high-quality product set-- Charter Spectrum--which we offer at very affordable prices. We hire, train and manage our employees, creating a skilled labor force that provides a better service experience to our customers. Today, nearly 90% of our customer calls are handled onshore and in-house, and 95% of our service truck rolls are in-house. We are taking steps to make our Spectrum products even better, and will be rolling out our new cloud-based Spectrum Guide in 2016. The Guide's more intuitive and feature-rich user interface improves both video search and discovery, fully enables our On Demand offering, and allows us to include Internet video in the guide which enhances the value of our service. It turns every TV into a connected Smart TV, and it allows us to integrate third-party video services, including over-the-top providers, such as YouTube ®, Netflix®, and Hulu ® --giving consumers the ability

to search and view all the content they are interested in, without changing consumer-owned hardware or devices. Our initial Spectrum Guide launches are working and scaling well, and customers are responding positively. Over the course of 2016, we will also expand our On Demand library with thousands of additional titles, and we will continue to improve our capabilities on additional devices with more live, On Demand and download to go content. And, in Internet, we are beginning rollouts of Spectrum WiFi, which provides unlimited Internet access to our residential customers when they are outside the home through hotspots. Finally, we have made good progress on our transactions with Time Warner Cable and Bright House, which will bring significant benefits to all of our stakeholders. For consumers, these transactions will mean better products at better prices, with high-quality service. For our employees and vendors, our new company will offer greater opportunities, as we grow our business, develop new products and compete in new lines of business. And for shareholders, our transactions will create a new entity with greater scale, an enhanced footprint, new revenue and product innovation opportunities, and significant cost savings and tax benefits--all of which will lead to faster customer growth, greater financial growth, and significant long-term value. Our transactions financing and integration plans are in place and we are prepared to bring Charter's value-rich product offering and customer-focused approach to the new footprint. We look forward to closing shortly, so that we can provide these benefits to the communities we will serve. I would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and hard work in bringing our highly-competitive consumer-friendly products to market, and in preparing Charter for the integration of our expanded footprint. To our investors--we appreciate your continued support. We are well-positioned to drive greater growth for our company and create additional value for our shareholders. Best Regards,
