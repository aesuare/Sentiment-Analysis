To Our Shareholders
Just as we expected, SunTrust’s performance picture brightened during 2003 as various performance-oriented investments and programs we put in place in recent years paid off with an increasingly positive impact.
By the end of 2003, against the backdrop of an improving economy, earnings trends were strong – and considerably more promising than they were when the year began.
For the full year, net income was a solid $1.3 billion, or $4.73 per fully diluted share, a modest improvement over the prior year. Return on average assets was 1.09% and return on common equity was 14.67%.
From an investment perspective, SunTrust share price improved some 25% over the course of the year. This gain notwithstanding, we see room for further share price appreciation over time as SunTrust’s overall performance continues to improve – as we believe it will. In addition, the Board of Directors in February 2004 approved an 11% increase in the dividend on SunTrust common stock, bringing the annual dividend to $2.00 per share.

SunTrust Banks, Inc.
Annual Report 2003
1 Total revenue is comprised of net interest income (taxable-equivalent) and noninterest income.
2 In this report, SunTrust presents a return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities and a return on average realized equity. The foregoing numbers reflect adjustments to remove the effects of the ownership by the Company of 48.3 million shares of The Coca-Cola Company. The Company uses this information internally to gauge its actual performance in the industry. The Company believes that the return on average assets less the net unrealized gains on the securities portfolio is more indicative of the Company’s return on assets because it more accurately reflects the return on the assets that are related to the Company’s core businesses. The Company also believes that the return on average realized equity is more indicative of the Company’s return on equity because the excluded equity relates primarily to a long-term holding of a specific security.
3 The net interest margin and efficiency ratios are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) and annualized basis. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax-favored status of income from certain loans and investments. The Company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides relative comparison between taxable and non-taxable amounts.

 Financial Results
The year’s financial results are reviewed in great detail in the “Management Discussion & Analysis” that begins on page 15. In the spirit of openness in financial reporting, I invite you to review it carefully. For purposes of this letter, though, a quick overview of 2003 financial highlights is in order.
In general, our earnings improvement was based on solid, revenue-driven gains in our major lines of business, with particularly strong growth in sales- related revenues.
We saw year-over-year improvement in net interest income and, in par- ticular, in fee income where there was noticeable pick-up in fees related to improving equity markets. Because of investments we made in market-driven businesses, such as wealth management and capital markets services, SunTrust is particularly well positioned to benefit from a stronger stock market.
Improved Credit Quality
The credit quality picture got progressively better during the year. SunTrust continued to be well-served by our traditionally conservative risk posture and careful credit management. We are proud that during an economic cycle when other large U.S. banks were hit by serious credit problems, SunTrust’s credit quality remained “best in class” compared with both peer institutions and industry averages.
On a less positive note, loan demand in one important market segment, the large corporate market, was weak in 2003. This overshadowed quite healthy loan growth in other areas such as consumer, mortgage and commercial lending.
With our balance sheet positioned for rising interest rates, historically low rates had a dampening effect on our net interest margin, and thus on net inter- est income and earnings overall, especially during the first half of 2003. The good news is that this negative impact began to diminish – and in fact turned around – in the second half of the year. Signs were pointing to continued improvement as 2004 began.
Focus on Efficiency
Although we did a respectable job of keeping core operating expenses in check in 2003, further improving efficiency remains a critical corporate priority. To

 this end, we have a variety of efficiency-related programs in place and are confident they will yield increasingly tangible results.
SunTrust today is a much more cost-conscious operation than it was just a few years ago. Driving this point home is the fact that even as our assets have grown by 35% over the past five years, our total staff level has dropped by more than 9%. We accomplished this reduction through technology improvements and a disciplined approach to personnel management, not broad-scale layoffs that can affect employee morale and customer service.
Positive View of the Future
Looking ahead, although uncertainty is a fact of life in our industry, we at SunTrust are firmly focused on the future and feeling very good about it.
As in the past, we are fortunate to be able to draw on the resources of an experienced and active Board of Directors. We note with appreciation the service of A.W. Dahlberg, who retired from the Board in 2003. And we welcome as a director J. Hicks Lanier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oxford Industries, Inc. Mr. Lanier joined the Board in November 2003.
It is also appropriate to express appreciation to our shareholders for your confidence in our Company. A special word to shareholders who are not yet SunTrust customers: Please give us a chance to win your business. To shareholders that already are customers, and to other customers, we are pleased you have selected us to serve your financial needs. We will work hard to exceed your expectations.
Finally, my thanks goes to all our employees for a job well done in 2003. In the end, they really are the answer to the question: “Why SunTrust?”
