                Letter to our Shareholders
Stuart A. Miller
President and Chief Executive Officer Lennar Corporation
 Dear Shareholders:
Fiscal 2009 was a year of continued repositioning for our Company as we remained focused on adapting our business in light of the current economic landscape. Although we continue to face challenges from high unemployment, increased foreclosures and tightening credit standards, recent demand trends in many of the communities in which we are selling homes indicate that the markets are stabilizing and the housing market is beginning its road to recovery. We’ve continued to make meaningful progress by carefully managing our asset base, improving our homebuilding operating platform and reworking our joint ventures. The progress we have made has been substantial and will ultimately enable us to return to profitability.
Consistent with our long-standing strategy, the focus on our balance sheet was our top priority. In fiscal 2009, that meant:
• Maximizing our cash position by generating positive operating cash flows of $421 million
• Enhancing our balance sheet liquidity by:
- Issuing $225 million of stock under our $275
million equity draw down program
- Extending our debt maturities by issuing $400 million of senior notes maturing in 2017 while retiring $448 million of shorter term senior notes
and other debt
• Ending the year with $1.3 billion in homebuilding
cash and a homebuilding debt to total capital
position, net of homebuilding cash, of 36.9%
• Managing our inventory by matching our starts and closings and using below market financing and
incentives to sell homes and reduce cancellations
• Opportunistically purchasing new land for
future growth
• Expecting to receive a tax refund of $320 million
in early 2010 as a result of tax legislation enacted during our fourth quarter
With our balance sheet fortified with ample liquidity, we are positioned to make strategic investments that will create long-term shareholder value as we begin to grow again. We are beginning to see opportunities take
shape and our Divisions are beginning to underwrite and purchase new land on a conservative basis, which would produce a reasonable profit at today’s prices.
On the joint venture front, we have continued to meaningfully eliminate joint ventures in order to add clarity and simplicity to our operating program. Our focus in this area has really paid off. We have reduced the number of unconsolidated joint ventures to 62 from 270 at the peak in 2006. Many of the remaining joint ventures are strategic ventures that have already been reworked, and have assets that are well positioned for the future. At the end of 2009, our maximum recourse debt related to unconsolidated joint ventures was $288 million, down from $520 million a year ago and from $1.8 billion at the peak in 2006. We expect to continue to reduce this amount and the number of unconsolidated joint ventures as we move through 2010.
Relative to our homebuilding operating platform and repositioning the Company for profitability, we have made continued progress throughout 2009 by:
• Refining our product offering targeting first-time and value-oriented homebuyers
• Reducing the number of floor plans and rebidding and value engineering our product to increase efficiency and reduce costs
• Continuing to right size our overhead in each of our operating divisions and our corporate office
• Improving our pre-impairment homebuilding gross margin to 17.8% in the fourth quarter, which allowed us to return to a positive 1.6% pre-impairment operating margin
Although we made significant progress, our results reflect the challenging market conditions our Company continued to navigate throughout 2009:
• Revenues of $3.1 billion – down 32%
• Net loss of $417.1 million or $2.45 per share.
Our net loss includes $560.4 million in valuation adjustments and other write-offs and was partially offset by a benefit for income taxes of $314.3 million primarily due to a NOL carryback

                • Homebuilding operating loss of $647 million
• Deliveries of 11,478 homes – down 27%
• New orders of 11,510 homes – down 14%
As we enter a new year, the market and the overall economy appear to be in the early stages of stabilization, which is where recovery begins. This recovery is not presenting itself as a V-shaped return to better times, but instead is proving to be a rocky bottom with visibility obscured by more questions than answers. Nevertheless, as we continue to review our operations in the field, market-by-market, there are some common themes that appear to be forming a trend.
• Prices are no longer free falling downward and in fact, in many instances, are actually starting to stabilize and even trend mildly upward
• For the Company overall, sales incentives were $36,300 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2009, down from $42,200 per home delivered in the third quarter of 2009, and $51,400 per home delivered in the fourth quarter of 2008
• Our cancellation rate has decreased to 18% from 26% a year ago
• The $8,000 tax credit is facilitating an inventory clearing process and will help enable a return to normalcy when the credit expires in the Spring
• Consumer confidence is increasing and there is a tangible sense that with prices and interest rates low, now is the right time to purchase a home
This improved sentiment is driving new purchasers to
the market and traffic is improving. This reflected itself during the fourth quarter of 2009 when we experienced our first year-over-year increase in new orders since our first quarter of 2006.
The distress in the market has presented numerous opportunities to acquire new properties that can add to profitability starting in 2010. We have begun to purchase land assets to replace closeout communities and add new well located communities. The majority of these acquisitions are finished homesites where we can start building homes immediately. Many of these acquisitions have been structured as rolling options where we have a minimal deposit with a flexible takedown schedule.
The prices for these acquisitions are a fraction of what they were at the peak of the market because land owners have recalibrated their thinking to the reality of today’s market. Accordingly, the ratio of the finished homesite in
relation to the sales price of the home is lower than the historical average and in many instances, a portion of the homesite purchase price is paid when the home is delivered to the homebuyer.
Additionally, we’ve continued to mature our distressed asset strategy under the banner of Rialto. We’ve been preparing to be a significant participant in the distressed opportunities that naturally present themselves in down cycles. The team is formed and at the beginning of our 2010 fiscal year we announced that, in partnership with the FDIC, we acquired for approximately $243 million indirect 40% managing member interests in limited liability companies created to hold two portfolios of real estate loans with a combined unpaid balance of $3.05 billion. Acquiring and working out distressed real estate loans was a large and extremely profitable part of our business during the last major real estate down cycle in the early 1990s. We are excited to return to this business and honored to partner with the FDIC to manage, work through and add value to the portfolio of loans. This distressed business will create additional income streams for the Company while generating new opportunities and creating significant shareholder value.
As we commence fiscal 2010, our hard work and intense focus on improving margins is producing results and positioning our Company for fundamental profitability. Although there remain headwinds for the economy and housing market overall, with a strong balance sheet and dedicated team of Associates, we are well positioned to grow our business in 2010.
Sincerely,
Stuart A. Miller
President and Chief Executive Officer Lennar Corporation
