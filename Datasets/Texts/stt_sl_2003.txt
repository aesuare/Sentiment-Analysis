                                          TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS
 > THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC, FINANCIAL AND GEOPOLITICAL ENVIRONMENTS WERE FRAGILE IN 2003. ALTHOUGH ECONOMIC NEWS WAS LARGELY POSITIVE, THE LINGERING CONFLICT IN IRAQ AND CONTROVERSY IN THE MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY CREATED A SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY FOR INVESTORS.
FOR STATE STREET, THE YEAR WAS ANYTHING BUT “BUSINESS AS USUAL.” WE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO INTEGRATE THE LARGEST ACQUISITION IN OUR HISTORY WHILE CONTINUING TO PROVIDE EXCELLENT SERVICE TO OUR EXISTING CLIENTS. WE ALSO WON SIGNIFICANT NEW BUSINESS AND MADE SUBSTANTIAL HEADWAY IN REDUCING OUR UNIT COSTS.
 > FINANCIAL RESULTS
Net income for 2003, including non-operating gains and charges, was $722 million, down from $1.0 billion in 2002. Total revenue rose 8 percent to $4.7 billion from $4.4 billion in 2002.
Operating earnings per share increased 8 percent to $2.33 in 2003, from $2.16 in 2002, marking our 26th year of consistent growth. Operating revenue was $4.5 billion, an increase from $3.9 billion in 2002.
During the year, we delivered operating return on equity of 15 percent, which was within our stated goal. The increase in State Street’s cash dividend brought our 10-year compounded average annual growth rate to 16 percent.
Assets under custody were $9.4 trillion at December 31, 2003, up 52 percent year over year from $6.2 trillion, due in large part to our acquisition of Deutsche Bank’s Global Securities Services business. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion at December 31, 2003, up 45 percent from $763 billion as of year-end 2002.
> BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
With the acquisition of the Global Securities Services (GSS) business in early 2003, State Street became the world’s leading servicer of investment assets. At year-end, the GSS business contributed $.01 per share to earnings – better than our original expectation – and we were ahead of schedule in converting client accounts to State Street.
We sharpened our focus on serving the needs of institutional investors by selling our Private Asset Management business. We also deepened our client relationships, with about half of new revenue growth, excluding GSS, coming from existing clients. Our sales pipeline was robust across all business areas and major markets.
The uncertainty of the environment and weak first-quarter results prompted us to take steps to reduce our operating run rate. We cut our direct controllable expenses and significantly reduced our headcount through a separation program implemented at the end of June.

                                           > OUTLOOK FOR 2004
We expect 2004 to be a challenging year, but believe that State Street is in an excellent position to continue to prosper and grow. A factor working in our favor – and a competitive differentiator for State Street – is our active, long-term relationship with our clients, who are some of the most sophisticated investors in the world. State Street is an essential component in these institutional investors’ strategies. The solutions we provide make them more successful in meeting their goals.
As we move into 2004, we are focused on a number of priorities. Our primary financial goal is to continue to achieve growth in operating earnings per share. We’ll meet that goal by seizing opportunities to boost our revenue – especially by obtaining more business from existing clients, including those who came to us in the GSS acquisition – and by continuing to control our expenses.
Another priority for us is to maintain our long tradition of integrity, innovation and service excellence. Our passion for helping our clients succeed differentiates State Street in the global marketplace. We will continue to work resolutely to ensure that we not only meet our clients’ current needs, but anticipate their future needs as well.
I am proud of State Street’s performance in 2003 and of the 20,000 State Street people around the world who produce outstanding results for our clients each and every day. I am both confident and energized about our prospects for the future.
Thank you for your investment in State Street.
Sincerely,
David A. Spina
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
