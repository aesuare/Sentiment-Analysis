MDC

LETTER FROM MANAGEMENT

EXCEPTIONAL RESULTS MDC's 2004 performance surpassed expectations and was the most successful of our 33 years in business. While delivering on our commitment to provide high-quality homes with excellent service to our customers, we achieved record results by virtually all measures, including returns for our shareowners that rank among the best in our industry. Earnings per share grew 79%, from $4.90 to $8.79, establishing MDC as the number one growth company among public homebuilders in 2004. Our net income reached an historical high of $391 million in 2004, our seventh consecutive record year and 84% greater than the previous record of $212 million we set in 2003. Also, we achieved total revenues of $4.0 billion, a year-over-year increase of 37%. And our home gross margins reached 27.7% in 2004, up an impressive 360 basis points over 2003. Our strong backlog at the beginning of the year, valued at $1.6 billion allowed us to deliver 13,876 home closings in 2004, 24% higher than the 11,211 home closings in 2003. Our 2004 home orders grew 13% to 14,248, fueled by increased activity in several of our new markets, as well as strong demand for homes and a greater number of active subdivisions in most of our existing markets. STRENGTHENED FINANCIAL POSITION Strengthening our balance sheet continues to be one of our top priorities:  In April, we increased the capacity of our homebuilding line of credit to $700 million and extended the maturity date to April 2009. In January 2005, we further increased our line of credit to over $1 billion with the ability to expand the amount to $1.25 billion with lender approval.  In the fourth quarter, we enhanced our financial flexibility by expanding our shelf registration to $1 billion, with $500 million earmarked for our medium-term notes program.

 We took advantage of a relatively low interest rate environment by issuing $250 million of ten-year, 5.375% medium-term senior notes in December.  Our cash and borrowing capacity at the end of 2004 totaled more than $1 billion, with no outstanding borrowings on our $700 million homebuilding credit facility.  Stockholders' equity at December 31, 2004 increased 40% year-over-year to $1.4 billion.  We increased the number of lots controlled for future home construction by more than 45% in 2004, yet our year-end debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash, of .19 is one of the lowest in our industry. This conservative capital structure, combined with our disciplined approach to expansion, are key distinguishing characteristics that have established us as one of only six investment grade companies in the homebuilding industry. NATIONWIDE EXPANSION During 2004, MDC took advantage of a convergence of favorable conditions that reward well-capitalized builders, including improved consumer confidence and job creation, the constrained supply of land, strong buyer demand in most major metropolitan areas of the country, and low mortgage rates. These conditions, together with our disciplined growth policies, helped us to achieve our expansion objectives without compromising our balance sheet. We continued to diversify geographically throughout 2004 through a combination of growth in our long-standing markets and increased production from our newer markets. During the third quarter, we acquired control of approximately 2,000 lots from Watson Home Builders in Jacksonville, which should position the Company among the three largest homebuilders in that market in 2005. Also in the third quarter, through our transaction with Patriot Homes and others, we gained control

of approximately 600 lots in New Jersey. In addition, we established a fourth division in Southern California to capitalize on the fast-growing Inland Empire market. And in January 2005, we acquired the rights to purchase 1,200 lots in California's Central Valley from Del Valle Homes. After entering seven new markets during the previous three years, and with our significant expansion in Nevada, Arizona, California and Virginia, MDC is no longer considered a "Colorado homebuilder." Such diversification enables us to mitigate the short term impact of local market fluctuations and has created significant growth opportunities for our Company. Our new operations in Texas, Utah and Florida accounted for nearly 1,800 home closings and over 2,000 home orders in 2004, with even greater contributions expected in 2005. INCREASING SHAREOWNER VALUE Once again, during 2004, we made significant advances toward achieving our primary objective of increasing shareowner value:  In December, we declared a 1.3 for 1 stock split, which was preceded by a 10% stock dividend declared in February.  Our quarterly cash dividend increased 72% in the last year and effectively tripled over the last 24 months.  MDC repurchased 155,000 shares of MDC common stock at an average price of $44, well below the current market price.  Our 2004 after-tax return on equity increased 900 basis points from 2003 to 33%, one of the highest among our peers.

 Our market capitalization increased 32% during the year, as our stock price reached an all-time high of $67 in the fourth quarter. This year-over-year increase in market capitalization was one of the highest among companies in our industry during 2004. VISIBILITY TO FUTURE GROWTH To support our future growth, we increased our lots under control to nearly 42,000 by the end of 2004. More than 50% of these lots were optioned, compared with only 29% just 15 months earlier. We finished the year with 242 active subdivisions, up 22% over the last 12 months, and we expect to reach 300 active subdivisions before the end of 2005. In addition, our year-end backlog of 6,505 homes with an estimated sales value of nearly $2 billion has enabled us to begin 2005 in a position of strength. Our results in 2004 are evidence that our disciplined operating strategy, geographic expansion and commitment to excellence across all facets of our business are succeeding. We would like to express our sincere thanks to all of our shareowners for their support of MDC. In addition, we thank our employees, Board of Directors and business partners for their contributions and dedication to our success. Together, we look forward to another prosperous year in 2005.
