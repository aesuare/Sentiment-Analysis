   To Our Shareholders
The people of La-Z-Boy delivered exceptional performance in fiscal 2016, marking the fifth consecutive year of increased sales and operating income for the company.
Our multifaceted growth strategy, combined with effective execution, is producing consistent positive results for our shareholders. At the same time, we are delivering on our corporate vision – “to enrich people’s lives by turning houses into homes” – by providing consumers with great product, services, comfort and quality. The ability to satisfy both our shareholders and customers simultaneously, while also creating an inspiring place to work for our employees, gives us tremendous satisfaction.
Driven by an innovative spirit found deep within our company’s history and culture, today our philosophy and business model are as modern as ever. The combination of our strong foundation, built over almost 90 years, with a forward-thinking team of professionals across our company, positions us well for ongoing success.
