To Our Fellow Shareholders March 3, 2003
In 2001, we examined every Chemed operation and began implementing corporate-wide restructuring initiatives. We pared noncore and underperforming businesses, refinanced debt, and restructured various headquarters’ costs. These measures bore fruit in 2002, and your company is a leaner, more effective business today. Our 2002 financial results showed improvement, and Chemed’s balance sheet is stronger yet.
Financial Results
For the year ended December 31, 2002, Chemed recorded a net loss of $.18 per share as compared with a net loss of $1.07 per share in 2001. The net loss for 2002 included income from discontinued operations of $.64 per share, capital gains from sales of investments of $.08 per share, investment impairment charges of $.08 per share, and goodwill impairment charges of $2.06 per share. Net income for 2001 included aftertax restructuring and other charges of $1.74 per share, a loss of $.15 per share from discontinued operations, goodwill amortization of $.40 per share, an extra- ordinary loss of $.18 per share in debt prepayment penalties, and capital gains from sales of investments of $.07 per share.
On a pro forma basis excluding capital gains, restructuring and other charges, amortization of good- will, and impairment charges, Chemed’s earnings from continuing operations were $1.24 per share for 2002 as compared with $1.33 per share for 2001.
Service revenues and sales from continuing opera- tions for 2002 were $314.2 million, 7% below 2001’s $337.9 million. For 2002, earnings from continuing operations before impairment charges, capital gains, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were $37.3 million versus EBITDA of $26.6 million for 2001, and for 2002, EBITDA represented 12% of revenues. Pro forma EBITDA for 2001, which
exclude all restructuring and other charges, amounted to $41.8 million, or 12% of revenues.
Operations
We are encouraged by Chemed’s operational results, which were achieved in difficult economic conditions. Our flagship Roto-Rooter operation generated income of $15.4 million in 2002.
Roto-Rooter’s income of $15.4 million compares favorably with net income of $3.4 million in 2001. The 2001 net income included $10.4 million in charges related to restructuring and goodwill amortization of $3.1 million. Excluding these charges, Roto-Rooter generated $16.9 million of income in 2001.
Revenues for Roto-Rooter amounted to $253.7 million in 2002, $15.7 million, or 6%, below the prior year’s revenues of $269.4 million. During 2002, Roto-Rooter exited underperforming, non-Roto-Rooter- branded operations, which accounted for the
majority of the revenue decline. Softening demand for Roto-Rooter’s nonemergency services accounted for the remainder. Good expense control, along with the posi- tive earnings impact from exiting the non-Roto-Rooter- branded operations, partially offset the effects of the revenue decline on earnings.
In order to overcome the soft economy, Roto-Rooter will continue to concentrate efforts in the areas it can impact: increasing sales to commercial accounts, improving service technician productivity, and control- ling expenses at all levels. To further counteract the economic slowdown, Roto-Rooter must increase the number of inbound calls for service. Toward that end, Roto-Rooter is investing heavily to improve its ad placement in its primary marketing vehicle, phone directories. In addition, the toll-free 1-800-GET-ROTO number is featured on all packages of Roto-Rooter’s new retail products, plus coupons for discounted service

 are included on the new Roto-Rooter® Clog Remover. These initiatives should put the Roto-Rooter name prominently in front of consumers and, in turn, create top-of-mind awareness when service is needed.
We are confident Roto-Rooter’s critical issues are being addressed and that providing excellent service at a fair price will ultimately result in job count and sales growth over the long term.
Service America recorded a loss of $20.0 million in 2002 as a result of a goodwill impairment charge of $20.3 million. This compares with a loss of $686,000 in 2001. Before impairment and restructuring charges and amortization of goodwill, Service America’s earnings in 2002 were $381,000 as compared with $1.8 million in 2001. Revenues at Service America declined from $68.6 million in 2001 to $60.5 million in 2002, as the company continued to eliminate unprofitable service contracts. With the contract base representing the greatest opportunity for retail sales, this planned reduction in service agreements also led to a decline
in retail sales. At the same time, Service America experienced increased labor and materials costs, the net result being a decline in the gross margin of 3.1 percentage points in 2002. Service America’s multiyear review of its contracts has culminated in a new
pricing strategy that should yield improved results for the company.
Financial Position
Chemed is on solid financial footing. In October 2002, we sold our Patient Care home-healthcare subsidiary, yielding net proceeds of $70.2 million and putting Chemed in an excellent cash position. Additionally, since 1991, Chemed has maintained a $31.3 million investment in the preferred stock and warrants of Vitas Healthcare Corporation, a leading provider of hospice care serving more than 35,000
patients and their families annually. This asset yields 8% aftertax on the Vitas preferred dividend and represents a potential source of future capital gains or equity earnings.
As a result, today Chemed’s balance sheet is extremely healthy as evidenced by a current ratio of 1.4 and a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 11% at December 31, 2002. Cash balances exceed long-term debt, giving Chemed the resources to support its subsidiaries’ growth, pursue its acquisition strategy targeting Roto-Rooter franchises, and consider opportunities in related industries.
Dividend Increase
Attesting to its confidence in Chemed’s solid finan- cial position and future earnings potential, in the 2002 fourth quarter, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend rate 9%, from $.11 per share to $.12 per share. Further, including the March 10, 2003, dividend payment, Chemed has paid 127 consecutive quarterly dividends in 31 years as a public corporation, providing shareholders with a tangible cash return on their investment.
Outlook
We recognize that 2003 will be another challenging year for Chemed’s operations, but we believe our initiatives have strengthened Chemed’s businesses. Your company is a much better, leaner company today than it was a year ago, and with a little help from the economy, we are positioned to leverage sales growth into profit growth over the long term.
