REBOUND YEAR
Fiscal 2005 was a strong rebound year for ADP. We are back on a solid growth trend and are gaining momentum. In fiscal 2005, our revenues grew 10% to $8.5 billion and our earnings per share reached an all-time record level of $1.79 per share with 15% growth. We achieved these results while maintaining our ever more rare position
as one of six AAA-rated U.S. industrial companies by the major rating agencies.
ADP has been a consistent growth company for many years. So, it is important to understand that our fiscal 2005 results are not a one-time event. The foundation for the future is solid. Our forecast for fiscal 2006 is for high single-digit growth to over $9 billion in annual revenues and earnings per share growth of 15%-20%, assuming stock compensation was expensed in fiscal 2005. Excluding stock compensation expense in both periods, we anticipate growth in earnings per share would have been 12%-15%.

                                         “We have had excellent execution around the basics of our businesses. Client service levels and client retention rates reached new levels.”
WHY ARE WE SO CONFIDENT?
We are confident about the near-term future for four primary reasons.
! The economic headwinds are diminishing, which helps us primarily in our Employer Services business. We see the results in increased sales, growth in pays per control (the number of employees on our clients’ payrolls), fewer companies going out of business which helps client retention, and increased client funds balances on which we earn interest.
@ Over the past two years we have had a sizeable increase in our investment in targeted growth initiatives, primarily benefiting our sales organizations and high-potential products and services. The timing of these investments turned out to be remarkably good given the economic rebound.
# The Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates on June 30, 2004 and has now increased the rate ten times to a 31⁄2% rate. Since our average daily balances of corporate and client funds exceed $15 bil- lion, the increase in rates had a small but growing impact in fiscal 2005 and will have a greater impact in fiscal 2006.
$ We have had excellent execution around the basics of our businesses. Client service levels and client retention rates reached new levels. Sales (annualized recurring revenues from new orders) rebounded in our largest business, Employer Services,
to double-digit growth levels reaching over $840 million. This is our first double-digit sales growth year since fiscal 2000. Our product and service offerings position us very well in virtually every market in which we compete. Associate longevity and retention remained at high levels and are the key to our excellent execution.
We are also excited about our longer-term strategies that are aimed at accelerating our revenue growth. We see opportunities for extending growth beyond the intrinsic growth of our markets and our ability to gain share by out-executing our competitors. There are four major areas of incremental focus.
! The BPO, or Business Process Outsourcing, market is a large additional opportunity. We have entered this market with our Comprehensive Outsourcing Services solution in Employer Services and Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services in Brokerage. We plan to increase our investment and broaden our offerings.
@ In our Employer Services business we expanded our alliance with SAP for a global human resource solution and we established an agreement with Microsoft which includes ADP Payroll as part of their thrust into the small business market (see pages 10 and 11 for further description). We will continue to seek major alliance opportunities with additional market-leading partners.

# We will expand our global presence. While international expansion takes time and investment, we have proven that our business models can succeed throughout the world. We will both enter new countries and expand our investments in existing locations.
$ We will increase our emphasis on acquisi- tions, including a focus on transactions larger than our historical experience and entry into adjacent markets where we bring some important synergies.
CULTURE
At a recent management meeting, we tackled the issue of culture and highlighted several underlying “truths” in the ADP world. We thought we would share them with you.
! Increasing long-term shareholder value as our primary objective.
@ Each client counts ... supported by World Class Service and Product Leadership.
# Engaged associates drive results.
$ Uncompromising ethics and integrity. % Reputation is everything.
^ Trust in leadership.
While a discussion of each point would be too lengthy, we hope you understand the message.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH
ADP has a very strong financial position and cash flow.
• 90% recurring revenue.
• Cash flow from operations was strong at $1.4 billion and included $0.2 billion of net cash used for our new Securities Clearing and Outsourcing Services segment.
• We acquired over 14 million ADP shares for approximately $600 million.
• Cash and marketable securities at year-end were $2.1 billion.
• Long-term debt was very low at about $76 million.
• Return on equity grew to almost 19%.
• Our Board increased ADP’s dividend 11% to $0.62 per share, the 30th consecutive year of dividend increases; over $350 million was returned to our shareholders in fiscal 2005.
• We are one of only six remaining AAA-rated U.S. industrial companies by the major rating agencies.

                                         IMPORTANCE OF
PEOPLE AND LEADERSHIP
Nothing is more important to ADP’s continued success than our 44,000 associates around the globe who continually strive to provide quality products and world class service
to our 590,000 clients. Our associates
are exceptionally client-oriented, motivated, committed, and dedicated. They are the reason we win in the marketplace.
This year we announced the promotions of John Gleason, Regina Lee, Alan Sheiness, and Jan Siegmund to Corporate Officer in recognition of their important contributions to our success.
We also are very pleased to have added John Jones to our Board of Directors. John is currently the Chairman and CEO of Air Products and Chemicals.
Joe Califano, who has been a director of ADP since 1982, retired from the Board this year. We will miss Joe’s valuable insights and many contributions.
