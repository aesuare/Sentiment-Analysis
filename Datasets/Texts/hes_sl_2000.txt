To Our Stockholders
 The year 2000 was an extraordinary year for Amerada Hess.
• We achieved record after-tax earnings of $1.023 billion ($11.38 per share), a 20% return on average capital employed.
• We increased production to 374,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day from 339,000 barrels per day in 1999, a 10% increase.
• We began construction of the coking unit at our HOVENSA joint venture Virgin Islands refinery.
• We significantly expanded our retail marketing network.
• We repurchased 3,444,000 shares of Common Stock for $220 million.
We enter 2001 confident that we will have another year of strong earnings and production growth. We have a strong balance sheet and are poised to take steps for further growth and profitability. We continue to strive for excellence in our environmental, health and safety performance.
EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
In 2000, we achieved a 29% return on capital employed in exploration and production. Exploration and production will continue to be the primary vehicle for future income and growth. We will balance our efforts among exploration drilling, reserve development opportunities and acquisitions. We believe that increasing our international portfolio of lower-cost, long-life reserves and our exposure to natural gas in the United States is the best way to create value in our upstream business.
Major milestones in 2000 included the successful development of the Conger and Northwestern Fields in the Gulf of Mexico, which will add about 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to our United States production, the acquisition of the Gassi El Agreb redevelopment project in Algeria, which will add current net production of about 14,000 barrels of oil per day, and the acquisition of an additional interest in the Azeri, Chirag and Guneshli Fields in Azerbaijan, which offer lower-cost, long-life reserves. Early this year, the Atora Field in Gabon came onstream.
We recently reached agreement to purchase natural gas properties onshore and offshore Louisiana for approximately $750 million. Net production from these properties will average about 200,000 Mcf of natural gas equivalent per day in 2001 and peak at about 250,000 Mcf per day in 2003. Early in 2001, we also acquired Gulf of Mexico properties that will have net production of about
  2

30,000 Mcf of natural gas equivalent per day in 2001. Both acquisitions offer excellent financial returns, production upside and increased exposure to United States natural gas markets.
We expect our daily production to increase by about 12% to 420,000 bar- rels of oil equivalent per day in 2001 as a result of past exploration successes, field redevelopments and production from these acquisitions. We anticipate a further production increase in 2002. The per barrel profitability of our pro- duction, after eliminating the impact of higher crude oil and natural gas prices, has risen dramatically since we reshaped our upstream asset base. Management remains committed to enhancing financial returns.
We replaced 129% of our production in 2000. However, we have not been sat- isfied with the results of our exploration program. During 2000, we brought in new management for our United States and international exploration pro- grams. We are confident that the new exploration leadership will improve our exploration success rate and move us toward our finding cost target.
During 2000, Amerada Hess made an offer for LASMO plc, a United Kingdom exploration and production company with significant international activities. We withdrew our offer in the face of a higher bid that would not have met our financial return standards and, we believe, would not have been in the best interests of our shareholders. We will continue to be disciplined and pursue acquisitions that meet our financial standards.
REFINING AND MARKETING
Our challenge in refining and marketing has been to achieve double-digit returns on capital employed in a business that has traditionally suffered from low margins and relatively poor financial performance. We successfully met this challenge in 2000. While returns were enhanced by improved refining margins, our refining and marketing financial results, relative to competitors, have improved dramatically since we reshaped our downstream asset base. Our return on capital employed from refining and marketing operations exceeded 12% in 2000.
Construction of the 58,000 barrel per day delayed coking unit and related facilities has begun at the Virgin Islands refinery. The unit, which is sched- uled to be completed during the second quarter of 2002, will further enhance financial returns.

We continue to invest in retail marketing because we believe that over time this business can deliver superior financial returns. In 2000, we acquired 178 Merit retail facilities, greatly strengthening our business in the metropolitan Philadelphia, New York and Boston markets. We have rebranded nearly all of these HESS.
We have reached agreement to form a joint venture to own and operate 141 WILCO retail facilities, which are located primarily in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. The gasoline will be sold under the HESS brand. We also have agreed to purchase 53 Gibbs retail facilities, located primarily in the Boston metropolitan area and southern New Hampshire. We will rebrand them HESS. At the end of 2001, we expect to have about 1,150 HESS retail facilities, more than double the number at the end of 1996, and we will be the leading independent convenience retail marketer on the East Coast.
During 2000, we continued to expand our energy marketing business. Sales of distillates and residual fuel oil increased as a result of colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2000. Natural gas sales to industrial and commercial customers were in excess of 500,000 Mcf per day at year-end 2000. We also invested in innovative technologies to make alternate sources of energy avail- able to our customers. We are manufacturing and marketing to industrial and commercial customers a cogeneration unit that generates electricity and ther- mal energy. We made an investment in a fuel cell company that designs and develops integrated fuel cell systems capable of using multiple fuels to pro- duce cleaner energy for both the stationary and vehicular markets.
CURRENT RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS
At its March 7, 2001 meeting, the Corporation’s Board of Directors increased the regular quarterly dividend on the Common Stock to 30 cents per share from 15 cents per share. The Board’s action reflects the Corporation’s contin- uing commitment to increasing current returns to shareholders, the Corporation’s sound financial condition and the positive outlook for the future.
In 2000, the Corporation’s Board of Directors authorized the expenditure of $300 million to repurchase shares of Amerada Hess Common Stock. During 2000, $220 million was spent, leaving $80 million available for continued share repurchases. Management and the Board of Directors continue to believe that the Corporation’s Common Stock is an excellent investment.
