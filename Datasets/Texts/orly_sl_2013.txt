O’REILLY AUTOMOTIVE 2013 ANNUAL REPORT 3
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
It is our pleasure to report another year
of outstanding financial results to you, our shareholders, and we would like to thank our dedicated Team Members for once again outworking our competitors and providing the best customer service in the industry. We entered the year with a long tradition of excellent financial performance, having generated comparable store sales growth and increases in revenues and operating margin each year since becoming a public company in 1993, and in 2013 Team O’Reilly stepped up to the plate and delivered another record breaking year. Our financial performance in 2013 was highlighted by a robust 27% increase in diluted earnings per share – our fifth consecutive year of 25% or greater adjusted earnings per share growth.
2013 Results At the core of our team’s ability to out-pace our industry year in and year out is our unwavering, unrelenting commitment to customer service; however, our robust sales performance certainly does not come easily and our passion for taking care of every customer was the driving force behind our industry leading comparable store sales growth of 4.3%. Although the U.S. economy has shown some signs of a modest recovery, our customer continues to face pressure from historically high unemployment and underemployment, and the competition for their business is fierce. This challenging economic environment has constrained the overall growth in the automotive aftermarket, as evident in the number of miles driven in the U.S. and the reported results of our public competitors. Our team’s ability to deliver solidly positive comparable store sales growth, while the rest of the marketplace struggles to remain flat, is a clear indication we are capturing market share. Our performance leads our industry simply because we provide the best customer service – it is ingrained in the fiber of the Team O’Reilly Culture. That Culture is no more evident than in our commitment to promote from within. Our executive and senior management teams have average tenures of 23 and 16 years in our company, respectively, and a

our robust growth in improved acquisition costs. Our operating discipline extends to the management of our operating expenses. Our strategy is to improve the productivity of our operating expenses over the long term by leveraging our costs on improved sales volumes, however, we have not and will not sacrifice the service we provide to our customers to drive short-term improvements in our numbers.
Our stores offer an extensive selection of automotive parts, tools, supplies, equipment, accessories, and enhanced services and programs to both do-it-yourself and professional service provider customers. Our highly-trained, technically-proficient Professional Parts People are committed to providing consistently superior service to each of our customers every day.

O’Rewards, our customer loyalty program launched in 2013, rewards our retail customers with enhanced benefits including cash discounts off future purchases, member-only offers and surprise and delight targeted promotions.

executing our proven growth strategy. The most important component to that strategy has been, and will continue to be, growing our market share in existing stores by simply outworking our competitors and providing better customer service. Our dual market business model of serving both professional service providers and do-it-yourselfers with the best inventory availability and knowledgeable parts professionals has proven to be the most effective model in our industry, and the most difficult to duplicate. Our robust, regional, tiered distribution infrastructure enables us to provide five-night-a-week delivery service to our stores, supplemented in the majority of our stores with multiple daily deliveries of must-have parts from our local distribution center or hub store. This robust distribution network reflects a significant capital investment, but the
 significant majority of these managers started in our business in a customer service position in one of our stores.
The leadership of our company has grown up in the parts business...and it shows. Our excellent customer service is not
a program or a corporate initiative, it
is the hard-earned product of the years of experience we have in offering
our customers great advice and great parts, every day. We have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to successfully perpetuate our Culture as we open new stores and integrate acquisitions – Excellent Customer Service is simply who we are, and it will remain at the heart and soul of our Company.
Another key component of the O’Reilly Culture is our relentless expense control focus, which, coupled with our strong and profitable sales growth, drove a 13% increase in operating profit to a record 16.6% as a percentage of sales. To provide a little historical perspective, the 16.6% operating margin result is a 450 basis point improvement over our 12.1% operating margin from just six years ago. Our outstanding results have been driven by our commitment to profitable growth and are the result of our discipline in pursuing growth – we capture market share by providing better service, building long-term relationships and do not buy business with price. Our improved profitability in 2013 mirrored our long-term strategy. We drove improved gross margins by demonstrating the value for both our customers and suppliers; our customers benefited from our excellent service levels and technical knowledge, and we continue to see a higher mix of hard part sales, which carry a higher gross profit, while our supplier partners have shared the gains they have reaped from
Future Outlook As we look forward to 2014, we will continue to execute our business model and growth strategies with the goal of setting new records for growth and profitability. We remain very confident in the health of the automotive aftermarket, principally supported by the stability of miles driven and continued aging of the vehicle fleet. Vehicles manufactured today can be reasonably expected to stay on the road at high mileages because of the quality of the power trains, interiors and exteriors, and, as a result, vehicle owners are willing to invest in routine maintenance and repairs on older vehicles with an expectation that their vehicle will remain a reliable source of transportation. This combination of the durability of vehicles, and the value proposition it creates for consumers, continues to push out the age at which vehicles are sent to the junk yard, and has resulted in very stable scrappage rates,
and we expect for this trend to continue. We are also optimistic about the increasing trend in new vehicle sales. Stronger new car sales point to improving consumer confidence and overall economic health and, combined with stable, low scrappage rates, leads to a growing population of total vehicles. Unemployment improved modestly in 2013 and we expect to continue to see steady improvements in commuter miles as the economy recovers and more individuals return to work. An increasing population of vehicles and total miles driven in the U.S. are strong catalysts for increased demand for the parts we sell and we remain extremely confident in the long-term prospects of the aftermarket.
Growing Market Share Against the backdrop of strong automotive aftermarket fundamentals, we are poised to continue to outpace our industry by

large breadth of inventory we offer builds strong relationships with both our do-it-yourself and professional service provider customers, because we can deliver the right part to our customers quicker than our competitors.
We also drive growth in our existing store base by continually enhancing the in-store experience of our customers through refinements to our systems and new programs to enhance the already excellent service we provide to our customers. One of these new programs we rolled out in late 2013 was our O’Rewards Customer Loyalty Program, and we are thrilled with the initial response from our customers
to this new initiative. Our O’Rewards program rewards our loyal customers with rebates based on their purchases and targeted “surprise and delight” promotions tailored to their individual

DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
Our robust, regional, tiered distribution network provides our stores with same-day
or overnight access to hard-to-find parts
not routinely stocked at the store level and enables us to optimize product availability and inventory levels throughout our store network. Our three new distribution centers in Florida, Illinois and Massachusetts, opening in 2014, will have a combined capacity to service more than 750 stores. These new DCs will provide our existing stores with a more robust same-day inventory availability and still support our future store growth and help drive our continued market share gains.
preferences. This program will solidify our engagement with our customers and help us capture a larger percentage of their business, while also providing us with valuable information about our customer’s buying habits. O’Rewards is just one example of Team O’Reilly’s dedication to our customers and our commitment to becoming the dominant auto parts supplier in all of our markets.
New Store Expansion Executing our business model and providing excellent customer service in every one of our stores will always be our top priority and we have proven our ability, over the course of our history, to add very profitable new stores without missing a beat. Our new store growth has been successful because we do not compromise our proven model in order to drive unit growth numbers. For each new store we

open, we aggressively identify and develop a knowledgeable and enthusiastic team of parts professionals to provide unsurpassed customer service from day one. Having distribution capacity across our chain has allowed us to spread out our new store growth, allowing us to be selective not only in the sites we develop, but also, just as importantly, in the new store teams we build. In 2014, we will add new stores in several existing market areas, with strong growth in Texas and California, and in new geographic regions, with expansion in growth markets in Florida and the upper Midwest. Our new stores in existing markets are some of the strongest out of the gate as they benefit from our existing strong brand presence and management

support infrastructure. We support our new market growth by opening stores in contiguous geographic areas to our existing distribution network, providing the same five-night-a-week delivery our existing markets receive. We also frequently support a new market area with the addition of a hub store in the first wave of store openings. We only have one chance to make a first impression, and we make sure we have availability to be the best parts provider as soon as we enter a new market.
Capturing market share in existing stores and opening successful new stores is highly dependent on a strong distribution network, and we have three new

distribution centers opening in 2014 which will provide us with the additional capacity necessary to grow and to continue to lead the industry in inventory availability. We opened our 25th DC in Lakeland, Florida, in January of 2014. This DC will support our expansion into Central and Southern Florida, and we have been very pleased with the progress of the stores we have added in these markets. Our second new DC will open in the third quarter of 2014 just outside of Chicago, Illinois. This new DC will provide us with a strategic advantage by positioning more than 150,000 SKUs in close proximity to the huge car population in the important Chicagoland market, while also freeing up distribution capacity to support additional growth in several of our existing midwestern facilities. Our final project to be completed in 2014 will be the opening of a new DC just outside of Boston, Massachusetts. This new DC will open in the back half of 2014 and will initially service the stores acquired in the VIP acquisition, with significant additional capacity to support continued expansion in the northeast beginning in 2015 and beyond. Constructing, stocking and staffing more than 1.1 million additional square feet of distribution capacity in one year is a huge undertaking, but our distribution team has a proven track record of bringing new DCs online without a hitch.
Opportunistic Acquisitions The third prong of our proven growth strategy is the identification, acquisition, and integration of existing auto parts chains, and the multiple acquisition success stories in our history set the blueprint for our activity moving forward. The automotive aftermarket has consistently consolidated over the past decade, but remains a very fragmented industry with the top ten automotive aftermarket parts chains in the U.S. accounting for less than 50%
of the total number of outlets. This fragmentation is especially prevalent on the professional service provider side of the business, and we believe significant opportunity exists for O’Reilly to continue to consolidate the industry. Our historical success in opportunistic acquisitions is directly tied to the discipline we show in the deals we complete and the process we undertake to integrate the acquired chains. We constantly monitor the

EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM
With more than 300 years of automotive industry experience, O’Reilly’s executive management team provides something not all companies can claim – proven leaders who know the ins and outs of their business from having worked in virtually every facet of the Company.

aftermarket landscape for the right acquisition target, but we will only buy
at the right price – one that meets our stringent return metrics. We do not pursue acquisitions solely for the sake of growth. Once a deal is completed, our operations groups work diligently to quickly convert the physical plant of the acquired chain to O’Reilly’s systems, processes and procedures. Most importantly, however, we work from
day one of the acquisition to instill the O’Reilly Culture in each of our new Team Members. Our ability to successfully spread our Culture in acquisitions ranging in size from one store to 1,300 stores is the single most important factor in our past and future acquisition successes.
Financial Policy We are laser focused on executing our proven profitable growth model and our financial policies reflect that commitment. Our priorities for use of cash mirror our growth strategies with the top priority being investment in our existing store base to provide our teams with attractive stores, robust inventory availability and enhanced technology
to capture market share, followed by
new store growth and opportunistic acquisitions. In 2013, we successfully followed this playbook, capturing market share and generating industry leading 4.3% comparable store sales growth, while opening 190 new stores. This topline execution, along with disciplined expense control, generated free cash flow of $512 million in 2013.
We are also committed to managing
our capital structure to provide robust returns for shareholders, while prudently preserving our ability to invest in our business and take advantage of growth opportunities. To this end, we established a targeted leverage ratio of 2.00 to 2.25 times adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR at the beginning of 2011, which we believe reflects our current optimal capital structure, and we issued additional debt in June of 2013 in line with this target. With this issuance we had intended to enter our target range in 2013, but did not because of our very strong earnings results and we finished 2013 just below that range. Our continued strong performance and prudent financial management earned us an upgrade in our credit rating from Moody’s during 2013, moving the rating from Baa3 up to Baa2, and putting us on par with our BBB flat rating from S&P. Our investment grade ratings are a critical component of our overall capital structure and supplier financing programs, and we remain extremely committed to maintaining these ratings.
Our final priority for use of cash, after we have exhausted opportunities to invest in our business, is to return value to our shareholders in the form of our share repurchase program. In 2013, our strong free cash flow results and incremental debt issuance supported share repurchases totaling $933 million. Since the inception of our Board-approved share repurchase
program in January of 2011, we have repurchased more than 40 million of our shares, at an average price of $82.61 per share, for a total investment of $3.35 billion. We believe this program has created significant value for our shareholders, and we will continue to prudently repurchase shares with excess cash in 2014.
We remain very grateful to all of our shareholders for the continued trust you have placed in O’Reilly. We are very proud of our record-breaking performance in 2013 and remain committed to building upon this success in 2014 and beyond. Finally, we would once again like to thank our 62,000 Team Members for their unwavering passion for offering the highest level of customer service in the industry. You are the reason for our past success and our very bright future.
