Dear LP Shareholder,
2012 saw LP move from a company surviving in a weak market to one responding with agility to profit from the slight upturn in the housing market.
The U.S. housing downturn from 2006 through 2011 bottomed out and started to pick up momentum in 2012, ending the year with housing starts at an annual rate of 780,000. That’s more than 25 percent higher than 2011. With the increase in demand, LP showed the strongest financial results in several years. 2012 was the first full year since 2006 that we recorded positive earnings per share as well as net cash flow from operations of more than $100 million.
2012 also saw us record our second-best year for safety and we finished the year without a single notice of violation for any type of environmental excursion, a first for LP.
We ended the year very well positioned to take advantage of further improvements in the housing market. Our strong balance sheet includes more than $560 million of cash. We have clear plans and projects in place to address both any potential supply chain issues and the needs for increased production to serve our customers’ growing needs.
The investment community recognized this improved performance with our stock price showing a 139 percent increase in 2012.
2012 Financial Performance
For 2012, LP reported income from continuing operations of $32 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.7 billion. This compares to a loss of $172 million, or $1.29 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.4 billion for 2011. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the year was $203 million compared to a negative adjusted EBITDA of $5 million in 2011.
Cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2012 were $561 million, up from $340 million the previous year.
Segment Performance
Oriented Strand Board (OSB)
OSB had operating income of $124 million in 2012 compared to a loss of $64 million in 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was $166 million in 2012 compared to negative EBITDA of $18 million in 2011. Sales volumes increased 12 percent while sales prices increased 36 percent.
We operated seven OSB mills in 2012, but took steps to boost production by adding shifts in some mills and in Q4, took the initial steps to bring our Thomasville, Alabama OSB mill back online in 2013. We also announced plans to acquire full ownership of our Peace Valley OSB joint venture in British Columbia.
Siding
Siding reported sales of $501 million in 2012, up 17 percent from the prior year. Operating income was $67 million compared to $42 million in 2011. Siding’s adjusted EBITDA for 2012 was $83 million compared to $58 million in 2011.
The improvement in full year results is related not only to the higher activity in single family new construction, but also to the increased penetration of our LP SmartSide® strand product. Our market segment strategy provided strong growth in repair and remodel, and especially sheds.

Engineered Wood Products (EWP)
EWP was more affected by higher raw materials costs than our other segments. EWP recorded an operating loss of $14 million in 2012 compared to an operating loss of $16 million in 2011. 2012 sales were $213 million, up 5 percent from the prior year. EBITDA for 2012 and 2011 was negative $2 million.
Sales volume of I-joists was up 11 percent while volume for laminated strand lumber (LSL) and laminated veneer lumber (LVL) was up 4 percent for the year.
South America
2012 was a record year for LP South America. The South American team continues its history of building LP’s reputation and providing a growth engine for the company.
For the year, South America had operating income of $18 million compared to $12 million in 2011. Adjusted EBITDA was $30 million in 2012 compared to $23 million in 2011. Sales volumes in Chile and Brazil increased significantly, 19 percent in Chile and 12 percent in Brazil. Pricing in local currency also improved in both countries, 10 percent better in Chile in 2012 versus 2011 and up 9 percent in Brazil.
Our Chilean mills have been operating at capacity for several years, which led us to announce plans in 2012 to open a third mill. From past experience, relocating a refurbished mill to South America will take about two years and cost much less than building a brand new mill.
Going forward
LP remains focused on being safe, improving productivity, being agile and positioning ourselves to take advantage of the housing market upturn. We saw some of the fruits of that labor in 2012. In an improved but well below average housing market, LP set sales volume records in a number of product lines including our LP TopNotch® subflooring, LP TechShield® radiant barrier panels, LP SmartSide® strand-based siding, LP SolidStart® Laminated Strand Lumber, and LP FlameBlock®, our fire-rated OSB sheathing.
Our 2013 outlook is for higher housing starts, given that the average of third-party forecasts is now slightly above 1 million — still well below the 50-year average of 1.5 million. While we firmly believe we will see demand at this higher level, we will take a conservative tack and remain agile to respond to market volatility as we plan our business operations.
We met with our sales and marketing teams in January to discuss our plans for 2013. Their energy was inspiring and optimism was invigorating. There, Curt outlined how we could SQUISH any challenge that faces us.
Safety
Safety is a core value at LP and has helped blaze the trail for other initiatives that have made us a safer, more focused company. In 2012, LP employees ended the year with a total incident rate (TIR) of 0.46. Our OSB business had a single reportable injury during the year, which gave them a TIR of 0.08. About 60 percent of our sites had no reportable injuries in 2012. That’s a remarkable, industry-leading performance.
Quality of our products and services
Second only to safety among our core values is quality. Through initiatives such as LP by Me, we have raised quality to a higher level companywide. In 2012, we continued our evolution from primarily inspection- based systems to robust, multi-faceted systems that insure that product performance meets the demands of all intended uses for our products in all geographic areas.

Upgraded Systems
One of our key initiatives in 2013 is implementation of a system upgrade across North America. This upgrade comes after a thorough review of our business to assess our current information systems. We anticipate that the upgrade will provide benefits in terms of reporting and data analysis, in addition to replacing our aging systems.
Innovation
Although our dedicated Research and Development Center was shuttered during the downturn, LP has continued to be a market innovator with products such as LP FlameBlock® fire-rated OSB sheathing, the outdoor building solutions for Siding and industrial OSB panels. As we move forward, look for greater innovation as LP continues to lead the way with new products and smarter ways to do business.
Superior Sales and Service
LP set volume sales records for a number of products in 2012, when housing starts were at about one-half of the historical average. That is a testament to our sales force and marketing staff. In the downturn, we shifted to an even more customer-focused approach. As a result, we better understand our customers’ needs. That knowledge allows us to provide a meaningful customer experience and have better internal alignment and collaboration.
Harvest the Wins
In the lean times, we invested in marketing and sales to capture new customers. As evidenced by our performance in 2012, we were successful. We not only want to keep these new customers, we want to expand with them.
In Conclusion
None of these accomplishments would have been possible, nor will the success of our initiatives for 2013 be realized, without the full commitment and dedication of every LP employee. During these years of the most difficult environment our industry has ever seen, the energy, persistence, and yes, even optimism of the LP employees were inspiring to experience. In an improving market, we are confident that we have the tools we need to continue our success. 2012 set the stage for what we believe will be even better years ahead.
Thank you for your continued support,
E. Gary Cook Chairman
