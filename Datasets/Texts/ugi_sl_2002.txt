 To Our Shareholders:
I am very proud of what we achieved at UGI during Fiscal Year 2002. I am also delighted to report that our achievements were once again recognized in the market: our total return to shareholders for the one-year period ended November 30, 2002 was 31.3%, compared to a negative 30.9% return posted by Standard & Poor’s Utility Index. This marks the third consecutive year in which our total annual return exceeded 20%.
Our employees have an unmistakable and richly deserved sense of pride in having their efforts so recognized. The “thrill of victory” is a heady experience. It is precisely this kind of feeling that can transform the momentum gained from a track record of success into a tradition of success. Yet, this same “heady experience” can be a curse that breeds complacency. We are conscious of this risk. We are, therefore, redoubling our efforts and reintensifying our drive to create value for you over the long term.
It is, of course, no accident that your ownership in UGI has been richly rewarded these past several years. We have long believed that delivering superior results will inevitably lead to growth in shareholder wealth. We have thus sought to differentiate ourselves from others by creating a track record of success founded on meeting our financial commitments to you, which remain to:
• Grow earnings per share between 6 to 10% per year;
• Increase dividends per share 3% annually; and
• Reduce our dividend payout ratio over time to between 50% and 75%.
Since 1998, our earnings per share have grown at a compound annual rate of nearly 22%, the dividend on a share of UGI Common Stock has increased from $1.46 to $1.65 or more than 3% annually, and our dividend payout ratio has fallen from 120% to 61%. As we embarked on this journey, we promised to focus our efforts on managing what is controllable and to have the wisdom to accept what is not. We kept our word and our business is stronger than ever.
Fiscal Year 2002 was a good year for UGI in more ways than just providing superior total return to shareholders. Despite winter weather that was significantly warmer than normal, your Company accomplished the following:
• Our earnings grew by 34% to $75.5 million, and earnings per share increased by 31% to $2.70 from $2.06 the prior year;
• We ended the year with $114 million of cash available for long-term investment;
• We invested $35.9 million in our core utility business, grew our gas utility residential heating customer base by over 4% and improved earnings in our electric business;
• We successfully integrated Columbia Energy’s propane business into AmeriGas and experienced notable improvement in AmeriGas’ overall customer focus efforts and in its PPX® grill cylinder exchange business;
• Our international propane businesses contributed 27 cents in earnings per share compared to a loss of 16 cents last year;
• Our GASMARK® and HVAC energy services businesses continued to grow and show significant improvements in earnings.

 In many ways, our success in 2002 was attributable to our commitment to our strategy and our focus on execution. Also contributing to our progress was our ability to capital- ize on opportunities arising from the changing complexion of the energy industry over the last few years.
We have assembled a group of energy products and services businesses, with each busi- ness independent enough to stand on its own while at the same time enhancing the strength of the others. With clear strategic choices, operational excellence and financial discipline, we have returned to the reliable earnings and cash flow growth that share- holders expect from a balanced growth and income investment vehicle. Now that our financial foundation is strong and we have gained some momentum, what comes next?
We enter Fiscal Year 2003 excited and optimistic about our future. Like all companies, we have challenges ahead, but we also have the team in place to take advantage of our opportunities. I have long believed that in great companies, people do more than accept change...they embrace it. We are committed to ensuring that we squarely face the changing realities of the energy marketplace and make whatever refinements to our direction that are necessary.
We will be on the lookout for opportunities to grow further. While growth sometimes comes in dramatic fashion like the acquisition of Columbia Propane, it also often occurs in smaller steps through careful design and implementation. Our efforts will be directed towards pursuing those growth opportunities that permit us to capitalize on our existing network of assets and intellectual capital. The year ahead will also be one of continued focus, refinement and execution.
Last year I stated that common sense precluded me from promising you annual total returns like the 40% we delivered in Fiscal Year 2001. While we once again delivered outstanding total returns to you during Fiscal Year 2002, we cannot control how the market views our securities at any given time. There are times when the market is favorably disposed toward value-oriented growth and income investments, and times when it is not. We cannot manage to what is in fashion. Instead, we will keep our attention directed toward seizing the opportunities before us, while we maintain our focus on execution. We remain convinced that over the long term the market will reward companies that distinguish themselves through performance.
I would like to express my gratitude to our Board of Directors for the excellent leader- ship they have provided. We are fortunate to have a Board comprised of individuals with diverse backgrounds and skills and who are willing to provide their insights on the wide variety of issues we face in setting the direction of the Company. I also want to recognize in particular the many employees of UGI whose daily efforts permit us to deliver on
our promises. Each of you deserves a hearty “thanks” for your commitment to winning. We have a promising future and our greatest achievements are yet to come.
I look forward to reporting our continuing progress to you in the future.
