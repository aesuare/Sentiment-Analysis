want to begin by thanking our employees and unitholders for being part of one of the great success stories in the petroleum products business. We have been in business and successful for 127 years and have paid quarterly distributions the entire 27 years we have been a publicly traded master limited partnership.

in Buckeye's long history, and I am happy to report they were completed safely, on-time, and on-budget. In addition, we have seen exciting new opportunities for transporting and storing crude oil both domestically, with the resurging domestic crude oil production, and internationally, where BORCO is emerging as a critical staging location for new crude oil production off the coast of South America.

These accomplishments are important milestones as Buckeye's nearly 1,300 employees pursue our vision of being the logistical solutions partner of choice for the global energy business.

Commitment to Safety I am pleased to report that Buckeye was able to achieve record financial results in 2012 while maintaining safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible operations. Buckeye's commitment to best-in-class operations is demonstrated by the fact that we continued to improve our performance in key safety areas of injuries and motor vehicle incidents, where we achieved 23 percent and 36 percent year-on-year reductions, respectively, in incident rates for these key performance areas in 2012. Our safety performance continues to outperform industry benchmarks. Safety is a core value and remains the highest priority at Buckeye, and these excellent statistics demonstrate how our employees remain focused even as we integrate significant acquisitions and undertake substantial capital projects. Financial Performance Buckeye achieved record Adjusted EBITDA1 for 2012 of $559.5 million, an increase of 15 percent compared to $487.9 million for 2011. This record performance was the result of the increased contribution from our BORCO facility, including the

contribution from recently completed storage expansion projects, the full year contribution from the 2011 acquisition of a significant portfolio of terminals and pipelines from BP North America, and the partial year contribution from the Perth Amboy terminal acquisition.

Cash

We continued our uninterrupted history of payment of cash distributions in each quarter since becoming a publicly traded partnership in 1986. Distributions paid in 2012 totaled $4.15 per unit, an increase of 12.5 cents per unit, or over three percent, over 2011 cash distributions. As one of the first publicly traded master limited partnerships, Buckeye has the longest track record of consecutive quarterly distributions among our MLP peers. Growth and Diversification Perth Amboy Acquisition In July 2012, we completed the acquisition of a terminal storage facility with over four million barrels of storage located on the New York Harbor. This terminal improves connectivity and service capabilities and provides security and diversity of product supply for our customers by connecting

waterborne product supply with end destination markets across our system. We believe the improved connectivity and service capabilities will increase utilization of our pipeline and terminal system. The facility, located in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, boasts three active docks, including one ship dock with up to 37 feet of draft. Our plans to transform this facility include a direct pipeline link to our Linden complex, which is a key origination point for our Northeast pipeline system. Other significant growth capital projects are planned at the facility to transform it into a highly efficient, multi-product storage, blending, and throughput facility.

Repurposing of Assets Buckeye transported approximately 1.4 million barrels per day of petroleum products in 2012 through our approximately 6,000 miles of pipeline. Our approximately 100 liquid petroleum products terminals handled almost 900,000 barrels per day of products in 2012. Products handled by Buckeye include gasoline; distillates, including diesel fuel, heating oil, and kerosene; jet fuel; and crude oil, for which we have recently seen a resurgence in volumes. Buckeye began operations back in 1886 with a Standard Oil crude oil pipeline from the western Pennsylvania oilfields to Cleveland, Ohio refineries. We are now seeing a return of crude oil to the slate of products Buckeye transports and stores. We are currently offloading railcars with crude oil sourced from the Bakken region at our Woodhaven, Michigan terminal facility. The crude oil is then shipped via pipeline to an Ohio refinery for our customer. We also initiated crude oil activities at our Albany, New York terminal in 2012. Our Albany facility now has the

ability to handle unit-train-sized crude oil shipments again sourced from the Bakken region. We offload the crude oil from railcars, store the product at our terminal, and then load the crude oil across our marine dock onto ships or barges for transport to our customer's Saint John, Canada refinery. Both of these success stories are the result of our commercial teams identifying profitable new uses for underperforming assets with minimal additional capital investment.

Perth Amboy terminal is an important part of the value equation and we believe it will provide our Perth Amboy terminal with a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We are looking at ways to leverage other domestic Buckeye assets as well, particularly around the Midwest. As production from shale formations, such as from the Bakken and Utica regions, continues to change the domestic crude supply landscape, Buckeye intends to leverage its assets and people to provide crude oil logistic solutions for producers and refiners wherever possible.

Crude oil is also expected to play an important part in the success of the Perth Amboy terminal transformation, as we expect to be able to offload at least one unit train of product, or approximately 70,000 barrels, per day, with the possibility of expanding that capability to in excess of 100,000 barrels per day. Crude oil customers at our Perth Amboy terminals are expected to then have the ability to ship that product out across our marine dock to waiting ships or barges, or via pipeline or truck to any number of final destinations. The optionality expected to be provided by the

International Markets Growth Buckeye began its move into the international markets with the BORCO and Yabucoa marine terminal acquisitions. With respect to BORCO, crude oil storage has always been a significant aspect of this business, comprising just over a fifth of leased capacity at the facility for 2012. We expect that percentage will increase as we believe crude oil storage and services to be a significant growth opportunity in

In 2012, we announced the execution of an important longterm agreement with a customer for significant crude oil storage at BORCO. This agreement supports the construction of additional expansion capacity as well as making use of substantial existing tankage. BORCO is expected to act as a staging and blending hub for this customer, which has new

Results for the year also benefited from higher pipeline tariff rates and terminalling contract rate escalations, although tariff increases were limited to operating systems other than Buckeye Pipe Line Company, L.P. as a result of a 2012 FERC Order. This order now has been substantially resolved, allowing for tariff increases in 2013 on all of our pipelines. Our tariffs for transportation of jet fuel from New Jersey to three New York City area airports remain subject to an ongoing complaint, which is currently the subject of formal settlement efforts at FERC.

are expected to be a significant driver of increased cash flows for 2013, as we expect to add to our butane blending capabilities at additional terminals across our system. In addition, a propylene rail and storage facility completed in late 2012 and the transformation of our Perth Amboy terminal are expected to provide incremental contribution to earnings in late 2013.

prior year. 2012 results were impacted by backwardated market conditions and sustained basis weakness driven by changing supply fundamentals in the Northeast and Midwest markets. We saw improvement in this segment in late 2012 that we expect to continue in 2013 as we reduced operating costs and executed our risk mitigation strategy, which included focusing on fewer, more strategic locations with less expected basis volatility. Development & Logistics  Our Development & Logistics segment continues to show improved performance and earned $11.7 million of Adjusted EBITDA for 2012, compared to $7.9 million in 2011, from the contract operation of third-party pipelines and propane storage revenues from recent acquisitions.

Adjusted EBITDA in 2013 from an additional 2.8 million barrels of expansion storage capacity expected to become operational in 20133.

A pproximately 1.6 million barrels of expansion  storage was operational in the first quarter of 2013.

Our top priorities for 2013 include continuing to deliver on our expansion and enhancement projects at BORCO and our transformation project at our new Perth Amboy facility. We also expect to pursue additional growth opportunities that deliver value to our unitholders and complement our existing asset portfolio. As always, the safe and reliable operation of our assets remains the highest priority of our employees every day. Thank you for your investment and confidence in Buckeye. We look forward to updating you on the execution of our strategy throughout 2013.
