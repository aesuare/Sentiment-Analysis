A Letter to Our Shareholders

In our 2007 annual report, I wrote to you that our cash and grow strategy was "on schedule and...contributing to improved performance in the short term, even as it is strengthening our prospects for the long term." One year later, the same holds true.

Joseph G. Morone President & *OPLM,_LJ\[P]L6MÄJLY

We expect to complete our three-year restructuring on schedule, by the end of 2009; our short-term performance was indeed stronger in 2008 because of that restructuring effort, with earnings per share before special items at $2.39, compared to $1.88 in 2007; and as I have described in our most recent quarterly earnings releases, we continue to be optimistic about the prospects of our cash and grow portfolio beyond 2009, and of our ability to generate strong HUKNYV^PUNJHZOÅV^Z^LSSPU[V[OLM\[\YL But what a difference a year makes! As I write this letter in early March 2009, with the economy in the deepest recession since the Great Depression and the stock market reeling, our 2008 performance seems almost irrelevant. What matters is the global recession, how we are responding to it, and what our expectations are about our performance in the face of it . . . for 2009 and beyond. If the trends we were seeing at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 persist, sales during the recession could be down as much as 15% compared to 2008 levels. The obvious response to such a deep and sudden decline in sales, for us and any other company, is to cut costs. Our approach has been to emphasize cost reductions that are permanent and structural in nature.

As I explained in February in our Q4 2008 earnings release, once the increasing severity of the recession became clear [V\ZSH[LPU^LILNHU[VHJJLSLYH[L[OLÄUHSZ[LWZPU our three-year global restructuring process, and simultaneously, to initiate additional cost-reduction measures that, under ordinary circumstances, we would have pursued more gradually over several years. At the same time, we also began to put much more emphasis on cash: freeing up working capital, reducing our exposure to high-credit-risk customers, and wherever we could do so without an impact on our competitiveness, delaying or cancelling capital expenditures. The initial impact of these efforts was already apparent in Q4, as cash from operations improved from $42 million in Q4 2007 to $52 million in Q4 2008, our leverage ratio declined from 2.62 in Q3 2008 to 2.54 in Q4, and our planned capital expenditures for 2009 declined to $50 million from peak levels of $149 million in 2007 and $130 million in 2008. As a result of these actions, and assuming that the sales patterns of late 2008 and early 2009 persist through the year, we expect:  For 2009, high restructuring costs and progressively improving margins;

 For 2010, even if the 15% downtrend in sales continues through the year,  higher margins,  sharply lower restructuring charges,  capital expenditures at or below depreciation, and  lower levels of working capital. So even if the recession persists, we should leave  HZHM\UKHTLU[HSS`TVYLWYVÄ[HISLJVTWHU`^P[O the three-year restructuring effort behind us, and with a WYVZWLJ[VMZ[YVUNHUKZ\Z[HPULKJHZOÅV^HOLHKVM\Z And yes, for those of you who study our quarterly releases, we expect to be reporting simpler releases with fewer charges for restructuring and performance improvement.

These will play a critical role in our global PMC business as we eliminate exports from Europe to Asia, supply products to emerging markets outside of Asia that had been served by our European plants, and of course, once Asian economies begin to grow again, meet the growing demand locally.

And as the year progressed, and restructuring, process improvement, and shared services started to take hold, gross margins improved even while revenue declined, and selling, technical, general, and research expenses declined.

healthy cash flows in 2010 and beyond."
 The 24% growth in sales in 2008 compared to 2007 was fueled in large measure by new product introductions, particularly in the machine protection market, as well as the full-year effect of the July 2007 R-Bac acquisition. Late in 2008, we completed the acquisition of Aktor GmbH, a producer of low-cost high-performance doors for the food market. While we expect overall product sales to be down sharply in 2009 because of the recession, we do expect sales from our Aktor line to grow rapidly through the recession.  We continued to expand our aftermarket presence, with aftermarket sales growing 19% in 2008 compared to 2007. Aftermarket sales should continue to grow during the recession, and will help to offset the likely decline in product sales.

And results for 2009 are also likely to be soft, because of the impact of the recession on several of our other customers, who have ramped down production of their engines and aircraft. But underlying the weak sales picture is a strengthening prospect of new business development and of the long-term annuitylike streams of revenue associated with such development. Both 2008 and early 2009 were marked by the expansion of our portfolio of development projects. We are now working on or exploring a broader array of engine parts for a broader array of new engines, a growing number of applications for a growing number of new airframes, HUKHZTHSSI\[ZPNUPÄJHU[U\TILYVMUL^WYVQLJ[ZPU the defense sector.

In sum, while there is a good story to be told about Albany's 2008 performance, by the time I wrote this letter in March of 2009, all of us were far more focused on what lay ahead for Albany in this time of severe economic uncertainty than on what we accomplished in 2008. And yet, it is precisely because of those accomplishments that we HYLJVUÄKLU[[OH[L]LUPM[OLYLJLZZPVUL_[LUKZ^LSSIL`VUK [OPZ`LHY^L^PSSLUK HZHM\UKHTLU[HSS`TVYLWYVÄ[able company, in stronger competitive positions in each of our markets, and with the capacity to generate healthy JHZOÅV^ZPUHUKIL`VUK Finally, I would like to close this letter with a word about the people that I work with here at Albany International. As it has been for so many companies, the past several months have been brutally painful, for both investors and employees (many of whom are also investors). All of that pain is measured in human terms, from the loss of wealth by all of us who are shareholders, to the loss of jobs by so many

of our former colleagues. Nearly 1,000 of our people around the world, many of them longtime employees, will have left the company as a consequence of our three-year restructuring effort. And so even though we SVVR[VV\YM\[\YL^P[OHZLUZLVMJVUÄKLUJLHUKNYV^PUN momentum, we do so with mixed emotions, and with an acute sense of loss for the colleagues who have had to leave the company, and gratitude for their many contributions to Albany International and its shareholders.

Sincerely,

The Company discloses certain income and expense items on a per share basis. "Earnings before special items" refers to net income or loss as reported in the Statement of Operations, adjusted to reverse the effects of restructuring and other performance-improvement costs, the goodwill impairment charge, and discrete tax adjustments. The Company believes that such disclosures provide

important insight into underlying earnings. The Company calculates the per share amount for items included in continuing operations by using the tax rate at the end of the applicable reporting period (before the effect of any discrete items) and the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period.
