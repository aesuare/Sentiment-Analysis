RALPH LAUREN
Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer

DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
This year was another strong year for Polo Ralph Lauren and I am proud of our significant accomplishments. We ended the year stronger than ever, having made remarkable progress on our long-term strategies, while delivering growth and increasing our overall financial strength. Our success comes from our commitment to our vision and excellence in all that we do -- from design integrity, to marketing, to presentation, to customer experience, to product quality. Even in the past year's challenging environment, we continued to invest in our brand, invest in our advertising and strengthen our business infrastructure to support our long-term growth. A milestone for our Company was the continued success of our retail group. It is an unparalleled combination of design, marketing and merchandising that creates the unique shopping experience to which our customers responded. With sales in our stores outperforming the industry, we continue to see phenomenal response to our luxury designs. We also made significant improvements in our retail profits and I believe we have the retail leadership to continue to drive that progress. We have developed a strong real estate and store development plan from which we will open approximately 70 to 85 Ralph Lauren stores over the next five years in the United States and Europe. One of our major accomplishments this year was assuming operating responsibility for the Lauren by Ralph Lauren brand. We've quickly built it into an even stronger brand that decidedly reflects the Polo Ralph Lauren sensibility. The design aesthetic is classic and the execution has been flawless. This was an extraordinary accomplishment. I congratulate everyone on our remarkably talented team who has been involved in building a business that we project to generate $400 million in revenues in its first full year under our direct control. Throughout the year and across the Company we continued to execute our multi-year initiatives, taking consistent steps toward our vision of the future. We consolidated our European operations, expanded our business throughout Asia and introduced our home designs to the professional interior designer community. With the acquisition of our childrenswear licensee, we are now adding another important business that we believe we can continue to expand. Since launching Polo for boys 25 years ago, we've developed a substantial global business extending beyond boys to include newborns, infants, toddlers and girls. We successfully completed a secondary offering for Goldman Sachs of their total holdings, approximately 10.6 million shares. While the Company did not receive funds from this offering, it did present an opportunity for us to market our story to new and potential shareholders. We welcome more than 75 new institutional investors to our shareholder base as a result of this offering. In addition to the offering, we initiated a quarterly cash dividend this year.

We continue to strengthen our management team to help direct our global operations. The leadership of Polo Ralph Lauren is stronger than ever. This year we added senior management strength in key areas, including manufacturing, store management, retail development and international operations. Our business is a success because of the passion and talent of all our employees, across all levels of the organization. I am particularly proud of our ability to attract and retain the best people in the industry. It gives this Company a valuable mix of deep experience and fresh energy -- as well as a common desire to constantly improve. As many of you know, one of our core values is our belief in giving back to the communities where we work, live and do business. Over the years, we have led a variety of programs for cancer care and prevention, ranging from Fashion Targets Breast Cancer to our global Pink Pony Campaign. Recently, we've taken a leadership role in the fight against cancer in underserved communities by providing access to high quality medical care in those areas. In May 2003, the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention opened its doors in Harlem. The Center, the result of a partnership with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and North General Hospital, provides state-of-the-art prevention, detection and treatment programs. We are proud that it is regarded as a valuable resource for the community as well as a model for other communities. Over the past few years we have welcomed several new members to our Board of Directors, increasing the number of independent directors and expanding the collective experience and expertise of the Board. This year Myron E. (Mike) Ullman, III joined our board. Mike is retired Directeur General, Group Managing Director of LVMH. His extensive experience in the international luxury business will benefit Polo Ralph Lauren greatly as we continue to expand our brand globally. At the same time, as Vice Chairman Lance Isham retires, I want to thank him for the innumerable contributions he made to the Company in his 22-year career with us, most recently leading the consolidation and integration of our European business. Looking ahead, I see a world of opportunity for Polo Ralph Lauren. More important, I see a company that consistently demonstrates its ability to see and seize opportunity, to create and maintain excellence. Polo Ralph Lauren's strength and power are due in no small measure to the support of our Board of Directors, our management, all our employees, our business partners, our shareholders and most importantly, our customers. I thank you all. And, I am excited about all we will accomplish in the year ahead.
