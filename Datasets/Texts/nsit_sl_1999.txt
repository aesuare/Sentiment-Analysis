We are thrilled to report yet another terrific year at Insight. Strong sales growth, outstanding earnings, the expansion and further development of our domestic and international businesses as well as the receipt of several prestigious awards including debuting on Fortune Magazine’s Fortune 1000 List,highlighted an incredi- ble 1999.
We continue to generate strong sales and earnings growth, as confirmed at year-end with Insight's reporting of its eighteenth consecutive quarter of sequential sales and earnings growth. Net sales for the year increased to over $1.5 billion from $1.0 billion in 1998, a 51% increase year-over-year, while net earnings grew even faster year-over-year to $33.6 million from $20.0 million - a 64% increase. Both sides of our business contributed to our tremendous success in 1999: Insight Direct Worldwide's ability to increase top-line sales while capitalizing on economies of scale, and the continued successful growth of Direct Alliance Corporation.
Our business model at Insight Direct Worldwide remains constant. We continue to believe that our direct model, which focuses heav- ily on proactive outbound relationship-based selling to small- to medium-sized businesses coupled with the use of electronic cus- tomer and supplier interfaces, is the most efficient and successful approach to selling IT products in our market. At year-end Insight Direct Worldwide employed 1,273 account executives, up from 954 at December 31, 1998 - a 33% increase. We are confident that both our U. S. and international direct sales operations can support strong account executive growth in the future.
1999 marked a period of further development of our European operations, which represented 10.3% of sales in 1999 compared to 5.5% in 1998. Our Insight United Kingdom operations continue to develop profitably but were hindered somewhat due to our ulti- mately unsuccessful attempt to acquire a large United Kingdom- based computer direct marketer. This merger attempt resulted in a one-time $1.4 million charge, net of taxes, to earnings in 1999 for the effect of aborted acquisition costs. We remain optimistic
about the future of the Insight Germany operations that we acquired in December 1998. We have seen encouraging progress in the sales and infrastructure areas and we believe our opportu- nities in the German market are great, although to date we con- tinue to operate at a loss in Germany. We believe more than ever that global companies ultimately win the competitive battle.
Direct Alliance Corporation ("DAC") aggressively pursued its mis- sion to become a leading global outsourcing provider of web mar- keting, sales and transactional management services for tradi- tional and e-commerce companies through the addition of sever- al major programs during 1999. While DAC's percentage of Insight's consolidated sales is down from 9.2% in 1998 to 6.8% in 1999, this decrease is the result of its planned transition from rev- enue- to service-based programs. DAC's operations overall grew very strongly during the year, as can demonstrated by the fact that at year-end DAC employed 265 account executives, up from 118 at December 31, 1998 - a 125% increase.
Plusnet Technologies Ltd, our United Kingdom-based internet service provider ("ISP"), continued its mission to become the U.K.'s leading business-based ISP. Remarkably, unlike other ISP's, to date Plusnet has managed to accomplish its tremendous success profitably. Because this business differs from Insight's core business, we run it completely independently from our other U.K. operations.
During 1999, Insight received several prestigious awards, per- haps most notably being ranked ninth on Information Week's first e-business listing. Insight's strong electronic commerce focus (www.insight.com) resulted in another record year of unassisted web sales. Unassisted web sales (those sales completed without the assistance of an Insight account executive) represented 9.1% of net sales in 1999, up from 5.2% in 1998 - a 159% increase in unassisted websales. Also during 1999, Insight was ranked 49th on Fortune Magazine's list of the "100 Fastest Growing Companies in America" and Insight debuted on Forbes "Platinum 400 Ranking". In fact, Insight was one of only two companies on
the Forbes listing with average net earnings growth over 75%, average sales growth over 45% and average return on capital over 25% for the five-year measurement period. We are very proud of our consistently outstanding performance, especially in light of recent trends toward e-commerce companies that can't seem to make a profit.
Overall, 1999 was an exciting year. What made the difference, though, remains our employees! Since all of our employees are shareholders, we all share the vision and drive to make Insight a success. As always, we thank our employees, shareholders and alliance partners.
