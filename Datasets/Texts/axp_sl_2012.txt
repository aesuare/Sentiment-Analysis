AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY
TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
An uphill climb doesn’t mean you can’t go far.
Against the backdrop of a slow-growth environment, American Express delivered a strong total shareholder return in 2012 by controlling expenses, improving credit quality and generating higher revenues in all of our major business segments.
We grew purchase volume on our network much faster than the pace of the economy. We added new customers beyond our traditional base. And we looked ahead by retooling and restructuring the company for continued success as a leader in digital commerce.

AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY
 Our progress took us beyond some notable milestones:
• Reaching a record $888 billion in cardmember purchases by providing more value, convenience and benefits for in-store, online and mobile spending
• Passing the 100 million mark for cards-in-force as we expanded our core franchise
• Adding about 2.5 million new customers in our Enterprise Growth Group in 2012, one way that we’re broadening our reach through alternative products
• Achieving a new low in write-offs for bad loans as credit quality stayed at or near best-ever levels
• Winning our sixth straight J.D. Power and Associates award for highest customer satisfaction among U.S. credit card companies
Despite success on many fronts, the past year was not an easy one. We faced some tough challenges–in particular, the relatively weak economy and intense competition. We also had bad news of our own making when U.S. financial regulators found that some of our card practices didn’t comply with consumer laws. This was not our proudest moment, especially in light of the long-standing tradition of customer care that underpins our brand promise. I’ll have more to say about this event and our commitment to compliance later in this letter.
In addition, certain benefits that contributed to our earnings in 2011 diminished in 2012. Settlement payments from Visa and MasterCard lawsuits ended, and releases from credit loss reserves that we had established during the economic downturn were substantially lower. These factors made achieving year-over- year growth a tougher task.
What’s most important is how we responded to these challenges–with a commitment to raise our game.

2012 FINANCIAL RESULTS
For the year, we posted net income of $4.5 billion on strong growth in cardmember spending, excellent credit quality and careful expense management. Diluted earnings per share came in at $3.89, which was 6 percent below the prior year. Our 2012 results were tempered by three items in the fourth quarter: a $400 million restructuring charge, a $342 million expense reflecting higher estimates for Membership Rewards redemption rates, and a $153 million charge for cardmember reimbursements. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS from continuing operations would have been $4.40, compared with reported EPS of $4.09 a year ago.*
A deeper look reveals a number of themes that illustrate the strength and flexibility of our business model.
Top-line growth: We continue to benefit from the investments we’ve made over the last several years in products, services and capabilities to drive growth. As a result, total revenues rose 5 percent to $31.6 billion. That’s below our long- term target, but it came at a time when a number of major banks saw revenues in their card-issuing businesses decline. This was due, in our view, to the advantages of our spend-centric business model compared to their lend-centric models.
Robust cardmember spending: Coming on top of double-digit increases a year ago, we were pleased with the 8 percent rise in spending by our cardmembers. By outgrowing most of our major competitors, we continued to gain share of general purpose spending in the U.S. Most regions around the world saw strong volume growth as well, except in Europe, where fiscal problems kept spending flat to modestly higher.
High-quality lending: Although lending is not our primary source of revenue, it is an important contributor. While many of our major competitors experienced declines in their loan base, we grew total loans by 4 percent to $65.2 billion. This growth did not come at the expense of credit quality. No other major card issuer had write-off and past-due rates lower than ours, which speaks to the quality of our cardmembers and improvements in our risk management capabilities.
* Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure, is calculated by excluding from diluted earnings per share the Q4’12 restructuring charges ($0.25 per share), Membership Rewards expense ($0.19 per share) and cardmember reimbursements ($0.07 per share).

Well-controlled expenses: We are committed to controlling expenses while also making healthy investments in our future. Going into 2012, we sought to grow operating expenses at a slower rate than revenues. After meeting that goal, we now have a more ambitious one. For the next two years, we aim to hold annual operating expense increases to less than 3 percent. The flexibility we gain from a well-controlled opex base would help us meet a related objective: to maintain marketing and promotion investments at about 9 percent of revenues.
MARKETPLACE MOVES
During 2012, we made many moves to better serve our customers and drive commerce, including:
• Premium card launches and upgrades that earned more business from high- spending cardmembers
• Programs designed to help merchants build their businesses, such as the third annual Small Business Saturday, and enhanced fraud prevention and merchant financing services

This all adds up to good progress in 2012. We grew customer volumes at a solid pace; invested in a range of promising opportunities; advanced our evolution as a digital services company; and absorbed restructuring costs now that will better position us for our next era of growth.

The market has reacted favorably. American Express shares delivered a total return of 23.6 percent for the year, outperforming the Dow (up 7.3 percent) and the S&P 500 (up 16.0 percent), but coming in below the S&P Financials (up 28.9 percent). In March, we announced a dividend increase of 11 percent, as well as authorization from our Board to repurchase up to 150 million common shares.
Looking ahead, we want to accelerate our momentum and take advantage of the substantial growth opportunities in front of us. I believe our options for growth have expanded over the past five years, and I’m confident we will continue to capitalize on them. Here are some of the reasons why:
FOUNDATIONAL CHANGES
It all starts with a strong foundation for growth, one that we’ve improved greatly in recent years. The financial crisis affected companies in different ways. Some failed. Some waited for better times. Others took deliberate actions to adapt, invest and reshape strategies. Those are the companies that came out of the crisis stronger than they went in. I count American Express among them. Today, we have an exceptionally strong capital position, a lower risk profile, a more reliable funding base, greater liquidity and a more diversified billings base than we did five years ago. These changes make us better able to generate growth and deal with a volatile environment.
We have also become more nimble and adaptable. Upgraded technology platforms are increasing productivity and speed-to-market. Redesigned operations are making us more efficient and improving service quality. And we continue to offer better ways for our customers to interact with us through online and mobile channels.
The restructuring plan we recently announced is meant to build upon this progress. One piece of this plan involves reengineering our model in Global Business Travel as we continue the shift toward online channels and automated servicing tools. We’re also streamlining our staff groups across the company so we can concentrate more resources on high-growth areas, optimizing our client management and sales functions, and eliminating duplicate efforts.

We expect that these changes will result in a net reduction of 5,400 jobs. It’s never easy to make a decision that involves people losing their jobs. We will be parting with highly valued and respected colleagues who have made important contributions to our success. Yet, as difficult as this is on a personal level, we believe it’s the right thing to do for the business. In addition, making these changes while we are operating from a position of strength is the best time to do it.
Having a lean and flexible operating structure is a critical piece of our growth strategy. This restructuring program is part of that blueprint. It will reduce our expense base, increase our agility, and make us more efficient in using our resources to drive growth–even in a slow-growth economy. Ultimately, we believe it will help us continue to adapt and lead in a rapidly changing environment.
ADVANTAGES IN A DIGITAL ECONOMY
Our industry is being redefined by many forces, including the continued revolution in online and mobile technologies, which is transforming commerce and society. These factors are changing consumer preferences with an emphasis on greater personalization, immediacy and convenience. This is opening up new opportunities for growth that will play to our strengths. It also brings increased competition from traditional rivals and new entrants, all vying for the same customers.
We believe American Express has unique assets to succeed in an increasingly digital and mobile economy. As we’ve charted our digital transformation in recent years, we’ve followed a few principles: meet customers in the environment they prefer, connect with them in authentic ways, use our network to create valuable user experiences while building demand for merchants, and constantly refine our capabilities. We’re aiming not only to add value at the moment of purchase, but to do it at multiple points in the commerce chain.
One example is the way we used our digital assets and relationships to create Small Business Saturday, a national movement to support small businesses across America. In 2012, the third annual Small Business Saturday broke records. About 67 percent of American consumers were aware of Small Business Saturday, and they spent an estimated $5.5 billion at independent merchants on that day alone.

Then there’s how we are using our closed loop to connect cardmembers and merchants on the most powerful social and digital networks. Our Card Sync technology delivers relevant merchant offers to cardmembers who sync their cards to their Twitter, Facebook and Foursquare accounts. Offers are easy and seamless, no codes or coupons are needed, and savings come automatically via statement credits. Last March, we launched a new service for U.S. cardmembers that turns customized Twitter #hashtags into couponless national merchant offers. Enrolled cardmembers can sync, tweet and save.
We “get” the social Internet, e-payments and mobile commerce. As a result, we get a lot of online spending. Our online volumes rose 15 percent in 2012. This performance enabled us to remain the largest biller of online spending. Our closed-loop network is a powerful asset that is only becoming more valuable in the digital age. We continue to seek new ways to use it to drive commerce and create value for buyers and sellers.
Our digital capabilities have also broadened the types and numbers of customers we can profitably serve, whether through our core charge and credit products, or with next-generation stored-value and alternative products. We view assets such as our closed loop, our Serve digital commerce platform, and our rewards platforms as revenue generators that are opening up a range of new business opportunities.
SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY Two out of three American consumers were aware of Small Business Saturday this year, and they spent an estimated $5.5 billion at independent merchants that day.

A BROAD FOOTPRINT
While our core businesses remain vibrant, we certainly understand the need to keep expanding our revenue sources. We’re moving forward on a number of fronts as we develop new businesses and reach new customer segments.
One example, and it ties back to our expanding digital capabilities, is how we’re using our Serve platform to reach customers beyond the traditional profile of an American Express cardmember. We think this is a versatile tool for consumers in different age groups, those not enamored with the banking system, and those in emerging markets where a piece of plastic is not the first choice, or even a realistic option, to buy something.
Take Bluebird, one of our most exciting new products in 2012. Issued by American Express and available at Walmart stores and online, Bluebird is a next-generation alternative to debit and checking accounts. It combines prepaid with online, offline and mobile capabilities to help customers better manage and control their everyday finances. And, it’s bringing in those new customers we want. So far, 85 percent of Bluebird enrollees are new to American Express. Nearly half of them are under the age of 35.
We’re also expanding our footprint through Loyalty Partner, a business we acquired in 2011. Loyalty Partner runs coalition rewards programs that enable customers to save when they shop at participating merchants. This is a big business: 50 million enrollees, up 38 percent over the last year. Loyalty

Partner got its start in Germany, expanded to India where it’s growing rapidly, and launched in Mexico in 2012. It’s bringing engaged customers to American Express in key international markets.
Performance marketing is a promising opportunity for our company, and Loyalty Partner is one way we are expanding those services. Merchants pay fees to Loyalty Partner to improve the effectiveness of their marketing investments, acquire more customers and gain greater revenue from existing customers. In Germany, for example, Loyalty Partner used its targeted offer channel to put over 250 million merchant offers in front of consumers last year, achieving redemption rates far higher than traditional marketing channels.
Serve, Bluebird, Loyalty Partner and other early-stage ventures are helping us redefine the scope and relevance of our company.
CUSTOMER FOCUS
Going from the very new to the very old, our decades-long commitment to service is another advantage that serves us well today. As long as there has been an American Express, we’ve aspired to go above and beyond for customers by providing uncommon care.
Today, we’re widely recognized as a leader in customer satisfaction. Our sixth straight J.D. Power and Associates award, an honor that I mentioned earlier, is a terrific example. We’ve won many other awards for service and product excellence as well, from the United Kingdom to Mexico to India. Our good reputation spans continents.
We’re proud of our industry awards, but we pay even closer attention to what our customers tell us directly. Our “recommend to a friend” scores have improved by more than 30 percent over the last three years. We’ve also improved customer retention by about 40 percent over the last five years. This says a lot about the added value and high-quality service we provide to our customers.
It also made the news we received last October all the more difficult to experience.

After a lengthy review of our U.S. card practices, several regulators determined that American Express failed to follow consumer laws in a number of instances over the past few years. The issues involved several areas, including card solicitations, late fees for charge cards and debt collection practices. In general, they stemmed from what the regulators found were customer disclosures that could and should have been clearer, misinterpretation of new and evolving regulations, and certain process-oriented errors.
We worked closely with the regulators throughout their reviews. In fact, we brought some of the problems to their attention. We have taken responsibility for correcting the issues and strengthening controls to help prevent future mistakes. The review covered a period going back several years. Since that time, we’ve made significant investments to expand and enhance our compliance program. These efforts will surely continue.
As a result of October’s enforcement actions, we agreed to pay $27.5 million in fines and establish an $85 million fund for cardmember refunds. Our own ongoing analyses of cardmember inquiries, complaints and account records identified an additional $153 million in reimbursements for various types of transactions dating back several years, which we recognized in the fourth quarter.
Beyond the financial costs, our main concern is safeguarding the American Express brand and our relationships with customers. Compliance is more critical than ever, given the heightened scrutiny and expectations of regulators and the public. The bar has been raised for everyone in our industry, and fines against
COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMERS We received our sixth straight J.D. Power and Associates award for “Highest Customer Satisfaction Among Credit Card Companies.”

financial services companies have increased sharply. In this environment especially, we need to make sure that American Express continues to stand out for all the right reasons–extraordinary service, integrity, and fair and transparent treatment of customers.
As I’ve told our people, we have to make sure that our products and services work as intended, our communications are clear and accurate, marketing offers are fulfilled as stated, and that we see everything from the vantage point of our customers. In the end, we always have to ask ourselves, “Is this the way I would want to be treated?”
Much has been said about the increased regulatory burden for companies in our industry. We don’t view it as a burden. We view it as a responsibility. After all, regulators want what we want: to make sure customers understand our products and are treated well.
Putting our customers first is the right thing to do. It’s the reason we have the most satisfied cardmembers in the industry today. It’s also consistent with our brand heritage and business philosophy. Continuing this tradition as a customer- centric organization will help us grow.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
As we strive to do our best for our shareholders and customers, we are fortunate to be able to rely on the leadership and vision of our Board of Directors. It’s my pleasure to work with this distinguished group. Since my last letter to shareholders, we’ve had several changes to the Board that I want to note for you.
Daniel Akerson did not stand for re-election in 2012 in order to devote more time to his duties as chairman and CEO of General Motors, and Edward Miller and Jan Leschly will both reach mandatory retirement age in 2013. I want to thank Dan, Ed and Jan for their many years of service to American Express. These exceptional leaders have been truly committed to our company’s success and passionate advocates for our shareholders.
Meanwhile, we have made three outstanding additions to the Board. In 2012, we welcomed Dr. Daniel Vasella, former chairman and CEO of Novartis. Dan helped to make Novartis a worldwide leader and standard setter in the healthcare industry. We also elected two new directors in 2013 whose appointments will become effective on March 1: Anne Lauvergeon and Samuel Palmisano. Anne,

I’m proud to lead a company that reimagines what’s possible and adapts to change, yet stays true to the principles that made it successful in the first place.
It’s safe to say that the pace of change around us will only accelerate, and the degree of difficulty will only increase. We understand that and are prepared for the challenge.
There’s also tremendous opportunity ahead of us, measured in trillions of dollars of untapped commerce potential across consumer, small business and commercial payments. We are ready to capture a significant share of this spending as it migrates away from cash. We’re also intent on building out a broader range of services that create more value for merchants and cardmembers.
We have the business model, the brand and the entrepreneurial spirit to get it done.
