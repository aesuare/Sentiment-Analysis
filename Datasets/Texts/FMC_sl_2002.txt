TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
    William G. Walter, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer.
In our first year as the new FMC Corporation – a highly focused company with market leading businesses in Agricultural Products, Specialty Chemicals and Industrial Chemicals – we targeted our efforts on five key areas:
• Reducing costs and improving operating performance in each of our business segments;
• Repositioning selected businesses and product lines to compete more successfully in greater
value-added, higher-margin markets;
• Restructuring the supply chain within our Astaris phosphorus joint venture;
• Refinancing the company following the FMC Technologies spin-off; and
• Completing a detailed, strategic review of our portfolio and its ability to generate returns
that consistently exceed our cost of capital.
I am pleased that we made good progress in each of these areas. Despite a disappointing economic environment, we took aggressive steps to position FMC to generate higher returns for investors over the long term.
Operationally, across the company, we reduced selling, administrative, and R&D expenses by approximately $37 million. Our focus on working capital contributed funds in excess of $100 million, mainly from more efficient management of receivables and inventory. And, we implemented a more rigorous screen on capital spending, reducing it by $60 million versus 2001 by selectively limiting fixed-asset additions to those projects that should be able to achieve returns in excess of our cost of capital.
In Agricultural Products, we refocused our business on insecticides, ceased herbicide discovery, restructured overhead in North America and Europe, and developed strong global alliances to improve our market access in Europe and Japan. In our lithium business, we completed a strategic shift to higher growth, higher value specialty markets such as pharmaceutical synthesis, energy storage and polymer initiation. Astaris also restructured its supply chain, with further restructuring planned for 2003.

In very difficult financial markets, we successfully completed an equity offering on June 12, raising $101 million and – despite a ratings downgrade by one of the ratings agencies – completed a debt refinancing including $355 million in senior-secured notes and $540 million of new senior-secured credit facilities. The refinancing addressed all of our projected credit needs for the next five years and provides a significant amount of reserve credit capacity for future growth.
Finally, we completed a comprehensive assessment of the businesses in our portfolio. We will continually evaluate options for unlocking shareholder value in all of our businesses and focus on those opportunities with the greatest potential for future growth and attractive returns.
BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Although we are proud of the accomplishments of the past year, our overall financial results for 2002 were disappointing, reflecting the weak global economy, intense competition for some products and higher net interest expense.
Sales in 2002 were $1,852.9 million, down 5 percent from 2001. After-tax income from continuing operations and before special items was $2.55 per share on a diluted basis compared with $3.10 on the same basis last year.
Operating cash flow improved as a result of the various initiatives described above to $136.2 million in the year versus a negative $52.9 million in 2001. Business restructuring expenses, shutdown and remediation spending in Pocatello and continued funding support for our Astaris joint venture, which, in total, exceeded $90 million, offset strong free cash generation from our three business segments. Debt, net of cash, did not change versus 2001.
Agricultural Products performed well, especially given that the business started the year without the benefit of a $20 million DuPont profit protection payment received in 2001. During the year, the business made up nearly all that decline through a substantially streamlined cost structure, new product uses

 and applications, and, to a lesser extent, a more profitable sales mix. However, due to weakness in the Asian markets, revenues and earnings were down 6 percent and 5 percent, respectively.
Higher sales and earnings in Specialty Chemicals reflected stronger customer demand for microcrystalline cellulose and carrageenan in biopolymers and stronger sales to the pharmaceutical, polymer and battery markets in the lithium business. Revenues and earnings were both up 3 percent over 2001.
Our Industrial Chemicals businesses experienced weak end-use demand, excess production capacity in most major product lines and an unsustainable competitive environment in soda ash and phosphorus. As a result, segment sales declined 8 percent while earnings remained relatively flat largely due to successful cost reduction efforts.
OUTLOOK FOR 2003
While we are better positioned to weather difficult times than we were in 2002, we do not expect the overall economic and competitive environment to improve substantially in 2003. Agricultural Products and Specialty Chemicals should realize both sales and profit growth year-over-year. Some parts of Industrial Chemicals should see higher profit due to cost improvements, but pricing in many areas of Industrial Chemicals is expected to remain weak. This likelihood, combined with significantly higher interest expense due to our refinancing, should result in earnings below 2002 levels.
Against this backdrop, our four priorities for 2003 are to further position our businesses for an anticipated economic recovery, strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt, continue to build on our growth platforms, and pursue our portfolio restructuring.
We remain confident about the longer-term outlook for the company. The underlying strengths of the company’s businesses remain intact. The operating leverage, which will be realized in an economic recovery, is significant as is the earnings contribution from financial de-leveraging.

   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
In a time of national skepticism concerning the integrity of corporate America, I am pleased to report that our house is in order. The company has a long history of an involved and independent board of directors, a strong commitment to ethics, and generally conservative accounting practices. As a result, the changes we needed to make to be in compliance with the new SEC guidelines, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the New York Stock Exchange rules were minor and largely administrative in nature.
I am also pleased to welcome two new directors to our board – G. Peter D’Aloia, senior vice president and chief financial officer of American Standard Companies, Inc., and C. Scott Greer, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of Flowserve Corporation.
Finally, I would like to pay tribute to Albert J. Costello, an FMC board member, who passed away on September 3. Al joined FMC’s board of directors in 1995. He served as chairman of the compensation and organization committee, and was a member of the nominating and corporate governance committee. His wisdom and insight helped counsel FMC’s board and executives, particularly through our transition in 2001. He is sorely missed.
IN CONCLUSION
Thanks to the support we have received from our employees, customers and investors, we made good progress in a number of areas during our first year as the new FMC Corporation. I look forward to the future with confidence and great expectations.
