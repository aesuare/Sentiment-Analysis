Dear Fellow Shareholders:
Welcome to our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders. 2005 was a year with key accomplishments and many challenges for Wendy's International, Inc. We created tremendous value for our shareholders by implementing important elements of our strategic plan, including initiatives to improve Wendy's performance and to sell 15-18% of Tim Hortons in an initial public offering (IPO). Our stock price rose 41% during 2005 and reached an alltime high of $56.40 in December. Total revenues grew to a record $3.8 billion, and we reported pretax earnings of $338 million, or $1.92 diluted earnings per share (EPS). In this Letter to Shareholders, I will review our overall 2005 performance, discuss our strategic plan and outline the progress we've made on the execution of our initiatives. In addition, I will also discuss each of our brands ­ Wendy's, Tim Hortons, Baja Fresh, Cafe Express and Pasta Pomodoro ­ and their performance over the last year. Our Chief Financial Officer, Kerrii Anderson, will discuss in greater depth our 2005 results and the positive steps we are taking to increase shareholder value. Although it was a difficult year overall, we have taken decisive action to improve performance and position ourselves for growth in 2006. We remain committed to providing strong profits and returns for all of our shareholders and other stakeholders. 2005 Financial Results While we are pleased with many of our accomplishments during 2005, certain financial results were disappointing. Our Wendy's business reported negative same-store sales for the first time in 19 years: a 3.7% decline at Wendy's U.S. company restaurants compared to a 2.9% increase a year ago, and a 3.1% decline at Wendy's U.S. franchised restaurants compared to a 1.8% increase a year ago. Our Tim Hortons business posted strong results, producing 5.2% same-store sales growth in Canada and 7.0% growth in the U.S., even as the chain was rolling over year-ago gains of 7.4% and 9.8%, respectively. At Baja Fresh, same-store sales declined 3.7% compared to a 6.3% decline a year ago. The Company and its franchisees opened 417 new restaurants systemwide during the year: 211 Wendy's, 187 Tim Hortons and 19 Baja Fresh. Strategic Plan Enhances Shareholder Value Management and the Board of Directors are committed to creating value over the long term. We announced on July 29 a series of strategic initiatives to improve the performance of our Wendy's business and highlight the value of Tim Hortons. These initiatives are a continuation of our long-term approach to building our business and represent the culmination of several years of planning and ongoing analysis of our Company. The initiatives are:

We completed a thorough review of the Wendy's business and intend to maximize profits and returns in the U.S., Canada and International markets by taking decisive actions. These actions include rebalancing our companyoperated store mix, closing underperforming stores, selling franchised real estate and slowing store development.

We made significant progress on many of these initiatives in 2005, including:
s

During the fourth quarter of 2005, we closed more than

40 underperforming Wendy's restaurants.
s

As of year-end 2005, we sold 171 real estate properties

to franchisees and third parties.
s

We slowed Wendy's new store development in 2005

and will focus on building stores in the future that will meet or exceed our cost of capital.
s

We plan to rebalance the U.S. store mix over the next

one to three years by franchising company-owned Wendy's stores. We will also do the same in Canada. In her letter on page 8, CFO Kerrii Anderson will discuss the value-enhancing actions we have undertaken as a result of these initiatives. I am pleased to announce that we are on track with our timeline for the initiatives, and that we are effectively evolving our business and enhancing value for our shareholders. We are focused on executing each element of the plan in the most timely and most efficient manner possible to grow sales and profits at Wendy's and maintain the positive momentum at Tim Hortons. Now, let's take a closer look at our businesses and their performance during 2005:
Jack Schuessler Schuessler assumed the role of President of the Wendy's brand in 2005, in addition to the role as Chairman that he has held since May 2001. He became Chief Executive Officer and President in March 2000. Previously, he was President and Chief Operating Officer, Wendy's U.S. Operations (1997-2000) and Executive Vice President, U.S. Operations (1995-97). He started his career with Wendy's more than 30 years ago and has worked in operations at the local, regional and divisional levels. Kerrii B. Anderson Anderson joined the Company in 2000 as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. She was appointed to Wendy's Board of Directors in November 2000. Anderson previously held the position as CFO for 14 years at M/I Schottenstein Homes, Inc. in Columbus, Ohio. Anderson graduated from Elon College in North Carolina. She has an M.B.A. from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University. Anderson directs the Company's accounting and finance functions, as well as strategic planning, treasury, tax, risk management, internal audit, investor relations, supply chain management, Wendy's bakery and information technology.

Wendy's Brand Remains Strong Despite 2005 Challenges The Wendy's brand remains strong despite the challenges we experienced throughout the year. These challenges included hurricanes Katrina and Rita that hit the Southeast United States in August and September, which resulted in more than 7,000 lost operating days and almost $25 million in lost sales. We also faced all-time high beef costs, up approximately 12% from last year, and up

28% since 2003, which has severely impacted our profit margins. In addition, a consumer fraud incident in March 2005 hurt our sales, not only in the Western Region, but also throughout the entire U.S. for months afterward. Although 2005 was a difficult year, our business remains strong. Wendy's produced revenues of $2.4 billion in

3

2005, which is essentially even with last year. We have generated positive same-store sales in 18 out of the last 19 years. Our U.S. Wendy's restaurants continue to deliver average unit sales of more than $1.3 million, which ranks among the highest in the industry. We also have a new leadership team in place, as we made several organizational changes to strengthen and energize the brand over the course of the year. I took on the role of President of the Wendy's brand in September, in addition to my responsibilities as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. I started my career with Wendy's more than 30 years ago and have worked in operations at all levels in the system. In my new role with Wendy's, I am committed to improving all aspects of our performance.

consumers. We are expanding our advertising beyond the traditional media outlets of television, radio and print, to also include Internet campaigns. We launched several new products in 2005, including Fresh Fruit Bowls and Cups, Mediterranean Chicken Salad, Strawberry Yogurt with Granola and Fix 'n Mix FrostyTM with M&M's®, Butterfinger® and Oreo® cookie toppings. We also introduced our proprietary Combo Choices program, which offers consumers the option of substituting a small chili, baked potato, side salad or Caesar side salad in place of fries in a combo, at no extra charge. This program was extremely well received by our customers, evidenced by the fact that close to 15% of our combos are now sold with an alternative side. New "Combo Plan" To Position Wendy's For Growth

A new addition to the Wendy's leadership team in 2005 was Ian Rowden. As Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Ian oversees all of Wendy's brand marketing strategies and initiatives. In his first year at the Company, Ian has helped us successfully evolve our marketing strategy to a more targeted and more contemporary approach. Our research tells us the "Do What Tastes Right.TM" advertising campaign, which launched during the second quarter of 2005, is beginning to resonate with

Our goal is to continue to distinguish the Wendy's brand from the competition and be the best quick-service restaurant (QSR) in the industry. We are very optimistic about building Wendy's momentum in 2006. To accomplish this, we have recently introduced a new "3-Tiered, 3-Year Combo Plan" to drive sales, improve restaurant profit margins and reduce costs over the next three years. Wendy's management team is extremely confident about the

Increasing Same-Store Sales More Than 3% Annually
s

Through our new marketing strategy, we intend to drive same-store sales by more than 3% annually. To achieve this goal, we will differentiate ourselves from the competition by launching innovative products and developing more compelling advertising. To get products to market more quickly, we have more closely aligned our Research & Development and Marketing departments. Over the last year, we have spent a significant amount of time researching, developing and testing new products, and our pipeline is full. We have an excellent new product line-up for the first half of 2006, including Frescata specialty deli sandwiches, two new Garden Sensations salads, a 10-Piece Chicken Nugget Combo, Wendy's Kids' Meal® deli sandwiches, and the Jr. BBQ Cheeseburger, which will be a part of our enhanced Super Value Menu. We also will be testing several new products in 2006, including a unique "Double Melt" cheeseburger. Available as a Jalapeno Cheddar Double Melt or a Cheddar Bacon Double Melt, the sandwiches contain two patties "stuffed" with a variety of cheeses, sauces, bacon, tomatoes, jalapenos and more. Other new products include a 99cent chicken sandwich, new beverages, a vanilla Frosty, Frescata line extensions, and combo meal sizing options. In addition, we are planning to test breakfast during the second half of the year and expect to introduce it systemwide in 2007. Our new "Do What Tastes Right." advertising campaign is much edgier and far more contemporary than our prior campaigns. Under the "Do What Tastes Right." umbrella, we are utilizing a "platform" strategy instead of our traditional "pillar" strategy, that is, running multiple, targeted product messages simultaneously to improve the reach and relevancy of our advertising. Through platform marketing, we intend to deliver the right message to the right consumer through the right media vehicle. Because we

Improving Operating Margins

By 500 Basis Points Over Three Years In addition to growing sales, we are also focused on improving restaurant-level margins by 500 total basis points over the next three years. A key component of this margindriving initiative is our new double-sided grill, which provides our restaurants with enhanced product quality, faster cooking times and labor savings. As of year-end 2005, the double-sided grill was in about 1,350 stores, and we plan to roll it out to the entire Wendy's system by the end of 2008. We are also implementing a store automation system to reduce administrative and labor costs, as well as supply chain management tactics to reduce food, paper and controllable costs. We are committed to "heightened execution" in our restaurant operations to not only meet, but exceed, consumer expectations. As our industry becomes increasingly competitive and our QSR peers continue to improve their operations, we also need to keep improving. According to the 2005 QSR Magazine Drive-Thru Time Study, Wendy's was rated No.1 in drive-thru speed for the seventh consecutive year, but our overall service time actually slowed compared to 2004. In 2006, we are determined to improve our operations at the drive-thru by focusing on accuracy and service without sacrificing speed.
s

Reducing Costs Throughout The Organization

Management has started to review processes throughout the organization, looking for efficiencies and identifying cost reductions. Our goal is to reduce expenses by $40 million to $60 million by the end of 2006. All of us at Wendy's are focused on improving performance to maximize profits. We plan to remain focused on our long-term approach to improve performance, and will not sacrifice our Service Excellence program to achieve unsustainable cost savings.

5

What we are doing is leveraging our system to lower supply costs and developing new products with healthy profit margins. We also have plans under way to responsibly reduce our expenses while continuing to provide the outstanding service and customer focus that our customers have come to expect from us. The Senior Management Team, along with the entire system of operators and franchisees, is focused on evolving the Wendy's brand and beginning an exciting new chapter for our Company.

The Tim Hortons U.S. business continues to evolve. In 2005, we repositioned the U.S. business for improvement by taking several actions, including recording a charge of approximately $25 million for the write-down of goodwill associated with our acquisition of 42 restaurants in New England in 2004. We also closed one restaurant and impaired others, resulting in a charge of about $19 million. Despite these challenges, we remain committed to both the New England market and the U.S. business. We plan to profitably develop our U.S. presence by further penetrating existing markets and entering adjacent markets. Our goal is to have 500 stores in the U.S. by the end of 2008.

Tim Hortons Again Delivers Strong Results In The U.S. And Canada President and Chief Executive Officer Paul House and his team led Tim Hortons to another outstanding year in 2005. As the largest QSR in Canada, Tim Hortons reached 28% of the overall QSR market share based on traffic, and 76% of the Coffee and Baked Goods category. Based on sales dollars, Tim Hortons is now almost 25% larger than its closest QSR competitor in Canada. Tim Hortons continued its strong performance in 2005, increasing revenues to an all-time high of $1.2 billion, up 19.0% compared to 2004. Total restaurants grew to 2,597 in Canada and 288 in the U.S. Tim Hortons Canadian standard restaurants produced $1.7 million (Canadian dollars) in average unit sales in 2005. Due to its consistently strong performance, Canadian Business magazine recently named Tim Hortons as Canada's "best-managed brand" and "most admired corporate culture." Because Tim Hortons is such a well-known force in the Canadian marketplace, we believe we still have significant potential for growth of the brand. Our goal is to leverage our competitive advantages for continued expansion, focusing on underdeveloped areas such as the Western provinces, Quebec and select high-traffic urban centers. Our long-term goal is to have between 3,500 and 4,000 system restaurants open in Canada.

Our sales growth reflects our unwavering emphasis on customer service and product innovation. In 2005, we introduced a wide range of new menu items, including our Hearty Vegetable Soup, Southwest Chicken Sandwich, Toasted Chicken Club, Yogurt and Berries, and Hot Smoothees. Our "Always Fresh" par-baking process enables us to serve fresh baked goods throughout the day, including our new lemon cranberry muffin and twelvegrain bagel. It also allows us to provide varied menu offerings with frequent new and promotional items, such as our "Donut of the Month."

Baja Fresh Making Improvements To Strengthen Business To position Baja Fresh for improvement, we took several actions in 2005 to strengthen the performance of the brand. We closed five underperforming restaurants during the year, resulting in a charge of approximately $4 million. Brion Grube, a 15-year veteran of the Wendy's organization, was appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of Baja Fresh. Brion brings to Baja Fresh a strong background in operations and proven experience in turning around challenged businesses. His efforts are beginning to show positive results.

6

Although Baja Fresh continues to experience challenging sales trends, we saw a significant margin improvement during 2005 by lowering food costs and implementing a new labor management system. We have also evolved the menu to meet changing consumer trends and tastes with new and promotional items such as Smokey Chili & Chicken Quesadilla, Fire Roasted Chili & Chicken Flautas and Savory, Slow Cooked Pork Carnitas. We recognize that the restaurant experience can be as important as the food. We recently opened a new Baja Fresh concept in the Philadelphia area that showcases the brand's vision for the future. The restaurant features an open kitchen, more comfortable seating, softer lighting and a

warmer color scheme. The new design also has operational benefits: the more efficient layout of the restaurant has helped lower service times to around five minutes compared to a systemwide average of almost seven minutes. The turnaround of Baja Fresh is progressing slower than we hoped, but it is moving in the right direction. We are focusing first on improving the fundamentals of the business to strengthen the economic model. We believe a cautious approach to development is prudent as we stabilize the business for future growth. In March 2006, the Board of Directors decided to explore strategic alternatives for the Baja Fresh business.

CFO's Message to Shareholders:
Cafe Express Focused On Improvement In 2005, we named Bob Wright as President of Cafe Express. Bob is a seven-year veteran of the Wendy's system, with a proven track record of success in restaurant operations. He is making progress on several initiatives to move the business forward. In 2005, we took proactive steps to position Cafe Express for improvement. Specifically, we wrote down approximately $11 million in goodwill associated with our investment in Cafe Express and incurred a market impairment charge of approximately $5 million. We believe these actions will help strengthen the brand in the long term.
s s

Our financial strategy has always been ­ and will continue to be ­ to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. As Jack Schuessler mentioned in his Chairman's letter, we announced in 2005 a series of strategic initiatives that enabled us to make significant improvements in our business and drive shareholder value. These initiatives include plans for an initial public offering of 15% to 18% of Tim Hortons, as well as several actions to improve the performance at Wendy's. The Wendy's initiatives will focus on: The sale of certain real estate properties. The closing of certain underperforming stores. Slowing new company store development. Franchising of company-owned stores.

s

Pasta Pomodoro Gaining Momentum
s

We have a 29% (fully diluted) ownership in Pasta Pomodoro. We believe the chain, with its moderate prices and fresh Italian cuisine, has strong potential for growth. The business gained momentum throughout the year, ending 2005 with double-digit gains in same-store sales and average unit sales of approximately $1.4 million. Optimistic About 2006 And Beyond Our business is undergoing a dramatic transformation. We have a clear vision, a sound strategy and solid plans in place that will translate into significant shareholder value. We are confident that we have positioned the Company for growth in 2006 and for many years to come. I thank you for your ongoing support as shareholders and customers, and look forward to sharing the results of our progress with you in the near future. Sincerely, Additional strategic initiatives include a 25% increase in our dividend rate, a $1 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization and a $100 million reduction in our long-term debt. I will address each of these individually: Company Increases Annual Dividend Rate By 25% In July, based on our strategic initiatives and cash flow projections, the Board of Directors authorized a 25% increase in our annual dividend rate. During the year, we increased our targeted dividend payout ratio to a range of 23% to 27% of net income, up from the previous range of 18% to 22%. The annual dividend rate increased from $0.54 to $0.68, beginning with the dividend paid on November 21, 2005. Share Repurchase Authorization Increased By $1 Billion Our Board of Directors also authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases in July. In 2005 and early 2006, we repurchased 5.75 million shares for approxiJohn T. Schuessler Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President mately $305 million, including accelerated repurchases in August 2005 and January 2006 of 2 million shares and 3.75 million shares, respectively. The remaining authorization for share repurchases is about $900 million.

Positioning Wendy's For The Future With New Combo Plan We recognize that the strategic initiatives we are undertaking will result in a Wendy's International, Inc. that is very different from the Wendy's of today. For this reason, we are focused on identifying efficiencies and reducing costs throughout the organization. As Jack mentioned in his letter, our new "3-Tiered, 3-Year Combo Plan" is focused on improving the Wendy's business. Our specific goals are to: drive annual same-store sales growth more than 3%, improve store-level margins 500 basis points, and reduce Since 2000, we have bought back more than 29 million shares for approximately $931 million at an average price of approximately $31 per share. Company Pays Off $100 Million Of Debt In December We used existing cash and cash flow to pay off $100 million in 6.35% notes on their scheduled maturity date of December 15. This will reduce our annual interest expense by about $6 million and enable us to maintain a strong balance sheet. Equity-Based Compensation Plan Helps Retain Talented Employees, Minimizes Dilution The goal of our equity-based compensation program is to remain competitive in attracting and retaining talented employees while minimizing EPS dilution from stock grants. In 2004, we implemented a new equity compensation program that enabled us to convert from stock options to a combination of restricted stock, restricted stock units and cash beginning in 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, we accelerated the vesting of all remaining stock options, except those held by independent Directors of the Company, to minimize the amount of equity compensation expense we will incur in future years. Going forward, we do not expect to incur Kerrii B. Anderson Chief Financial Officer costs $40 million to $60 million by the end of 2006. We are confident about the future of the Wendy's brand and are eager to begin implementing the elements of our Plan. Progress In 2005 Sets Platform For Success In 2006 And Beyond This was a year in which we unlocked significant value for our shareholders through our strategic initiatives. Our business is undergoing a dramatic transformation and, from a financial perspective, 2006 will be a transition year. We are focused on completing the IPO for Tim Hortons, which we believe will drive shareholder value. Future shareholder value will be driven by our implementation of the Combo Plan ­ a winning combination of driving sales and reducing expenses to increase profitability in 2006 and beyond. Sincerely,
