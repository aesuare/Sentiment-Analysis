Letter to Stockholders
April 23, 2007
Dear Fellow Stockholders:
In 2006, PetSmart made important investments that position us to make the most of the growth inherent in this great industry, to tap into the emotional connection our customers share with their pets, and to offer them the best in service, information and advice. We think this unique ability to create smarter pet parents is a significant competitive advantage that will allow us to continue to grow and gain share.
We added 82 net new stores in 2006, ending the year with 908 PetSmart stores in the United States and Canada. We are on pace to open about 100 net new stores in 2007, including the anticipated acquisition of 19 Super Pet stores in Canada, representing square footage growth of about 10 percent, and we remain confident that the North American market will ultimately support 1,400 stores. And as we bring more stores to our customers, we introduce them to the choices, information and expertise we offer.
Our pet services business—grooming, pet training, PetSmart PetsHotel® and Doggie Day CampSM—is the largest and fastest growing in the sector. Our services are an engine of our growth and profitability, and we believe they cannot be duplicated with the same level of success by our competitors. New pet parents are attracted to our business model and, as you can see in the previous pages, that gives us an opportunity to create strong, lasting bonds with those pet parents. Total sales in services were $376.0 million, up 25.8 percent from last year. We have committed to two additional years of services growth of at least 20 percent, bringing this streak to nine straight years.
PetSmart PetsHotel, our overnight boarding and daycare facility for dogs and cats, continues to attract new customers and give our current customers yet another reason to remain loyal to us. Our hotels are one of our biggest differentiators, offering customers a smart solution to the often troubling dilemma of what to do with their pet while they’re away. We ended 2006 with 62 hotels inside PetSmart stores. A hotel’s impact on a store’s profitability remains consistent and compelling, adding 29 percent to the total revenue of a store.
While we’re pleased with the performance of our Doggie Day Camp service, the concept is much more interesting when attached to a full PetsHotel. The hotel drives day camp trial and generates up to 40 percent of a day camp’s total revenue. In light of these numbers, we are pursuing a hybrid concept that gives our customers the best of both worlds: a PetsHotel with slightly less square footage, but one that offers rooms of the same size, as well as all of the amenities of the full-sized boarding facility and Doggie Day Camp. Because this new model is so compelling, we think it can effectively replace the stand-alone, in-store day camps originally planned, with stronger revenues and improved profitability.
As we open more hotels and better understand the market potential, and with the addition of the smaller hotel model, we now believe the total build out for PetsHotels is 435, well up from our original projection of 300. In 2007, we plan to open 35 new hotels, including about 30 standard formats and about five of the smaller versions.

                                          Our PetPerks® customer relationship marketing program is designed to deepen our understanding of our customers, create offers designed to change their behavior, and build their long-term loyalty to PetSmart by making their shopping experience more meaningful. The program is not just about traffic or coupons, it’s about increasing customer loyalty and driving spend per pet. Initiatives like the New Pet Center and the Smart Nutrition SelectorTM are based on feedback from customers who want more information and advice on how to provide the highest level of care for their pets.
The next phase of our loyalty program involves unique in-store promotions aimed directly at customer needs. In 2007, we’ll introduce an enhanced PetPerks program that includes guaranteed benefits for every member, as well as offers to thank our customers for their continued loyalty, all with the ultimate goal of driving greater profitability for PetSmart.
We’ve worked hard to create a superior customer experience. Our stores are bright, clean, and easy to shop. Our trained associates are knowledgeable and passionate, making it even easier for our customers to find the solutions they need. Our Eagle 2 stores, designed around our customers’ needs and how they shop, continue to perform extremely well. In 2007, we’ll refresh approximately 200 stores with the Eagle 2 format. We remain on track to complete every store in the chain by 2008.
We ended 2006 with $289 million in operating cash flow, giving us continued flexibility to invest in our business and its growth, while providing our shareholders with more immediate and tangible returns in the form of dividends and share buy backs. In fact, from 2004 through 2006, we returned more than $550 million, or more than 100 percent of our net income for the same time period, directly to shareholders.
This is a strong business with a solid fundamental model and plenty of opportunity. We have the cash to fuel our growth, and the right strategic initiatives to drive that growth and further set us apart from the competition. We know that we have the tools in place to help pet parents provide the absolute best care for their pets. They depend on us for information and advice. And in return, we are helping to create a smarter pet parent.
Sincerely,
Philip L. Francis
