Report to Shareholders
For the 12th consecutive year, we achieved sizable gains in revenue, earnings and patient services. Our strategy of acquiring hospitals in the non-urban Southeast and Southwest and then improving the quality of their health care while simultaneously introducing expanded medical services remains the underlying reasons for our success.

ur financial and operating results continued to reflect sizable year-to-year gains for a record twelfth year in a row. Compared with fiscal year 1999, net patient service revenues increased 16.4 percent to nearly $1.6 billion. Earnings rose 11.9 96 97 percent to $168 million, and Net Income diluted earnings per share gained $ in millions 15.3 percent to 68 cents. At fiscal year-end 2000, we had record working capital of $317 million, the lowest debt-toequity ratio among all major hospital companies in the U.S. and untapped borrowing power of $310 million. The latter provides 96 97 a solid base from which to pursue attractive acquisition candidates whenever we find them. On a year-to-year same-hospital comparison basis, occupancy rates increased to 48.5 percent from 46.8 percent; admissions rose 4.7 percent, and the number of surgeries gained

6.5 percent. Including two acquisitions made last year, total admissions were up 13.2 percent, and surgeries, 14.8 percent. Outpatient revenues comprised 52.9 percent of total revenues, up 100 basis points from 1999. We acquired two hospitals 99 00 during fiscal year 2000 and a third on the first day of fiscal year 2001. These acquisitions increased the scope of our operations by 537 licensed beds, a 12 percent capacity increase in the past year and a 33 percent gain since 1998. At year-end, including our 2001 acquisition, we owned or 99 00 operated 37 hospitals with 5,090 beds in 11 states compared with 32 hospitals with 3,821 beds in 11 states in 1998. These capacity increases in the past two years are particularly meaningful since significant growth typically occurs within the first four years following a hospital acquisition.

2000 ANNUAL REPORT

Pursuit of Quality he financial gains of last year and, for that matter, since HMA's inception 23 years ago, are the by-products of a steadfast emphasis on raising the quality of health care at every HMA hospital. Without a proven record of delivering better health care to nonurban and rural America, our hospital acquisitions would have been stymied; patient counts would have declined; and promising physician specialists would have established their practices elsewhere.

T

Improving Trends Our more mature hospitals continue to record year-to-year gains. Our recent acquisitions are beginning to experience meaningful revenue increases following substantial upgrades to their facilities, expansion of medical services and the addition of state-ofthe-art medical equipment. Operating margins are improving; our percentage of bad debts are declining; and physician recruiting remains at a record pace. The climate for Medicare reimbursement is improving. The Congress has already restored $16 billion that was taken away by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and further restorations are expected later this year. The Health Care Financing Administration indicates it will increase Medicare compensation by 2.3 percent for 2001, which will add about $12 million to our revenues. In addition, there are proposals that would increase government subsidies to non-urban hospitals for indigent care and raise the level of bad debt reimbursement over the next 10 years. Further, America's ability to fund health insurance has never been better. More than 170 million U.S. residents presently have health insurance, the highest number on record. In addition, 67 percent of small business employers now offer health insurance compared with 54 percent just two years earlier, according to a recent Kaiser Foundation study.

Investor Issues Both Moodys and Standard & Poors rated our debt securities "Investment Grade" last year. In addition, our stock received "buy" recommendations from 19 analysts last year, which undoubtedly helped our stock price increase more than 186 percent, reaching a high of $21 per share. In general, security analysts have turned bullish on health care stocks in anticipation of more favorable Medicare reimbursements and a national adoption of a universal standard for health care billing that should reduce the number of disallowed medical claims and speed the receipt of receivables. Fiscal Year 2001 Expectations The outlook is promising, and we look to achieve the following objectives in fiscal year 2001: · Revenue gains of 11-17 percent; · EBITDA of $425 million to $450 million; · Diluted earnings per share of 78-80 cents. · Same store admissions to grow 2-4 percent; · Same store surgeries to increase 4-6 percent; · Capital expenditures of $75­$85 million; · Interest costs of $18-$22 million. Should any of these projections change materially, we will notify all shareholders through press releases, quarterly reports, and postings on our Internet site. As always, we extend our thanks and appreciation to our dedicated physicians and other HMA health care professionals, our excellent vendors and our more than 19,000 employees who help to increase the quality of health care each day of the year. Sincerely,

William J. Schoen
Chairman of the Board and CEO Naples, Florida December 5, 2000
