                  GREG BROWN, Chairman & CEO
Here are just a few of our 2013 highlights:
MARCH 2014
Dear Shareholder:
2013 was a year of progress and challenge for Motorola Solutions. Our Government business demonstrated resilience and is well positioned for continued growth, and our Enterprise business is stabilizing and poised for growth. Moreover, we continued to deliver solid investor returns and made great progress in many areas.
• We returned $2 billion in capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends; $5.9 billion over the past three years.
• We generated $944 million in operating cash flow and ended the year with a total cash balance of $3.2 billion.
• The value of our stock increased 21 percent in 2013 and 70 percent since it began trading as MSI on January 4, 2011.
• We acquired Twisted Pair Solutions to accelerate push-to-talk over broadband interoperability with our MOTOTRBOTM radio network.
• We continued to invest in our core value of innovation, funding $1.1 billion in research and development.
• We were named to the Fortune Most Admired Companies and the Global 100 Most Sustainable Companies lists.
As we celebrated our 85th year in business in 2013, we reflected on the qualities that give Motorola Solutions its strength. We’re trusted by our customers because of the history of partnership and innovation we’ve established with them. We’re showing our customers a vision of the future and focusing our dialogue around their challenges, showing them how we can provide solutions that deliver a high return on investment.
One example from our Government business is the introduction of our Real-Time Crime Center solution for public safety customers. It incorporates input from multiple data sources such as video, sensors, alarms, computer-aided dispatch and records to deliver one operational view that helps public safety officers stay one step ahead of criminals through proactive policing. And in Enterprise, we are helping manufacturers succeed with technology solutions that connect them to the real-time informational intelligence they need to shave seconds off production times, drive down defects and work more safely.

The fundamental demand drivers for our business remain solid, and we continue to invest and innovate for profitable growth. As a shareholder, you can be confident in our strong balance sheet, which provides a solid foundation and flexibility that should enable our company to thrive in the years ahead.
On behalf of our 21,000 employees, I thank you for continued confidence in our company.
