Letter to Operations Financial Atmos Energy Board of Corporate Shareholders Review Review Officers Directors Information
      DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDER:
Our 2004 fiscal year will stand as one of the biggest years in Atmos Energy’s history. Not only did we do well financially, we virtually doubled in size to become the largest pure-gas utility in America. However, size is
only important if it is accompanied by performance, and Atmos Energy performed exceptionally well in 2004.
Consolidated net income rose to $86.2 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, compared with $71.7 million,
or $1.54 per diluted share, in 2003. Our total return to shareholders was an enviable 10.4 percent, including cash dividends of $1.22 paid during fiscal 2004. Return on average shareholders’ equity was 9.1 percent.
Based on these strong results and our positive forecast for 2005, the Board of Directors increased the annual indicated dividend rate by 2 cents to $1.24 per share. The increase marked our 17th consecutive annual dividend increase. When adjusted for mergers and acquisitions, Atmos Energy has paid higher dividends every year since its founding in 1983. Fewer than 2.5 percent
of American corporations can match
our dividend history.
TXU GAS ACQUISITION
Our 2004 results were exceeded only by the leap we made in our regulated operations. On October 1, 2004, we completed our acquisition of the
naturalgasdistributionandpipelineoperationsofTXU Gas Company. This acquisition added 1.5 million utility customers in one of the more dynamic American growth markets. It also placed us in an excellent position to benefit in the future for the following reasons: Immediate contribution to 2005 earnings. We expect that the operations of our new Mid-Tex Division will con- tribute from 5 cents to 10 cents to earnings per share in 2005. We are forecasting our earnings per diluted share
in fiscal 2005 to be between $1.65 and $1.75. Above-average residential and commercial growth. Our new division serves rapidly growing communities in
the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex and northern suburbs of Austin. The division’s net growth in customers
is approximately 2 percent a year, almost double our former growth rate.
Added value from new gas pipeline operations. The intrastate pipeline we acquired as part of the TXU Gas operations runs from one end of Texas to the other.
It interconnects at three of the state’s major hubs, or gas

transfer points, with dozens of other intrastate and interstate gas pipelines. The 6,162-mile pipeline system delivers gas to the 550 cities served by the
new division. Owning this asset gives us expansion opportunities to transport more natural gas for others besides our own utility operations.

  Dedicated and experienced employees. Our new division already was a well-run natural gas system. Its 1,344 gas professionals who transferred to Atmos Energy are work- ing to integrate the operations as soon as possible and are contributing their “knowledge capital” to benefit our entire system.
Prompt recovery of new capital investment. Texas law permits a utility to make annual adjustments for additions to net plant, using its most recent return on investment, depreciation rate and tax rates. The law lets us recover our capital invest-
ment in new
pipelines and
other facilities
much faster
without having
to file a general
rate case. As we invest in our expanding Texas markets, we will be able to earn a return on our investment faster than in most of our other jurisdictions.
About 90 percent of earnings from regulated operations. Adding the TXU Gas properties has increased the propor- tion of our assets regulated by state commissions. Many investors see this increase as positive because, although it does not guarantee our profitability, it increases our opportunity for consistent, long-term earnings growth.
SUCCESSFUL FINANCINGS
Atmos Energy paid approximately $1.905 billion in cash for the TXU Gas operations. To finance the acquisition, we sold 9.9 million shares of common stock through
a public offering in July. Because of strong interest, the offering raised approximately $235.7 million in net proceeds, with the purchasers mainly being retail holders.
In October 2004, we made another public offering, selling 16.1 million common shares to raise approximately $382.5 million in net proceeds before other offering costs.
The purchasers were mainly large institu- tional holders. In a separate offering at the same time, we
also sold four series of senior unsecured notes to raise net proceeds of approximately $1.39 billion.
We are gratified by the success of all three offerings. We believe the prices that investors bid indicate the market’s confidence in our ability to integrate and operate the TXU Gas operations successfully. Within the next three to five years, we expect to apply some of the additional cash flow from the new operations to return to a 50 percent to 55 percent debt-to-capitalization
ratio, as we have done consistently after completing our nine previous major acquisitions.
COMPLEMENTARY NONUTILITY OPERATIONS
Our nonutility operations achieved impressive results in fiscal 2004, building on initiatives begun in 2003 to reduce the risk from volatile natural gas prices. The con- tribution to net income from our nonutility operations
in 2004 was 27 percent. We expect these contributions to remain strong during the next five years.
One of the keys to our nonutility growth will
be managing the pipeline and storage assets acquired with TXU Gas. Although these assets remain regulated, we expect to operate them to deliver more volumes to whole- sale customers. We also are working on optimizing our nonutility natural gas marketing and storage operations. During 2004, for example, we made changes in the
way we procure the billions of cubic feet of natural gas for our utility system to take better advantage of our nonutility operations’ expertise.
CONCENTRATION ON PERFORMANCE
Our goal has been to provide an attractive rate of return through both capital appreciation and dividends. We expect earnings per share to grow between 3 percent and 6 percent a year and our dividend yield to remain an attractive 4 percent to 5 percent.
We expect to provide investors with a total annual return between 8 percent and 11 percent. We have done this consistently in the past and expect to continue to do so in the future. We have accomplished this through an
intense focus on improving efficiency and managing costs, mitigating the effects of weather on our utility operations and fostering productive relationships with the regulators in our operating jurisdictions.
We also have been successful because of our focus on the basics. While many in the industry are claiming a return to the basics, we can confidently say we never left the basics. We always have been dedicated to natural gas distribution as our core business.
KEEPING RATES CURRENT
In 2004, we added $16.2 million in net revenues through rate increases. During the next five years, we expect to receive approximately $15 million to $20 million in average annual rate increases. One of our goals is to monitor our rates of return in all jurisdictions to keep our actual returns as close as possible to our allowed rates of return.
In states that have warmer winters, we have sought to adjust our rates using a weather normalization adjust- ment. We now have WNA or higher base rates in our eight largest states. Only about 17 percent of our margins
are exposed to weather in the 2004 –2005 heating season.
We have proposed other rate adjustments to offset the effects of declining natural gas consumption. Nationally, gas consumption has been going down about 2 percent a year during the past decade. We also have sought to recoup higher collection expenses and to recover bad debt expense incurred during winter cutoff moratoriums.
                                                                                                                                             Excellence in customer service stands as a key part of our corporate vision– we call it our Spirit of Service.SM

   In addition, we have advocated that states adopt a measure similar to a Texas law that allows for faster recognition in rates of essential capital investment needed to maintain the system and serve new customers. The Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program in Texas reduces the effects of regulatory lag on cash flow and earnings.
CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENCE
Excellence in customer service stands as a key part of our corporate vision—we call it our Spirit of Service.SM
Our reputation in the community is directly influenced by how we perform. During the past two years, we
have conducted extensive training efforts and intend to expand the programs further in 2005. We also are organizing programs to help our employees better under- stand the dynamics of our business as it grows.
INVESTMENT IN A STRONG CORPORATE CULTURE
Another intangible, but essential, investment that we are
major acquisitions into our operations, we have found that our values make a tangible difference. Having the right corporate culture guides us in dealing appropriately with business issues. Moreover, the right corporate culture emphasizes to our employees the values and integrity on which we will continue to grow.
NEED FOR A NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
With the contentious 2004 elections now past, we trust that Congress and the Administration can focus on one of the most pressing national issues that received almost no attention during the campaign—the need for a comprehensive national energy policy.
Natural gas prices have continued to rise during the past five years. In the 2004–2005 heating season, home heating bills will likely go up from 10 percent to 15 percent above bills of last winter. These price increases are the result of normal market responses. Yet, that response is prompted by our nation’s lack
of a national energy policy.
Industry experts estimate that large resources of natural gas remain to be tapped. However, only when additional supplies come to market will gas com- modity prices moderate and reduce the volatility of gas price spikes that are hurting consumers, businesses and utilities alike.
BOARD CHANGES
Two significant milestones in our corporate governance occurred during 2004. The first was the retirement of one of our longtime directors, Carl S. Quinn. Carl’s service
to Atmos Energy was matched only by his legacy in the natural gas industry as one of its leading statesmen. We shall miss his wise counsel, steady direction and solid integrity.
However, we were pleased in August when we marked a second milestone, the addition of our first woman director, Nancy K. Quinn. Ms. Quinn brings a wealth of experience in investment banking and energy industry financing. She also is a respected woman entre- preneur and benefactor of the arts. We feel honored that she agreed to join our board.
FUTURE EXPECTATIONS
As we look to 2005, we are excited about the tremendous potential that we foresee. Our acquisition of TXU Gas has given us greater size and scale. Our existing utility operations continue to achieve exceptional results. Our non- utility operations are positioned to make
complementary contributions in the future.
We remain committed to keeping Atmos Energy a
financially successful company by showing respect for
all who deal with us and by expecting the highest ethical behavior of all who work for us. We anticipate growing earnings at 3 percent to 6 percent a year and continuing to pay higher annual dividends. Being financially successful is the best way we can reward our investors, serve our customers, invest in our employees and contribute to our 1,500 communities.
We intend to continue to operate the business through a dedication to a strong financial foundation,
a disciplined attitude to operations, a successful approach to making and integrating acquisitions, a devotion to serve our customers exceptionally well and an adherence to our core values.

pursuing is to build a strong corporate culture. In 2004, we took additional steps to invest in our employees through expanded training, improved benefits programs and increased communications.
Instilling our core values through- out the organization is essential to
our future success. As we have integrated
