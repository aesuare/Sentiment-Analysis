Dear Stockholder:

Fiscal 2006 marked our 20th anniversary as a public company and our 40th year in business. We commend our associates for their accomplishments and for the tremendous organization they have helped to create. We went public in July 1986 with stockholders' equity of $22.3 million. Since then, our book value has grown to more than $3.4 billion, a compound average annual growth rate through FYE 2006 of 28%. As we write this, our stock price, at $32.30 per share, has risen approximately 3,000% from the day we offered it to the public; during the same period the S&P 500 has grown 490%. We have evolved from a small regional builder with $120 million in revenues to the nation's leading builder of luxury homes with revenues in FY 2006 of over $6.1 billion -- our highest total ever.

Insiders own about 30% of our stock. We are keenly focused on the fact that today's $32.30 share price, although up 45% from its recent low of $22.22 in July 2006, is still down 45% from its peak of $58.67 in July 2005. We assure our fellow stockholders that we will not be satisfied until our earnings, revenues, backlog, and contracts are once again setting new records. Challenging Market Conditions We are in the 15th month of the downside of the current cycle. We believe we are dealing with it appropriately. In March 2006, we secured a new $1.8 billion bank credit facility, an increase from our previous $1.2 billion facility, which extends through March 2011. We ended FY 2006 with roughly $1.1 billion unused and available under this credit line, over $600 million in cash on hand, and no major corporate debt maturities until 2011. We believe we are ready to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in this market. We have trimmed our land holdings by 19% from a high of 91,200 lots controlled at FY 2006's secondquarter end to 74,000 at FYE 2006 ­ this compares to 83,000 lots at FYE 2005. By reevaluating and renegotiating many of our land options, we were able to maintain those we believe will be most profitable, while shedding those that appeared to be marginal in the current climate. We ended our fiscal year with a conservative net debt-to-capital ratio* of under 32%, our second lowest ever. On November 1, 2006, we held our annual "check-ups" with Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investor Service, and Standard & Poor's, the three rating agencies that cover our industry. Based on these meetings, we believe we will continue to be rated investment grade by each. These ratings should continue to facilitate our ability to access capital at very competitive prices in the public markets going forward.

From 1991 to 2003, the home building industry enjoyed solid, stable, and sustainable growth, a long period for what is generally thought to be a cyclical industry. In 2004 and 2005, the new home market experienced unusual acceleration in demand, and home prices rose at an unsustainable pace. This growth was fueled by an influx of speculative investors and by some buyers overreaching to chase rapidly rising home prices. Demand began to weaken in early September 2005, which drove many speculators to the sell window all at once. This is the first downturn in the 40 years since we entered the business that was not precipitated by high interest rates, a weak economy, job losses, or other macroeconomic factors. Instead, it seems to be the result of an oversupply of inventory and a decline in home buyer confidence. Speculative buyers who spurred demand in 2004 and 2005 are now sellers; builders that built speculative homes must now move their specs through aggressive discounting; and nervous buyers are canceling contracts for homes already under construction, thus bringing even more unsold product to market. Although our policies restrict our own production of speculative housing, and even though we typically require a binding contract with, on average, a 7% down payment before we start a buyer's home, we nonetheless have felt the ripple effect of lost buyer confidence as our own cancellation rates rose in the second, third, and fourth quarters of FY 2006. Some land deals that were made on the basis of 2004 and 2005 market conditions no longer made sense when viewed in the context of 2006 demand, so impairment charges and write-offs became the order of the day. We took $152 million in pre-tax write-offs and write-downs in FY 2006, which, on an after-tax basis, represented about 2.7% of our FYE 2006 book value.

In this difficult environment, our team performed admirably. FY 2006 revenues of $6.12 billion were our highest ever. Net income of $687.2 million, $4.17 per share diluted, was our second highest ever. Return on beginning equity was 25%. The impact of the weakened market was evident in our sales contracts of $4.46 billion, which were down 38% from FY 2005 and contributed to a 25% decline in year-end backlog to $4.49 billion. Given the rise in cancellation rates, projecting future revenues and earnings is a challenge. Based on current market conditions and our fiscal year-end contracts and backlog, we are estimating FY 2007 revenues of between $4.34 billion and $5.10 billion and earnings of between $260 million and $340 million, or between $1.58 and $2.08 per share diluted.* Lessons from the Past We have learned by managing through four previous downturns ­ 1968, 1974, 1980-1982, and 1988-1991 ­ that times of stress in our industry often produce unexpected opportunities for those with capital, strong reputations, and solid management. The last major downturn, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, provided a springboard for us to expand into Northern Virginia, the New York City suburbs, southern Connecticut, metro Los Angeles, and San Francisco. In that period we took the first major steps to becoming the national brand for luxury new homes. Looking Forward Right now is a great time to buy a new luxury home. Builders are motivated to sell their specs, and many of the fundamentals that typically lead our industry out of a slowdown are already in place. Interest rates are near historic lows, unemployment is near an all-time low, and the stock market is setting records. We believe we are well-positioned for a market rebound. We have an experienced and seasoned management team, the industry's leading brand name, a portfolio of well-located properties, and a broad array of product lines to attract urban and suburban luxury home buyers at most stages of their lives. Spectacular demographics buoy the luxury market. Twenty-five years ago, there were 6.3 million households earning $100,000 or more in FY 2005 dollars. Today, there are nearly 19.7 million. These affluent

families now represent 17% of all U.S. households compared to 7.7% in 1980. The luxury market has the largest pool of potential buyers in its history, and we are the leading name in that niche. A recent Harvard University study estimates that, based in part on projected household growth of 14.6 million during the next ten years (compared to 12.6 million in the previous ten years), our nation will need to produce over 2 million new housing units annually. Bringing enough home sites through heavily regulated government approval processes to meet this need will be a major challenge. Our industry, on average, builds no more homes today than we did in the 1970s, although the U.S. has added 70% more households. While currently there is an oversupply of inventory on the market, we believe it is temporary. Consistent with trends over the past thirty years, we think that securing land approvals will continue to get more difficult. When the current excess inventory is absorbed, those who control land and can get it approved will profit. In the current weak housing climate, land developers and home builders have not been pushing new lot supplies through the approval pipeline. This could result in a near-term shortage of home sites once demand for new homes rebounds. With our land supply, and approval and development expertise, we believe this trend favors us. We continue to expand into new product lines and introduce existing product lines into new territories. We are bringing the Toll Brothers brand to the infill high-rise business, with new buildings rising in several key metro New York City markets: Hoboken and Jersey City, New Jersey; and Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens, New York. We have yet to introduce our active-adult communities, currently offered predominantly in our Northeast and Mid-Atlantic markets, into most of our Sun Belt markets, which should offer dramatic growth potential for us as the baby boomers mature. And we are broadening our suburban high-density and resort-style product lines to complement our strong position in the moveup and empty-nester luxury markets. Many potential buyers, unsure of the direction of home prices, are waiting on the sidelines, creating pentup demand. We believe buyer confidence will return; the demographics will prevail; we will get back on track; and those who thought about buying homes but didn't will kick themselves for waiting. As we look back from our position now as the sixth largest home builder by revenues in the United States, we applaud the tremendous team at Toll Brothers, whose diligence and commitment have brought us here. We also thank the thousands of home buyers who have put their faith in us over the past 40 years, our excellent subcontractor and supplier partners, and our stockholders for their support.
