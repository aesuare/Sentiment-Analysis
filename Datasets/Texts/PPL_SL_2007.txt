James H. Miller
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
As I meet with investors, employees and others, I’m frequently asked about PPL’s long- term strategy for growth. The tone of those questions often implies that we have a secret formula to ensure our success, a plan that will take the competition by surprise.
There is, of course, no such magic plan.
Yes, we have a very solid strategy to grow your company. The strategy itself, however, is not unique. The approach we are pursuing could, potentially, be adopted by many companies in our sector.
What is it then, that sets PPL apart, that has allowed us to significantly outperform most of our peers in the electricity business and the major U.S. stock indices?
The essence of our success, I believe, is our unwavering, pervasive focus on executing the business plans that we put in place. Whether they are an executive, a power plant operator, a trader on our marketing floor or a lineman, PPL people are knowledgeable and dedicated, understanding that success is not guaranteed, it is earned every day.
For example, in our marketing and trading operation, PPL people have a superb understanding of energy markets, allowing us to maximize the value of our outstanding generating assets. This operation has significantly improved earnings over what we would have been able to achieve simply by selling our power plants’ electricity at prevailing market prices. Because of its strategic importance to our ongoing success, we are continuing to expand both the size and the skills of our marketing and trading operation. As we do so,
of course, we’re continuing to appropriately manage our risks.
Dear
Shareowners,
 PPL Corporation 2007 Annual Report 

 PPL Corporation 2007 Annual Report
Our marketing and trading successes clearly illustrate the advantages that exceptional people, high-performing assets and a clear understanding of markets can bring to the bottom line.
This attention-to-detail approach also serves us very well in operating more than
35 power plants at locations in six U.S. states. And PPL’s electricity delivery businesses in the United States and the United Kingdom consistently earn the highest accolades for providing exceptional customer service.
PPL people have delivered on the promises we have made to you, our shareowners.
Our 2007 reported earnings were $3.35 per share, a 50 percent increase over 2006. While 67 cents per share of that increase resulted from the sale of our Latin American electricity delivery businesses, earnings from ongoing operations also increased signifi- cantly, to a record $2.60 per share, a 16 percent increase over the prior year.
In 2007, earnings from ongoing operations in our U.S. generation and marketing business increased by 20 percent, to $1.42 per share. This unregulated part of our business accounted for 55 percent of our 2007 earnings from ongoing operations.
This kind of performance, combined with continued investor interest in our sector, resulted in an excellent total return for our shareowners in 2007: 49 percent. In the past five years, PPL’s total return has been 254 percent, more than three times the return of
the S&P 500 Index. Your company now is among the 10 largest electricity companies in the United States.
Even as we expand PPL, we also continue to grow your dividend. With our February announcement of a 10 percent increase, our annualized dividend now is $1.34 per share, a figure that is 74 percent higher than it was just five years ago.
The future looks bright as well. We are now forecasting 2010 earnings of $4.00 to $4.60 per share, the midpoint of which would be a 65 percent increase over our 2007 per share earnings from ongoing operations.
Clearly, we are focused on execution so that we get the most out of the assets we currently have, but we also are actively positioning the company for expansions that will further grow value for shareowners.
In the evolving U.S. electricity business, no one can accurately predict the future. It’s impossible, for example, to precisely forecast the prices of various fuels, the impact
of environmental regulations, actions that might alter competitive generation markets
or technological advances in electricity generation.
Given the uncertainties in this sector, we think the wise course is to create a wide range of opportunities, so that we’re ready to act when the time is right.

That’s the reason we are pursuing a construction and operating license for a potential new nuclear unit in Pennsylvania. That’s why we are seeking approvals to double our hydro- electric generating capacity in Pennsylvania. That’s why we are planning to spend more than $100 million to develop new renewable energy projects. And that’s why we are continuing
to enhance our marketing operation in anticipation of a wider retail market for electricity.
To be an industry leader, you need to be in the right place at the right time. But being in that right place doesn’t happen by accident.
At PPL, we are committed to growing value for you today – and to ensuring that we are in the right place to take advantage of the opportunities that the future will bring.
On behalf of all the employees of PPL, I thank you for your investment in our company, and I pledge our continued commitment to growing value for you.
Sincerely,
James H. Miller
