2014
EMCOR had a very strong 2014. We generated revenues of $6.42 billion, $2.59 in diluted EPS, and a stellar $247 million in operating cash flow, and expanded operating margins from 3.8 percent to 4.5 percent. It was a terrific year.

It was a terrific year.

We accomplished important goals in 2014 that will serve us well into the future. For example, we substantially completed the closure of our UK Construction business that had a history of under-performance. Our UK team executed this closure well, and now we have a focused Building Services business in the UK that can earn acceptable and more predictable returns. In 2013, we executed a transformative deal when we purchased RepconStrickland. Its integration is largely

complete and the accelerating performance in that business in 2014 shows that we are on the right track. The acquisition of RepconStrickland brought our Industrial Services segment to scale, and we are proud to call RepconStrickland an EMCOR company. EMCOR is a company whose core product is the application of skilled labor performing mission critical work in challenging environments. On any given day, EMCOR companies are performing some of the most technically sophisticated specialty construction, maintenance and service projects, tasks and programs for our customers. We succeed because we have the best tradespeople led by superb technical supervision under the guidance and leadership

We make sure that all of our employees have the appropriate safety equipment and training. The simple goal from top to bottom is zero accidents. One of the cornerstones of our success is that we have created a rich learning environment at EMCOR through our peer groups, formal technical and management training, and executive development. We have had great success developing executive and local leaders through our Leaders of Character program. We have now put over 250 of our top leaders through this program. We think our training differentiates

us from our competitors, and it is one of the key foundations of our current and future success. We believe that we must couple superior performance with adherence to our corporate values, and we have a demonstrated track record of success in both areas.
