to our shareholders
We are pleased to report record sales and earnings per share for Genuine Parts Company in 2010. The improving market conditions in the industries that we serve, which we began to see in the latter part of 2009, continued throughout the year and they further supported our internal growth initiatives, resulting in the strong performance for the year.
For 2010, total Company sales were $11.2 billion, an increase of 11% compared to 2009. Net earnings for the year were $476 million, which is a 19% increase compared to 2009, and earnings per share were $3.00 compared to $2.50 in the prior year, an increase of 20%. Entering 2010, we believed that the Company was well positioned to show improved sales and earnings results as the economy began to gradually improve. Our 2010 results would serve to validate this position and, combined with the long-term positive fundamentals for all four of our businesses, we move into 2011 with a sense of optimism.
FinanCial strEngth
You may recall that in our 2009 letter, we stated that our primary areas of focus in each of our business segments for 2010 were to produce positive sales results, improve operating margins, generate solid cash flows and maintain a strong balance sheet. We are pleased with our progress in each of these key areas, and we continue to see opportunities for additional improvements in 2011.
Our 11% sales increase for the Company was driven by positive sales growth in all four of our businesses and the 50 basis point improvement in total operating margin reflects margin expansion in our automotive, industrial and office products segments.
Genuine Parts also remains in excellent financial condition, as we further strengthened our balance sheet and we generated solid cash flows throughout 2010. Our ongoing asset management and working capital initiatives helped us improve our cash position to $530 million at December 31, 2010. For the year, cash from operations totaled approximately $679 million and, after dividends paid of $258 million and capital expenditures of $85 million, our free cash flow was approximately $335 million. At December 31, 2010, our total debt was $500 million, which was unchanged from the prior year and represents a modest 15% of total capitalization.
During the year we made three strategic bolt-on type acquisitions, ranging from $10 million to $140 million
in annual revenues. These new businesses positively impacted our Industrial and Electrical segments in 2010 and are meaningful for their future growth. Strategic acquisitions are an important part of our ongoing growth strategies in each of our businesses. We have made
two acquisitions thus far in 2011, and we anticipate additional acquisition opportunities in the year ahead.
We also repurchased approximately 1.85 million shares of our Company stock in 2010, and we continue to view this as a good use of our cash. As of December 31, 2010, we were authorized to repurchase up to 16.0 million shares, and we expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases during 2011.
opErations
As mentioned earlier, all four of our business segments produced positive sales results in 2010. The Automotive Group, our largest segment, reported a 7% sales increase for the year, and we were encouraged to see our automotive sales momentum strengthen as the year progressed. Revenue was up 6% in the first quarter, followed by 7% increases in the second and third quarters, and then a 9% increase in the final quarter. Based
upon these favorable trends and the underlying positive fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, we enter the new year with a level of confidence that we can show continued progress in our Automotive business in 2011.
The Industrial segment is our second largest business, and they had a splendid year in 2010. Motion Industries, our industrial distribution company, generated a 22% sales increase for the year and they benefited from the combination of good internal growth initiatives and the strong rebound that occurred across the manufacturing sector of the economy this past year. This is Motion’s customer base and based upon the current level of manufacturing activity in North America, it appears that 2011 should be another good year for our industrial business. Staying within the manufacturing segment of the economy, EIS, our Electrical/Electronic distribution company, had a terrific year as well. Sales were up 30% and, as with Motion Industries, it appears that demand from the EIS customer base should remain strong on into 2011.

Revenues at S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group, were up just slightly over 2009. However, we were encouraged by their 3% sales increase in the fourth quarter. This is significant, as the industry-wide slowdown in office products consumption has pressured this segment for some time now, and the fourth quarter of 2010 marks the first positive sales comparison for this business since the second quarter of 2007. We expect to show more steady and consistent sales growth in 2011 through the combination of well-executed sales initiatives and the further recovery of economic conditions affecting this industry, such as office employment.
