LETTER TO
SHAREHOLDERS
CHANGE.
Change is a fact of life for everyone and everything – large corporations included. At ONEOK, we do not stand idly by, wait for change to happen and then worry how we should react. Instead, we anticipate, create and embrace change and seize opportunities.
Since I wrote to you a year ago, we have captured remarkable opportunities that will provide exceptional value for ONEOK shareholders. Equally important, we worked diligently and effectively throughout the year to produce operating results that, on a whole, were outstanding.
Clearly, we enjoyed a great and eventful year. In my almost 32 years with this organization, I have never been more excited about its future. I write this with pride and confidence as we move toward the company’s one-hundredth anniversary this fall.
DURING 2005 WE:
• Acquired an excellent and long-sought natural gas liquids business that provides us with a powerful new link in our energy chain.
• Exitedtheoilandgasproductionbusiness,sellingtheseassetsatatop-marketprice. • Increased the stock dividend by 12 percent, marking the sixth increase since 2002. • Implemented a new rate structure in Oklahoma for our distribution customers. • Continually made changes to improve performance in each division.
• Sold certain natural gas gathering and processing assets in Texas, lowering our exposure to commodity-price risks and reducing capital expenditures.
