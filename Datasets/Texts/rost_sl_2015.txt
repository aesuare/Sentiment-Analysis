To Our Stockholders
Our top priority will always be delivering the best values possible to our customers every day. After all, it's all about the bargains! Our ability to successfully deliver on this mission enabled us to achieve another year of solid increases in both sales and earnings.

Record Financial Results on Top of Strong Multi-Year Gains For the fiscal year ended January 30, 2016, sales grew 8% to $11.9 billion, up from $11.0 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015. Comparable store sales for 2015 increased 4%. Net earnings in 2015 grew to $1.021 billion, up from $925 million in the prior year, while earnings per share increased 14% to $2.51 on top of strong multi-year gains. Fiscal 2015 operating margin rose 10 basis points to a record 13.6%, benefiting from a combination of higher merchandise gross margin and strong expense control. Ongoing Store Growth and Expansion into Newer Markets As planned, the Company opened 84 net new locations during the year, consisting of 64 Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. We ended 2015 with a combined 1,446 stores in 34 states, the District of Columbia and Guam. Our store growth included continued expansion of Ross Dress for Less in established regions as well as the newer Midwest markets we entered beginning in 2011. In 2015, we opened our first store in Wisconsin and by the end of 2015, we operated a total of 99 Ross locations across Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Kansas, and Wisconsin. dd's DISCOUNTS also continued its expansion, focusing primarily on its largest markets of California, Texas, and Florida. For 2016, we expect to open about 70 new Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS stores. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about ten older stores. Over the long term, we continue to believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow to a chain of at least 2,000 locations across the United States and dd's DISCOUNTS can eventually expand to about 500 stores. Combined, this reflects the potential domestic capacity of about 2,500 locations, providing us with significant store growth opportunities. Sales and Profit Gains Continue at dd's DISCOUNTS In 2015, dd's DISCOUNTS posted another year of solid increases in sales and operating profits. Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS' healthy performance reflects its ability to offer customers the compelling bargains they seek.

Strong Cash Flows Fund Growth and Higher Stock Repurchases and Dividends Operating cash flows in 2015 helped fund new store expansion and additional infrastructure improvements to support our long-term growth. We invested approximately $370 million of capital during the year, including about $230 million to open new locations and update existing stores, and $140 million primarily for distribution and information technology projects. We ended the year with approximately $763 million in cash and short-term investments and $396 million in long-term debt. For fiscal 2016, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $425 million to fund new store openings, update existing stores as well as make ongoing distribution, and information technology investments. During 2015, we repurchased $700 million of common stock, or about 13.7 million shares, under the two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors at the beginning of 2015. Our Board also recently approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $.135 per share, up 15% on top of an 18% increase in the prior year. We also effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend paid on June 11, 2015. The continued growth of our stockholder payouts and our most recent stock split reflect our ongoing confidence in the Company's ability to generate future increases in sales and earnings that will yield significant amounts of cash after funding our growth and the other capital needs of our business. We have repurchased stock as planned every year since 1993 and have also raised our quarterly cash dividend annually since its inception in 1994. Flexible Business Model Enhances Long-Term Profitability We are pleased with the record sales and earnings results we achieved in 2015 on top of strong multi-year comparisons. These results reflect the resilience of our off-price business model and are also a testament to the talented individuals throughout our organization. Over the long-term, we remain confident about our prospects for respectable sales and earnings growth. This is based on our belief that the off-price sector will remain a strong-performing segment of retail, especially given consumers' ongoing focus on value. Equally important is our proven ability to maximize our favorable industry position by consistently delivering the exceptional values our customers have come to expect. Social Responsibility at Ross The six Ross Dress for Less stores we opened in Northern California in 1982 have grown into the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,274 locations at the end of 2015. dd's DISCOUNTS, which we launched in 2004, had 172 stores at year end. Our success over the past 33 years has been driven by an unwavering commitment to creating value, with a focus on excellence, ethics and integrity in all we do. This extends far beyond our mission of offering customers great name brand bargains. It also means enhancing the lives of almost 78,000 associates by providing a work environment in which they can grow and succeed. Our greatest assets are the people who work in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate and buying offices. All of our associates play an integral role in delivering great value to our customers.
