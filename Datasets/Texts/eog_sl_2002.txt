We’re the right company, in the right place, at the right time.

Now is the time for North American natural gas and now is the time for EOG Resources. We’re the right company, in the right place, at the right time. The North American supply of natural gas continues to decrease while demand for fuel-efficient, clean burning natural gas is likely to grow. Our persistence and dis- cipline in concentrating EOG’s exploration and development efforts largely on North American natural gas are aligned to continue to help the United States meet its energy needs.
On the supply side of the North American natural gas picture, we foresee a ‘perfect storm’ brewing: a disturbing, unprecedented convergence of market forces related directly to the three longstanding bases in the North American natural gas market grid — the U.S., Canada and Mexico. From 1994 through 2001, the U.S. recorded flat natural gas production of approximately 52 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd), while natural gas demand increased to 62 Bcfd. In 2002, we estimate total U.S. natural gas supply decreased 5 percent, the largest drop in 17 years. In 2003, we estimate supply could fall another 1 to 3 percent to approximately 47.5 Bcfd.
In the past, natural gas from Canada provided a safety valve, flowing as needed across the border to fill the 10 Bcfd gap. Those days may be gone, based on steadily dwindling Canadian natural gas reserves and the increase in inherent decline rates in mature basins. After reaching a peak in 2001, Canadian produc- tion declined in 2002, the first time since 1986.
While Mexico was another source of U.S. supply in the past, it currently imports 0.6 Bcfd of natural gas from the United States. By 2006, estimates pre- dict that figure will increase to at least 1 Bcfd. This ‘perfect storm’ confluence of events is expected to be a multi-year phenomenon that pushes natural gas prices substantially higher than historic levels.
Drilling activity in North America has not yet responded to the recent higher natural gas prices. Substantial new supplies of natural gas are not expected to hit the U.S. market until 2007 at the earliest, when a Mackenzie Delta pipeline from Canada is constructed, or relief is provided by increased liquified natural gas (LNG) infrastructure and imports.

Year-end Reserves
(Bcfe)
Demand for natural gas, on the other hand, has remained strong. Thus, from a producer’s perspective, the North American natural gas market is the ‘sweet spot’ of the entire worldwide energy picture. This reinforces EOG’s belief that North America is an excellent place to be positioned for the foreseeable future.
Consistency remains our catchphrase
EOG’s business and operations strategy for 2003 and beyond is consistent with the game plan we have reiterated in prior years. We are heavily weighted toward North American natural gas, which currently represents 73 percent of our total production.
We find natural gas and oil the old-fashioned way — through drilling and exploration.
With our consistent ‘growth through the drillbit’ strategy, we have created a ‘prospect generating franchise’ — a bright, dedicated workforce whose passion is finding new reserves of natural gas and oil. We continue to add to EOG’s talent pool, attracting more exceptional men and women to work in the nine decentral- ized divisions. From time to time, EOG makes tactical acquisitions but has gen- erally steered away from the purchase of large concentrations of reserves through major mergers and acquisitions. In 2002, EOG was the fifth most active U.S. driller and the third most active driller in Canada.
One of the primary growth drivers of natural gas in prior years and again in 2002 was our ongoing shallow natural gas program in Canada. EOG drilled approximately 1,100 wells in 2002 and the goal in 2003 is to repeat a high level of activity with the same level of success.
Noteworthy in EOG’s Corpus Christi Division was a 16,000-foot discovery in the Wilcox Trend that hit a December 2002 exit rate of over 40 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd), net. EOG also scored several discoveries in the Roleta Trend. Additionally, EOG achieved significant recent success in the Frio Trend, where we expect to drill 20 to 30 wells in 2003. In West Texas, EOG holds a majority interest in a sizeable horizontal Devonian play where a typical well,

the George Weir 14 No. 1H, initially flowed approximately 6 MMcfd of nat- ural gas with 700 barrels per day of condensate. Eleven out of 12 Mesaverde wells in the Denver Division proved successful, while in the Oklahoma City Division, production increased from 65 to 85 MMcfd during 2002. Consist- ent with our strategy, this was all through the drillbit.
Elsewhere, EOG’s Trinidad operations picked up tremendous momentum in 2002, turning into a dynamic, high growth rate operation. It is now set up for long-term production increases at a favorable after-tax rate of return. Highlights of the year include the Parula natural gas discovery with net reserves of 250 bil- lion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) on the offshore SECC Block booked at year-end. In addition, EOG’s license on the 78,000-acre SECC Block was extended 25 years to 2029. EOG was awarded two new offshore blocks: the 90,000-acre Lower Reserve “L” and the 96,000-acre Modified U(b). EOG is supplying approximately 50 MMcfd, net of natural gas to the CNC Ammonia Plant that commenced operation in 2002. EOG expects to supply a second ammonia plant, Nitro 2000, with approximately 50 MMcfd, net of natural gas. It is targeted to come on line in 2005. Because natural gas is the primary feedstock in the pro- duction of ammonia, Trinidad production may displace U.S. and Canadian ammonia plant output that could shut down due to high feedstock costs. Along with LNG, this creates a tie between the natural gas markets in North America and Trinidad.
Since becoming a wholly independent company in 1999, EOG has consis- tently posted excellent reserve results. For the three-year period 2000 through 2002, we averaged 182 percent reserve replacement at a worldwide finding cost of $1.17 per Mcfe.
2002 performance sets the stage
Although a shadow blanketed corporate America with regard to earnings efficacy in 2002, a major U.S. investment house rated EOG’s financials and reserve book- ings as the most conservative in our peer group. EOG’s passion for clean, simple financials has not changed. We have no goodwill on our balance sheet. We use successful efforts accounting, the more conservative exploration and production

accounting methodology. We have avoided the massive write-downs that the industry has recorded. External reviews of EOG’s reserves have been within 5 percent of internal estimates for 15 consecutive years, according to the independ- ent reserve engineering firm of DeGolyer and MacNaughton. In addition, rela- tive to the industry, EOG has a low percentage of proved undeveloped reserves on its books.
Also in 2002, EOG achieved full float stock liquidity after the last 10 per- cent block held by a former shareholder was successfully placed in the market. For the eighth consecutive year, EOG reduced its total outstanding share count, from 115.1 million at year-end 2001 to 114.4 million at year-end 2002. EOG has very strong debt coverage ratios, and compared with the industry, a conser- vative year-end debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 40.6 percent. Because we anticipated healthier prices in 2003, we purposely overspent cash flow in 2002. This sets up EOG for operational success in 2003 and beyond.
For the three-year period, 2000 through 2002, EOG’s stock ranked number 14 among the best performers of the Standard & Poor’s 500. For the five-year period 1998 through 2002, EOG posted a 24.6 percent return on equity. EOG’s focus on performance never wavers; our goal is to be a solid, responsible and profitable explo- ration and production company with a consistent long-term strategy.
The best is yet to be
The creative talents, energies and enthusiasm of our 1,000-employee workforce are in lockstep, right here, right now. With one of the most efficient and effective organic growth machines in the business, EOG will continue to play a leadership role in the industry, adding precious natural gas reserves efficiently and cost- effectively, year-in, year-out.
