Marathon Petroleum Corporation

Chairman's Letter
Fellow shareholders,

Thomas J. Usher

It is an honor for me to address you as chairman of the board of directors of Marathon Petroleum Corporation. After the successful spinoff from Marathon Oil Corporation in June 2011, MPC became a new company with a 124-year history. While justifiably proud of our accomplishments over the years, our focus remains on the great promise of our future.
The decision to spin off MPC enhanced the ability of the new company's efficient, wellrun refining, marketing and transportation assets to create shareholder value. That has been the focus of the MPC board of directors and its management team since the separation. As shareholders, you have demonstrated that you recognize our commitment and are enthusiastic about investing in our future success. As a board of directors, our confidence in MPC's ability to provide shareholder value is based on the company's experienced, committed management team and the ability of its people to make the most effective use of its world-class assets. We have acted on this confidence by taking early, prudent steps to share the company's success with you. After one quarter of operating as an independent company, we increased our quarterly dividend by 25 percent. After our second quarter of operations, we initiated a $2 billion share repurchase program and began evaluating strategic alternatives for our midstream assets to determine if yet more shareholder value can be unlocked. I have the privilege of chairing an MPC board of directors characterized by a combination of continuity and fresh perspectives; more than half the members of our board have served on the Marathon Oil Corporation board, and the new members bring a wealth of knowledge and insight to help create a strong and decisive board. We represent deep "During 2011, we saw MPC experience in a diverse array of economic sectors and industries, and as fellow shareholders, we are united in our abiding commitment to thrive under a superb team create shareholder value. During 2011, we saw MPC thrive under a superb team that continued operating the company creatively and efficiently, and we balanced careful investments with the return of capital to shareholders.

CEO's Letter
Fellow shareholders,

Gary R. Heminger

Marathon Petroleum Corporation's spinoff as a new company came at a historic time for our nation's energy industry. As MPC came into being at the midpoint of 2011, domestic and global factors came together to create extraordinary market opportunities. I am proud to report to you that the talent and assets we dedicated to these opportunities generated significant value for our shareholders in 2011.

President and Chief Executive Officer

After the successful execution of MPC's separation from Marathon Oil Corporation, we established a strong balance sheet and very quickly increased our quarterly dividend to reflect our commitment to return capital to our shareholders. We balanced this shareholder perspective with our need to ensure sufficient financial resources to fund operations and enable the company to pursue opportunities that will create future shareholder value. MPC's senior management team represents more than 350 years of combined experience with the company, and we put this collective wisdom to work in 2011 to deliver on our promise to create lasting value. One of the most telling measures of our success is that we again achieved the highest adjusted domestic operating income per barrel of crude oil throughput among our industry peers in 2011.
Balance

Our strong 2011 financial and operational performance was enhanced by our deliberate balance. First, we are balanced in terms of our geographic distribution. About half of our crude oil refining capacity is in the Midwest and the other half on the Gulf Coast, both of which afforded us unique advantages in 2011 in terms of sourcing crude oil and meeting market needs. Second, our crude slate in 2011 was balanced, with slightly over half being sour crude and slightly under half sweet crude. Third, we have a finely tuned, integrated system that balances six high-performing refineries, a diverse logistics system that links them all together and a retail presence that provides us with significant assured sales of our refining outputs. And finally, we also balanced the need to invest in our business with our goal of returning capital to our shareholders.
Strategic Growth

MPC's growth strategy is focused on leveraging our existing strengths, both operationally and geographically. We made great strides in the optimization of our processing capabilities, as the $2.2 billion Detroit Heavy Oil Upgrade Project (DHOUP) ended the year on budget and on schedule to be online by year-end 2012. We also have successfully grown our Garyville, La., refinery capacity through debottlenecking efforts. We have seen a steady increase in diesel exports since expanding the diesel production and export capacity of our Garyville refinery in 2009. Diesel exports in 2011 more than doubled 2010 volume. This is a market dynamic in which we expect to continue playing a significant role. Speedway's acquisition in May of 23 convenience stores in the Chicago area builds on our presence in the Midwest, brings our store count in the greater Chicago metropolitan market to almost 160 and takes advantage of four terminals we own in the area. At the same time, light product sales volume through the Marathon brand increased more than 4 percent in 2011, even as overall light product demand in these markets dropped.
Crude Oil Optimization

In 2011, we were successful in our efforts to optimize our crude slate to include lower-cost crude oil from a variety of sources. We also took steps in 2011 to ensure that MPC is the customer of choice for the new ­ and extremely promising ­ Utica shale oil in eastern Ohio. By year-end, we had installed a temporary crude oil truck unloading rack at our refinery in Canton, Ohio, to accommodate Utica production, and we anticipate increasing our

unloading capacity there as production from the Utica play rises. We already have substantial crude oil truck unloading capacity at our nearby Catlettsburg, Ky., refinery.
Strong Financial Position

MPC's prudent strategy has put the company in a strong financial position, with liquidity to fund our current operations and future growth opportunities, a debt-to-total-capital ratio of 26 percent, and strong cash flow relative to our debt at the end of 2011. The spinoff was accomplished with an investment-grade credit profile that we are committed to maintaining into the future.
Our Values Drive Success

While MPC's experienced workforce, refining system and logistics help drive our ability to create shareholder value, it is our resolute commitment to a strong set of values that enables us to consistently perform at the highest level. Our corporate values ­ health and safety, environmental stewardship, integrity, corporate citizenship and fostering an inclusive culture ­ underlie everything we do. Our values are behind our participation in voluntary programs, which in many areas exceed regulatory requirements for safe, environmentally sound operations. Just a few examples are the Responsible Care® program, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration Voluntary Protection Program and the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star program. We are 24,000 people who care about our shareholders, our work, our neighbors, our integrity and the land we call home. Each of these facets of our lives is as important as the other, and we strive to create shareholder value by ensuring they all measure up to the standards of our shareholders, of our regulators, of the communities in which we are privileged to do business, and of the markets we serve ­ the hundreds of millions of people who need affordable, reliable fuels every day.
A look ahead

I am proud of the noteworthy accomplishments MPC has achieved in the short time since we became an independent, publicly traded company. Our plans for 2012 and beyond are no less ambitious. In addition to completing the optimization of our crude oil processing capacities through DHOUP and debottlenecking at Garyville, we will continue seeking opportunities to drive shareholder value. Whether it's selective acquisitions that leverage our existing portfolio, increasing our sales volumes through Speedway and our Marathon brand or evaluating strategic options regarding our midstream assets, our focus is enhancing our value to you, the shareholder. This objective drives not just our strategic decision making, but also our interaction with shareholders. We made a commitment in 2011 to establish MPC as a company that listens to shareholders, and we delivered on that commitment. We made our management team available to investors routinely, listened to what you had to say, and implemented recommendations that we agreed would be in the best interests of the company and those who have invested in our future. We look forward to continuing that dialogue in 2012 and beyond. 2011 was an excellent year for MPC and its shareholders, and we are confident that performance is a prelude of what's to come. We appreciate your investment in MPC's future, and we look forward to continuing to share our success.

"We appreciate your investment in MPC's future, and we look forward to continuing to share our success."
