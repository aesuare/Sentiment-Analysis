 Letter to Our Shareholders
Strategy Evolution Drives Financial Results
During 2017, Barnes Group delivered strong revenue and adjusted earnings growth and made noteworthy progress on our transformational journey. We executed well on our strategy and delivered impressive financial results as we pursue our vision to be a global provider of engineered products and innovative solutions, generating superior value for our customers and our stakeholders, through our passionate and energized employees.
As we build on our Company’s strengths, which include market leadership with high-quality brands; an experienced management team; a culture built on values, teamwork, and community spirit; and a 160-year legacy of manufacturing expertise and innovation, we are differentiating the Company from our competition. Around the world, our 5,400 skilled and dedicated employees
are committed to achieving consistent and sustainable, profitable growth by fulfilling the four key pillars of our strategy:
• Build a World-class Company Focused on High Margin, High Growth Businesses
• Leverage the Barnes Enterprise System (“BES”) as a Significant Competitive Advantage • Expand and Protect Our Core Intellectual Property to Deliver Differentiated Solutions
• Effectively Allocate Capital to Drive Top Quartile Total Shareholder Return
We firmly believe that delivering on these core elements of our strategy will allow us to achieve our present goals and ensure our future success. Our solid execution of this strategy has provided for a 2017 total shareholder return of nearly 35% to our shareholders, surpassing that of the S&P 600 and Russell 2000 indices.
Solid Financial Performance & Investment in our Future
For 2017, strong financial performance was led by organic sales growth of 11% and an adjusted earnings per share(1) increase of 14%. With both our Industrial and Aerospace segments well positioned in favorable end markets, robust order intake propelled year-end backlog to over $1 billion, up 17% over the prior year-end.
We continued to generate good cash flow and conversion. Free cash flow,
our operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $145 million and our
“free cash flow to net income” conversion ratio, as adjusted, was a solid 93%,
even in light of higher working capital to support global growth and increased investment. During the year, we spent $59 million in capital expenditures, 23% higher than the prior year, about half of which targeted growth programs supporting our products and services with differentiated industrial technologies and capabilities.
At the same time, acquisitions remain a critical component of our growth strategy. In April, we acquired Gammaflux, a leading global supplier of high quality hot runner temperature and sequential valve gate control systems to the plastics industry. Gammaflux technology, when combined with our leading hot runner, complex mold, and sensor technologies, creates an unsurpassed offering to our customers in the plastic injection molding industry.
In addition, we returned over $70 million of capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Early in 2017, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8%, reflective of our improving financial performance and good cash generation, and we are proud to have paid a cash dividend to our stockholders on a continuous basis since 1934.

 Leveraging BES to Power Excellence
Our ability to deliver improved performance is integrally linked to the Barnes Enterprise System, or BES, and our strategic enablers
of Innovation and Talent Management. Each component is instrumental in supporting the Company’s continued transformation.
The Barnes Enterprise System has evolved from important tool-based processes and techniques to being our fully
integrated, operating system. Building on the significant progress made in terms of culture, alignment, and continuous improvement,
we are taking BES to the next level with an even stronger emphasis on excellence in everything we do. BES is about powering excellence
through clearly defined and fully integrated business processes. Achieving Commercial, Operational, and Financial Excellence allows us to build on
the principles of BES to achieve measurable results – both quantitative and qualitative – which are critical to successfully executing our strategy.
Commercial Excellence ensures that we get the proposal, the deal, and the product right the first time. Understanding our value, pricing, manufacturing processes and capacity, supply chain, and potential risks will allow us to maximize a given opportunity and limit our downside exposure while allowing us to achieve the best outcome for our customers and Barnes Group.
Operational Excellence allows us to continuously improve our systems to drive productivity and efficiencies in our business. Key elements of Operational Excellence focus on driving safety as a priority, all while delivering quality products and services on time to our customers, every day. Applying technologies such as automation, additive manufacturing, and smart-connected products will enable us to meet fast-changing market demands and customer needs as well as provide us with a competitive advantage today and in the future.
Financial Excellence is directly related to Operational and Commercial Excellence. All three elements are intrinsically connected to achieve the desired results. Ultimately, Financial Excellence is an outcome of every aspect of how we conduct business in our operations. By creating, implementing, and continuously improving robust business processes and systems, we will accomplish profitable growth across all of Barnes Group.
In the area of Innovation, we launched the new Global Innovation Forum (GIF), formally the Global Engineering and Technology Forum, to now include new customer-facing cross-functional representation. The mission of the GIF is to promote organic profitable growth by identifying and capitalizing on disruptive trends such as additive manufacturing and digitalization, expanding and protecting our global intellectual property infrastructure, and optimizing worldwide resources, both internal and external, to position the next generation of products and services for commercial success.
With Talent Management, substantial progress was made on systems and processes to attract, develop, and retain top talent with the skills necessary to accelerate Barnes Group’s performance to the next level. Such actions included enhancing the Company’s leadership development program, launching a mentoring pilot program, hosting numerous events to promote careers in manufacturing, expanding our apprenticeship program, and increasing community outreach and involvement across the enterprise.

 A Positive 2018 Outlook with 2020 Vision
As we exit 2017, we feel very positive about the upcoming year and look forward to delivering solid returns to our shareholders. We remain committed to making the necessary investments to strengthen our global competitive position and deliver exceptional value to our customers through
our intellectual property-based capabilities and innovative solutions. We are enthusiastic about the opportunities we see for future growth, and our businesses are well-positioned to further benefit from a strong economy.
During our Company’s inaugural investor day in September, we introduced our 2020 financial targets: organic sales growth CAGR of 4% to 6%, operating margins between 18% to 19%, EPS CAGR in the double digits, and return on invested capital of approximately 10%. Our management team is collectively energized about driving our vision
and strategy; and while we’ve made tremendous progress to date, we believe we’re only in the early stages of this journey. We thank all of our employees for their hard work, support, and dedication to Barnes Group. Not only have we achieved our current success through their contributions, but we look to them to attain our 2020 goals. Our long-term excellence will depend on our ability to work as One Team, One Company, embracing the change required to shape Barnes Group for the future.
On behalf of our Board of Directors and employees, we extend our sincere appreciation to our customers, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate for their continued confidence and trust in Barnes Group.
