Creating sustainable shareholder value
 Dear Shareholders:
I am proud of the progress our team has made to transform Newmont in my first year as President and Chief Executive Officer. We controlled what we could control, and despite a significant drop in gold price, better positioned the business to deliver sustainable shareholder value in the years ahead. Early in 2013, we established
six priorities to drive a stronger focus on value Ð and ended the year having met or exceeded our commitments:
To improve safety, efficiency and costs at our existing operations, we:
- Lowered our consolidated spending1 by nearly $1 billion in 2013 alone, far exceeding our target to achieve cost savings and efficiency improvements of between $500 million and $750 million over a three-year horizon
- Reduced gold all-in sustaining costs per ounce by six percent compared to 20122
- Achieved the best safety performance in Newmont history, reducing injury rates by 28 percent compared to 2012; however, this performance was marred by the loss of our colleague Corey Vasquez, who suffered a fatal injury
- Adjusted price assumptions for reserves and impairments to $1,300 per ounce to protect the long-term value of our assets; and to $1,200 per ounce for our business plan to maintain financial discipline
To restrict capital investment to assets and projects that generate strong returns, we:
- Reduced sustaining capital by $700 million and established a more disciplined approach to screening investments based on their value, longevity, cost position and risk profile
- Built two new profitable operations Ð Akyem in Ghana and Phoenix Copper Leach in Nevada Ð safely, on time and on budget

 - Took steps to optimize our exploration and project portfolio including Merian in Suriname, Long Canyon in Nevada, Ahafo expansions in Ghana, and Conga in Peru
- Delivered five million ounces of quality gold reserves, and increased our average reserve grade by seven percent
To deliver significant cash flow through profitable production, we:
- Generated $1.6 billion in operating cash flow,3 and ended the year with $1.6 billion in cash
- Met the top end of our gold production guidance of 5.1 million attributable ounces, and delivered a step-change in productivity at Tanami
To allocate capital to shareholder returns and prudent growth projects while maintaining a strong balance sheet, we:
- Upheld our capital allocation priorities, which are to maintain financial flexibility, invest in our top development prospects, and return capital to shareholders
- Divested non-core assets generating nearly $600 million in cash
To continue giving investors leverage to gold price through our gold price-linked dividend, we:
- Delivered adjusted net income4 of $695 million or $1.40 per basic share, including a negative impact of $1.11 per share related to impairments of stockpiles and ore on leach pads
- Maintained our gold price-linked dividend while modifying our policy; we will continue paying a dividend at gold prices above $1,200 per ounce, with significant increases as prices rise
 ÒOur team delivered $1 billion in cost and efficiency improvements in 2013, and we will apply the same expertise and discipline to realize at least another $600 million to $700 million in savings from 2014 to 2016.Ó
To maintain or gain the trust and support of our host governments and communities, we:
- Improved social acceptance for the Conga project by delivering on our commitment to significantly improve year-round access to clean water in Cajamarca, Peru
- Secured a Mineral Agreement with the government of Suriname, a prerequisite to developing the Merian project

 We also added recognized industry leaders to our executive team; streamlined administrative staffing levels by nearly 30 percent; and reconfigured our operating model to sharpen our focus on value over volume. This positive momentum will continue in the form of lower costs, improved liquidity and enhanced free cash flow in the years ahead.
Future focus
Newmont remains the premier U.S.-based gold mining company. We have a strong asset portfolio with 70 percent of our production derived from Australia, New Zealand and the United States; and 90 percent of our revenue derived from gold. We expect
to deliver average annual production of about five million ounces of gold over the next three years, with gold production rising by about five percent from 2014 to 2015 and 2016.5
Our team delivered $1 billion in cost and efficiency improvements in 2013, and we will apply the same expertise and discipline to realize at least another $600 million to $700 million in savings from 2014 to 2016. We expect to deliver two-thirds of these savings through operating cost and efficiency improvements, and the remaining third through better recovery and throughput. Savings will more than offset the effects of inflation and rising input costs.
Maintaining an investment grade balance sheet and delivering sustainable value to shareholders remain top priorities. We recently secured commitments to restructure our debt, and revised our dividend policy to strengthen our financial flexibility while giving investors exposure to rising gold price. Our work to divest assets that no longer fit our strategy to operate a portfolio of long-life, low-cost gold and copper assets will also continue.
 ÒThis positive momentum will continue in the form of lower costs, improved liquidity and enhanced free cash flow in the years ahead.Ó
We have made strong progress in optimizing our project portfolio. Our most prospective projects could generate more than 1.5 million ounces of gold annually at competitive costs. The most advanced is the Merian project in Suriname and we will decide
whether to proceed with development in the second quarter of 2014. This project is value-accretive, and gives us a foothold in the highly prospective Guiana Shield.

 In 2015, we will decide whether to proceed with developing Long Canyon and two expansion projects in Ghana. The Ahafo Mill expansion would optimize throughput and help counter the impact of lower grade ore we are currently mining, and the Subika underground mine would improve the ore grade we send through the mill.
While we have reduced our budget, we continue to see exploration as one of our core capabilities. In fact, of forecasted 2014 production, 75 percent was discovered by Newmont geologists. Our strategy is to focus on only our best opportunities and we are advancing exceptionally high grade finds in Nevada, Australia, Ghana and Peru, all near our existing operations. These prospects are expected to add higher grade material to our inventory in 2014.
Our vision for Newmont is to lead the gold sector in creating value for shareholders. We will continue to build a stronger business by delivering industry leading cost and efficiency improvements along with stable production; and by building a stronger asset portfolio through our world class project and exploration portfolio.
I am excited about our continuing work to maximize value for shareholders, and to position the business to capture the benefits of economic recovery and demand growth in the longer term. Thank you for investing in Newmont, and for your continued interest and support.
Sincerely,
Gary J. Goldberg
President and Chief Executive Officer
