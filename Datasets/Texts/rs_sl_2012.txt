 Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. 2012 Annual Report 09
   To Our
RELIANCE
STEEL & ALUMINUM CO. Shareholders:
We were satisfied with our overall performance in 2012, both financially and operationally. The year began with a robust market for metals; however, due to continued economic and political uncertainty along with pressure on pricing, demand waned as the year progressed. Still, our full year results reflected solid growth over 2011: net income increased 17.4% to $403.5 million, and earnings per diluted share increased 16.4% to $5.33. Although we didn’t break any records, we did post the second highest revenue and the third highest earnings per share in Reliance’s history.
Based on MSCI data, Reliance continued to surpass the broader metals service center industry, which reported total steel tons shipped in the U.S. increased 1.3% for the full year of 2012. Our tons sold increased 5.4% for the year, reflecting a slow but continuing recovery in end demand, as well as the incremental sales from our acquisitions and strategic asset purchases. On a same-store sales basis, total tons sold in 2012 were up 3.4%. Reliance’s outperformance of the metals service center industry reflects our consistent strategy of growth by acquisition, investment in existing capabilities, continuous operational improvement, and commitment to safety, employee excellence, and customer service.
Despite the downward trend in metals pricing in 2012 over 2011, our increased exposure
to higher-growth industries helped to somewhat offset the pressure on our average selling prices, because the specialty products and processes required in these industries command higher selling prices. Commercial aerospace build rates continue to rise, and oil and natural gas continue to be among our strongest market segments.
In 2012, we continued our growth in specialty products and in higher-growth end markets. In February, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Diamond Manufacturing Company, we acquired McKey Perforating Co., Inc. with locations in Berlin, Wisconsin and Manchester, Tennessee. McKey provides a full range of metal perforating and fabrication services.

In April we acquired National Specialty Alloys, LLC, a global specialty alloy processor and distributor of premium stainless steel and nickel alloy bars and shapes, headquartered in Houston, Texas, with additional locations in Anaheim, California, Buford, Georgia and Tulsa, Oklahoma.
In October we completed the acquisitions of Sunbelt Steel Texas, LLC and GH Metal Solutions, Inc. Sunbelt is a value-added distributor of special alloy steel bar and heavy-wall tubing products to the oil and gas industry. Sunbelt is headquartered in Houston, Texas with an additional location in Lafayette, Louisiana. GH Metal Solutions was acquired through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Feralloy Corporation, and is a value-added processor and fabricator of carbon steel products located in Fort Payne, Alabama.
Also in 2012 we completed two strategic asset purchases. Worthington Steel’s Vonore, Tennessee plant now operates as a Precision Strip, Inc. location, and through our newly- formed subsidiary Bralco Metals (Australia) Pty Ltd, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Airport Metals (Australia) Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Samuel Son & Co., Limited based in Melbourne. In total, these six acquisitions added $115 million to Reliance’s 2012 sales.
On February 6, 2013, we were very pleased to announce a definitive agreement to acquire Metals USA Holdings Corp., in an approximately $1.2 billion all-cash transaction. This will
be our largest acquisition to date, adding 48 service center locations across the U.S. Upon completion of this immediately accretive transaction, Reliance’s annual sales will be upwards of $10 billion. We expect to close in the second quarter of 2013. Even with this acquisition, Reliance will only hold 7–8% of the metals service center market (in the U.S.). It’s still a highly fragmented industry, meaning there is a lot of room for growth. We’re going to continue to keep our eyes open for acquisitions that increase our diversification in products, end markets and geography.

In addition to our growth strategy, we’re continuing to invest in areas in which we have had a longstanding presence. Heavy industries, such as mining equipment, barge and tank manufacturers, transmission towers, and rail cars, remain strong. While agricultural equipment slowed somewhat in the latter part of 2012—primarily due to the summer drought—forecasts predict solid improvement in 2013. The automotive market, supported by our toll processing businesses in the U.S. and Mexico, is performing extremely well and the future looks bright, while non-residential construction is improving but remains well below peak 2006 levels.
Whatever the market condition, one of Reliance’s primary goals is to continue to maintain
a strong balance sheet. This gives us the strength and flexibility not only to adapt to any changes, but to leverage any and all opportunities that may arise, whether they be internal investments or growth through acquisitions. Our 2012 cash flow from operations was over $600 million, which helped to fund our capital expenditures of $214 million, our highest to date. This amount includes the expansion of our processing capabilities and geographic coverage as well as the purchase of six facilities that we previously leased, which will reduce our expenses.
Concurrent with our growth strategies, we have consistently returned capital to shareholders. On February 19, 2013, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per share of common stock—an increase of 20% over the previous quarterly dividend that was increased 67% in July 2012. We have paid regular quarterly dividends for 53 consecutive years. Reliance has increased our dividend 19 times, and has also achieved a compound growth rate of over 18% in stock value, since our 1994 IPO through December 2012.

In July, we welcomed Sarah J. (“Sally”) Anderson as our newest independent director. Sally brings over 25 years of experience as a partner in Ernst & Young LLP’s Assurance and Advisory Services. She sits on the Audit Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee.
In 2014 we will commemorate Reliance’s 75th anniversary as well as 20 years as a public company. It’s going to be a milestone year. In anticipation of this momentous occasion, we unveiled an updated Reliance logo and vision statement in early 2013. The new vision statement opens by saying, “Our history is the key to writing the story of our future.” Not only are we reflecting and remembering from where and how far we’ve come, we’re pursuing our future with renewed passion and energy and with the honesty, integrity, humility and compassion that has, and will continue, to define us. We are excited about what lies ahead in 2013 and we thank you, our shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers, for your continued support.
