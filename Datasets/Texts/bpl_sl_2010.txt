DEAR VALUED UNITHOLDERS

150 100 50 0

2010 was a year of transformation. We announced our largest acquisition to date, entered the international market and completed the merger of Buckeye Partners, L.P. and Buckeye GP Holdings L.P. We advanced the quality and integrity of our operations 400 and enhanced our entrepreneurial culture. All of this was accomplished while we continued to increase distributions to 350 1.2 unitholders and our Adjusted EBITDA, the primary measures of our performance.
300 1.0 The achievements of 2010 are the result of strategies our management team began implementing 250 in 2007. Just a few short years ago, we saw a company with great assets, talented people, 0.8 200 and a lot of opportunity to grow in size and deliver superior returns to unitholders. Our goals included becoming a best-in-class asset manager, building a commercial culture that would 150 0.6 drive growth, and expanding our asset base by adding a wider range of services across a 100 0.4 today. Quite simply, our growing geographic footprint. That vision continues to guide Buckeye job has been to unlock the potential of an enterprise that is now 12550 years old.

The majority of Buckeye-owned and operated liquid petroleum products pipelines and storage terminals are in the Northeast and Midwestern United States. We continue to look to diversify our assets  geographically. For example, we recently purchased premier storage terminals in Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.

ideas has increased. In the fourth quarter of 2010 alone, $4.5 million worth of ideas were submitted. To build on the momentum behind the Gain Sharing Program, we have made significant investments to equip our employees with the skills needed to generate valuable business ideas. Through our Student of the Business Program, both internal and external subject matter experts meet with team members representing various parts of the business to give them a more well-rounded view of Buckeye's operations and what makes our company succeed. The result is a workforce that is increasingly knowledgeable about our business and objectives, and equipped and energized to offer strategies for achieving those objectives.

Commitment to Safety
Not only was 2010 a good year at Buckeye in terms of operations, asset growth, and commercial performance, but we achieved these successes while maintaining our unyielding commitment to being a safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible operator. Our proactive approach toward mitigating safety risks led to a year-over-year reduction in both recordable injuries and vehicle accidents. Continuous improvement in our safety initiatives is a top priority at Buckeye. To support that goal, we hold weekly safety calls as well as quarterly safety meetings attended by employees across all areas of the company including field and central office personnel. In addition to the many local emergency response drills we hold across our footprint, we also completed an extensive company-wide emergency response summit in the fourth quarter as part of our continuous efforts to ensure we will be prepared should Buckeye experience an unforeseen event.

Expanding Our Footprint
Buckeye is dedicated to continuing to grow our footprint through acquisitions and organic growth projects. In the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of liquid products terminals in Opelousas, Louisiana and Yabucoa, Puerto Rico. The Yabucoa, Puerto Rico terminal has 4.6 million barrels of storage capacity, increasing our total storage capacity to over 31.8 million barrels at the end of 2010. This facility supplies liquid products to a strong local market and provides Buckeye with additional regional growth opportunities. The Opelousas terminal is an example of our commitment to grow our domestic footprint in ways that further link our business segments and provide more strategic options to our customers. In this case, the Opelousas terminal creates synergies between our Terminalling & Storage business segment, which operates the terminal, and our Development & Logistics business segment, which currently operates, maintains, and constructs pipelines and terminals for third parties and has a strong presence in the Gulf Coast region.

The most important element of our strategy, and the key to unlocking the value of our assets, is our people. Our teams are empowered and responsive.

In December 2010, we reached an agreement to acquire Bahamas Oil Refining Company International, or BORCO, and its world-class marine terminal located in Freeport, Bahamas. We acquired 80 percent of BORCO from affiliates of FRC Founders Corporation and the remaining 20 percent from affiliates of Royal Vopak in the first quarter of 2011 for total consideration of $1.7 billion. BORCO is a world-class marine storage facility strategically located only 80 miles from the coast of Florida, and 920 miles from New York Harbor. BORCO has 21.6 million barrels of storage capacity and acts as a premier global logistics hub.  The facility currently is fully contracted under three- to five-year agreements with a top-tier customer base and has substantial expansion opportunities. We see this acquisition as a strategic step toward our goal of continued geographic and product diversification. As east coast refining capacity declines over time, demand for refined product imports to the United States will increase. We have already identified near term expansion opportunities that will allow BORCO to take advantage of that growing demand. Additional unused land is available at the facility for future development with potential to double the existing storage capacity. BORCO also will help us realize synergies with Buckeye's legacy assets and other new assets, such as the Puerto Rico terminal. We already have seen the benefits of Buckeye's best practices extended into these new operations. We are well along the path toward full integration and look forward to continuing to leverage these new capabilities.

include the addition of automation systems, rail lines, storage tanks, biodiesel and ethanol blending facilities, loading racks, and gas storage injection and withdrawal wells. The capital growth opportunities we pursue are based on the unique characteristics and opportunities each asset presents. Many of these projects were identified and championed as part of our Gain Sharing Program. As a result of ongoing analysis of market opportunities and employee ideas in 2010, we are reviewing three times the number of growth opportunities we reviewed in 2008.

Competitive Structure
The completion of the merger of Buckeye Partners, L.P. with the owner of its general partner, Buckeye GP Holdings L.P., in November of 2010 was a significant event. Combining these entities lowers our cost of capital and enhances our ability to compete successfully for high growth acquisition opportunities and expansion projects. Importantly, we also believe the merger increases the potential for accelerated distribution growth at Buckeye.

Operations Review
Below is a summary of our operating highlights for 2010.*  Pipeline Operations oP  ipeline Operations Adjusted EBITDA in 2010 totaled $235.4 million compared to $229.6 million the year before. Although volumes for the full year essentially were flat, volumes on our pipelines were up 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter compared to 2009, reflecting continued strength in distillates and positive trends in gasoline and jet fuel. Diesel fuel remained the strongest performer with year-over-year growth of 11.7 percent in 2010. oA  s a result of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) recent decision regarding the methodology for pipeline tariff rate increases, we expect to see our FERC pipeline tariff rates increase approximately 6.9 percent in July of 2011.  Terminalling & Storage oT  erminalling & Storage finished the year with Adjusted EBIDTA of $106.4 million compared to $72.6 million in 2009. Terminalling volumes totaled 564.3 thousand barrels per day in 2010, compared to 471.9 thousand barrels per day

Enhancing Legacy Assets
Although we continue to actively look for appropriate acquisition opportunities, we are taking a balanced approach to growth by also identifying investments that enhance our legacy assets. As part of our drive to be best-in-class, we have a very active growth capital program focused on increasing volumes and adding to the services we provide to our customers. We regularly invest in our legacy assets by increasing capacity, capabilities, and functions that expand our role within the supply chain. Projects completed in 2010 and planned for 2011

We see this acquisition (BORCO) as a strategic step toward our goal of continued geographic and product diversification.

in 2009, an increase of nearly 20 percent. With the BORCO acquisition completed, Buckeye now has 53 million barrels of storage capacity. oT  he business integrations of the BORCO, Yabucoa, and Opelousas terminals into the Buckeye organization are advancing as planned. The employees at these facilities embrace a best-in-class culture and exemplify best practice methods in both safety and operational excellence. We look forward to working with these teams to identify continuous improvement opportunities.  Natural Gas Storage oN  atural Gas Storage Adjusted EBITDA in 2010 was $29.8 million compared to $42.0 million in 2009, as this segment continued to be impacted by lower natural gas prices, lower price volatility, and suppressed lease rates. As a result, we are focusing our efforts on optimizing the facility's capacity and developing customer relationships. These efforts have yielded significant increases in our working capacity over the last 18 months. Aggregate working capacity now exceeds 29 billion cubic feet. We are continuing to pursue additional optimization opportunities and expect to further increase working capacity this year. These growth initiatives will help position this segment to benefit significantly from future improvements in market conditions.  Energy Services oE  nergy Services Adjusted EBITDA was $5.9 million for 2010 compared to $19.3 million in 2009. BES's Adjusted EBITDA was adversely impacted by limited inventory optimization opportunities, excess supply early in the year, and weaker basis differentials in New York Harbor in the fourth quarter. Product sales volumes for the year exceeded 1.1 billion gallons. Most importantly, the volumes that BES moved across our pipeline and terminal systems produced an additional $36 million in Adjusted EBITDA for the overall enterprise, up over 50 percent from the prior year.

 Development & Logistics oD  evelopment & Logistics generated $5.2 million of Adjusted EBITDA in 2010 compared to $6.7 million in 2009. The segment continues to identify off-system development opportunities that will provide both geographic diversity and business platform expansion, allowing us to continue to find new ways to enhance Buckeye's growth. BDL has been actively involved in our recent terminal acquisitions as well as in identifying and evaluating multiple organic growth opportunities. Careful and complete integration of recently acquired assets is a top priority for 2011. At the same time, we will continue to seek opportunities to enhance Buckeye's services to our customers and meet their logistical requirements for liquid petroleum products while expanding our geographic footprint. We also will continue to pursue growth opportunities that deliver value to unitholders and complement our existing asset portfolio and organizational culture. We are looking forward to what I believe will be another good year for Buckeye.
