TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
2009 marked Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.’s 70th year as a metals service center company and our 15th year as a
public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We feel 2009 was the most difficult
operating environment that our company has ever experienced. Because of this, we focused on
maximizing cash flow through stringent working capital management, paying down debt, reducing expenses and maintaining profitability. We generated record cash flow from operations of $943 million and paid down about $830 million of debt. Our net debt-to-total capital ratio was only 25.6% at December 31, 2009, down from 41.4%
at December 31, 2008. We also reduced our same-store operating expenses by $248 million, or 22%, in 2009.
We begin 2010 a stronger and leaner company ready to take advantage of attractive business opportunities. We are structured to operate profitably at low business levels and are well positioned for the improvement in business conditions whenever and wherever that occurs. We continue to believe that our product, customer and geographic diversification play an important role in our continued success.
We once again demonstrated our ability to outperform our peers in even the most challenging of operating environments. For 2009, net income was $148.2 million, compared with record net income of $482.8 million for 2008. Earnings per diluted share were $2.01 for 2009, compared with record

Reliance’s operations have changed significantly over the past 70 years. Yet many of the core values of the early management team remain at the center of Reliance and its operating philosophy.

is indeed the premier company in the metals service center industry.

   earnings of $6.56 per diluted share for 2008. Sales for 2009 were $5.32 billion, down 39% from our record 2008 sales of $8.72 billion. Our gross profit margin was 26.3% of sales for 2009, compared with 24.8%
for 2008. Our 2009 cost of sales included a LIFO credit, or income, of $305.0 million, compared to a LIFO
charge, or expense, of $109.2 million in 2008.
We faced many challenges in 2009, the extent and severity of which we had never seen before. With Reliance’s keep-it-simple approach, we focused on what we could control. We reduced our inventories due to the large and rapid fall off in demand and historically large mill price reductions for carbon steel products – 56% of our 2009 sales.
Significant and rapid price and demand declines began in the 2008 fourth quarter and continued through the 2009 first half. With both demand and pricing falling significantly during the first half of the year, our gross profit and operating margins dropped significantly. Our gross profit margins initially began to improve in the 2009 third quarter due to some mill price increases and our inventory costs being better aligned with current replacement cost.
We began to aggressively reduce our operating expenses beginning in the 2008 fourth quarter. Unfortunately, the majority of the reductions were in personnel, as about 60% of our operating expenses are personnel related. Due to the depressed business levels, we reduced our workforce by about 2,500, or 22%.

Based on beginning of the year equity amounts, except for 2006, which was adjusted for $360.5 million of common stock and stock options issued to fund our April 3, 2006 acquisition.
Our management teams did an outstanding job managing our working capital, producing record cash
flow and paying down a significant amount of debt. We only had $115 million outstanding on our $1.1
billion credit facility at the end of 2009 and $147.1 million of scheduled debt maturities through November 2012. In September 2009 we amended our credit facility mainly to provide relief under our interest
coverage ratio covenant and extended $1.02 billion of our commitments for an additional year, through November 2012. We also maintained our investment grade credit rating. Because of the quick and effective actions of our managers in 2009, we were able to post profits for 2009 when many other companies in our industry could not.
We are very proud of improving our safety performance in 2009. Keeping our employees safe is a key priority at Reliance. We believe that our employees deserve a safe working environment and we also believe that good safety practices lead to improved quality, efficiency and morale.
We do not expect to see many acquisition opportunities that meet our highly selective criteria until business conditions improve further for our industry. We do, however, expect to continue to grow the Company through internal activities that enhance our product, geographic and customer diversity. Our 2010 capital expenditure budget is $140 million and includes investments in new and enhanced facilities and equipment.
Demand in the 2010 first quarter has improved over the second half of 2009. We expect that demand will continue to recover slowly throughout the year.

 We have seen improvement in the electronics, semiconductor, energy, oil and gas, auto and appliance markets. Certain manufacturing and capital goods activity also
seems somewhat improved and our aerospace business should remain stable. Our largest end market, non-residential construction, is our major area of weakness.
We believe the challenging operating environment of 2009 has created additional opportunities for Reliance. Just-in-time inventory management fits our operating model and could increase our market share as other service centers fail to service small quantity orders with short lead times as well as we do. Customers may buy from Reliance since some of our competitors do not have the inventory in stock or customers may question the financial stability of their suppliers. When demand does improve, our competitors will need more working capital and may have limited credit available to them; that may also lead to other business or acquisition opportunities for us. With Reliance’s strong capital structure, we are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.
On February 17, 2010, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.10 per share of common stock. The Company has paid regular quarterly dividend payments for 50 consecutive years, increasing its regular dividend 15 times, amounting to over 1,700% since our 1994 IPO. Since our IPO on September 16, 1994, Reliance’s revenues have grown from $447 million in 1994 to $5.32 billion in 2009. Additionally, our stock price has grown at a compound annual rate in excess of 18% since our 1994 IPO.

  RELIANCE HAS BEEN AN INNOVATOR SINCE 1939
In the early years, Reliance was a full-line distributor of steel and aluminum, operating a single metals service center
in Los Angeles, California. In the 1950’s the Company automated materials handling operations and began to
provide processing services to meet customers’ requirements. In the 1960’s, Reliance started acquiring other companies to establish additional service centers and expanded into other geographic areas. A key feature of the Company’s growth pattern was to purchase existing service centers and develop them into leading metals service centers. The Company has continued that expansion strategy and has completed 45 acquisitions since
its IPO in 1994. In the mid-1970’s, the Company began to establish specialty metals service centers stocked with only selected metals.
Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.’s decentralized management style, operational structure and geographically diverse facilities have created an entrepreneurial environment that continues to contribute significantly to its success. Reliance focuses on small order sizes with quick turn around. This requires decision making as well as operating assets to be close to the customers. This proximity, along with superior customer service and numerous products, distinguishes Reliance from the competition.
By consistently executing these strategies over the past 70 years, Reliance has grown from a privately-held, metals service center company with a single location in Los Angeles, to a Fortune 300 and New York Stock Exchange publicly-held company with more than 200 locations in North America and eight foreign countries.
From its early days, Reliance has been an innovator in pioneering product lines, material handling and processing methods.
