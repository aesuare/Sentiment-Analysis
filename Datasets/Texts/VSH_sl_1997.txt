 New Acquisitions Create Opportunities for Growth
 Financial Highlights
 To Our Stockholders, Employees, Customers and Vendors:
 During the last twelve months, Vishay entered the $14 billion discrete semiconductor (active) components market with two significant acquisitions. Discrete semiconductor (active) components complement our worldwide position in our tradi- tional business, the passive components market. Vishay began its penetration of the semiconductor components business with its July 1997 acquisition of 65 percent of Lite-On Power Semiconductor Corporation (LPSC) of Taiwan, for a purchase price of $130,000,000 and stock appreciation rights. LPSC is a joint venture between Vishay (65%) and Lite-On Group of Taiwan (35%).
LPSC manufactures diodes and transistors, which are discrete semiconductor (active) compo- nents. They convert electrical currents from AC to DC, switch and amplify currents and are used in many electronic circuits. LPSC’s manufacturing plants are located in Taipei, Taiwan; Shanghai, China; and Lee’s Summit, Missouri, USA. LPSC also owns a 40 percent interest in Diodes, Inc. (AMEX: DIO) a supplier of discrete semiconductor (active) devices located in Westlake, California. Sales of LPSC for the year ended December 31, 1997 were $76,040,000, a 41 percent increase over 1996. The operations of LPSC were consolidated into Vishay’s 1997 operations effective July 1, 1997.
In March 1998, Vishay solidified its position in the discrete semiconductor (active) area with its acquisition of the semiconductor business unit of TEMIC TELEFUNKEN microelectronics
GmbH of Heilbronn, Germany, and 80.4 percent of Siliconix (NASDAQ: SILI), a TEMIC subsidiary located in Santa Clara, California. Vishay paid approxi- mately $500 million to TEMIC’s parent company Daimler-Benz (NYSE: DAI) for the integrated circuits (IC) business and the discrete components business. Sales of the semiconductor business unit of TEMIC Semicon- ductor for calendar 1997 were approximately $850,000,000. Following the closing of that transaction, Vishay sold most of the IC business, which had annual sales of approximately $300,000,000, to Atmel Corporation (NASDAQ: ATML) and others for $140,000,000.
The net cost to Vishay for the discrete semiconductor (active) division, whose sales are approxi- mately $550,000,000, was therefore $360,000,000. The discrete active products consist of many types of diodes, transistors and optoelec- tronic devices. In addition to the discrete active division, Vishay retained two integrated circuit product lines, the infrared commu- nication devices (IRDC) and the Power ICs.
Applications for these products include the computer, multimedia and telecommunica- tions markets, as well as the automobile, home entertainment and industrial electronics markets. We are especially excited about the Power MOS products of Siliconix and the IRDC products of Telefunken. These products hold the leading position in the market. Siliconix’ Trench Power MOS is the product of choice for portable telephones and laptop computers, while the IRDC module enables data to be exchanged without cable connection between computers,

printers, plotters and portable telephones, using infrared light.
With these acquisitions Vishay has strategically extended its market position to become the manufacturer of the broadest line of discrete electronic components worldwide. We can now provide our customers with a single manufacturing source for essen- tially all passive and discrete semiconductor (active) components as well as some products in the IC area. We believe these acquisitions create a great opportunity for the financial and technological growth of Vishay.
Sales for the year ended December 31, 1997 were $1,125,219,000 compared to $1,097,979,000 in the previous year. Sales for the year ended December 31, 1997 were affected negatively by $55,424,000 due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.
Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 1997 were $53,302,000 or $0.83 per share (after special charges of $27,692,000 or $0.43 per share). Net earnings before special charges were $80,994,000 or $1.26 per share. Net earnings for the previous year were $52,616,000 or $0.82 per share (after a restructuring charge of $38,030,000 or $0.41 per share). Pretax earnings exclusive of special charges were $112,843,000 compared to $108,387,000 for the previous year.

To further strengthen our operations we announced in March 1998 the promotion of Dr. Gerald Paul to the position of president of Vishay. Dr. Paul will add the role of president to his current duties as chief operating officer and will continue to report to me.
The markets and customers for passive and discrete semicon- ductor (active) components are virtually identical, which means that the sales networks are already in place to reach the electronics original equipment manufacturers with one source for their discrete components. That fits right in with today’s purchasing patterns, as manufacturers and distributors strive to narrow their supplier base.
Vishay is looking ahead with confidence to expansion through new products, acquisitions and market penetration worldwide.
As always, we are extremely grateful to our employees world- wide for their loyalty, skill and energy, which have contributed significantly to our growth. We value the relationships we have with our employees, stockholders, customers and vendors. We salute you and look forward to a prosper- ous 1998.
Sincerely,

turing of our passive components business, resulting in plans for further transfer of certain opera- tions to low-cost countries at an estimated cost of approximately $12,000,000. Once these restructur- ing plans are fully implemented, we expect annual savings of $10,000,000 going forward as a result of these transfers. Other charges included inventory write- offs of $5,576,000 and the record- ing of a $10,000,000 tax expense for various tax uncertainties. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $5,295,000 for an unrealized noncash loss on a forward-exchange contract related to the TEMIC acquisitions. None of these charges have a cash effect on the ongoing operations of Vishay.
Gross profits for the year ended December 31, 1997 were 23.7 percent of sales as compared to 24.8 percent in the prior year. The gross profits were negatively affected by a difficult pricing environment and the fourth quarter 1997 restructuring program, which included $5,576,000 in inventory write-offs. Exclusive of those write-offs, the gross profit, as a percentage of sales, would have been 24.2 percent for the year ended December 31, 1997.
ber 31, 1997 was 0.36 compared to 0.24 at December 31, 1996. For the year ended
December 31, 1997, the Company’s cash flows from operations were $175,913,000 compared to $122,186,000, a 44 percent increase over the prior year. The increase in cash flows from operations is primarily due to a decrease in inventories in 1997 compared to an increase in invento- ries in 1996. Purchases of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 1997 were $75,870,000 as compared to $123,984,000 in the prior year.
Looking Ahead
During the past year, we have taken significant steps to strengthen the Company and grow it to become a worldwide leader in passive and discrete semiconductor (active) components with annual sales which will approach $2 billion in the future. We believe Vishay will benefit from the synergies created by the combina- tion of the manufacturing, selling and administration of the newly acquired entities. Additionally, Vishay will be able to leverage its purchasing power for materials used in the manufacturing process.
