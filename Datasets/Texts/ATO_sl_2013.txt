To Our Shareholders
By all accounts, Atmos Energy's 2013 fiscal year was outstanding, and its prospects for future growth and prosperity are excellent.
Fiscal 2013 Highlights $2.64 earnings per diluted share, an 11% increase over fiscal 2012 $1.40 per share annual dividend 23% total shareholder return $845.0 million in capital expenditures $122.3 million annual operating income increase from rate activities Georgia distribution assets sold for $153 million Reduced weighted average cost of long-term debt to 6.23% Standard & Poor's credit rating upgrade to A-

Earnings per diluted share went up 27 cents over fiscal 2012 results to $2.64. Consolidated net income rose 12 percent, year over year, to $243.2 million, marking our 11th consecutive year of increased earnings.  Return on average shareholders' equity was 9.7 percent, and total shareholder return was 23 percent.  Shareholders received annual dividends per share of $1.40. In November 2013, the board of directors raised the dividend by 8 cents a share, or 5.7 percent, to an annual indicated rate of $1.48 in fiscal 2014. Taking into account the effects of the company's mergers and acquisitions, our dividend has increased every year for the past 30 years.  Our results came from successfully executing our strategy of investing in our natural gas distribution system and seeking recovery of, and earnings on, such investments as soon as possible. We received approvals during fiscal 2013 for $122.3 million in annualized operating income increases as a result of rate filings and the effects of efficient rate mechanisms.  We also recorded a net-of-tax gain of $5.3 million, or 6 cents per diluted share,

President and Chief Executive Officer from the sale of our natural gas distribution assets in Georgia. The sale proceeds of $153 million were redeployed to fund growth opportunities in the remaining jurisdictions the company serves. By selling those assets, we streamlined our regulated operations to eight states and became more geographically efficient.  Regulated operations provided 95 percent of fiscal 2013 consolidated net income, with natural gas distribution contributing 67 percent and regulated transportation and storage providing 28 percent.

Solid Financial Foundation

n Natural Gas Distribution n Regulated Transmission and Storage Our rate base of regulated assets is projected to grow to between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion by the end of fiscal 2018. Our continuing investments in infrastructure improvements will be the primary driver for the growth in our future earnings.

Atmos Energy's solid financial foundation is reflected by its strong balance sheet. At fiscal year-end on September 30, 2013, our debt capitalization ratio was 52.2 percent, compared with 51.7 percent at September 30, 2012. At yearend, available liquidity of approximately $715 million was sufficient to meet our anticipated needs.  In January 2013, we reduced the weighted average cost of our long-term debt to 6.23 percent when we issued $500 million of 4.15 percent 30-year

 Nonregulated operations contributed the remaining 5 percent of net income in fiscal 2013. The segment's $11 million of earnings reflected strong performance from focusing on its core delivered-gas business. Our gas marketing business continues to score high ratings in customer satisfaction and to maintain the loyalty of our long-time gas customers.
Focused Strategy

About 95 percent of our consolidated net income today comes from predictable rate-base-driven earnings. Our focused strategy is to modernize our infrastructure and ensure safe and reliable operations.  We have invested more than $1.4 billion during the past three years to repair, rehabilitate or replace aging segments of our pipeline network. We plan to accelerate our capital spending through the end of fiscal 2018 to advance our highest priorities of safety and reliability.  Investors are applauding natural gas utilities for making these critical infrastructure investments. The market recognizes the potential gains and reduced operational risks for innovative distribution companies like Atmos Energy that

increase safeguards for the public. This support was evident on November 14, 2013, when our share price set an alltime high of $47.44.  In fiscal 2013, we invested a record $845.0 million in capital expenditures primarily for system improvements. For nearly 93 percent of that investment, we expect to begin earning a return on it within one year. Approximately 70 percent, or $589 million, of our fiscal 2013 capital spending was dedicated to safety and reliability projects.  The $112.1 million year-over-year increase in our fiscal 2013 capital expenditures was due to major pipeline expansion projects and more spending on cathodic protection to prevent corrosion of pipelines in our regulated transmission and storage segment.  Atmos Pipeline­Texas (APT), our regulated intrastate transmission and storage unit, completed major pipeline expansions that added capacity and capability to serve local gas utility distribution systems, including our Mid-Tex Division. Of note was the installation of 69 miles of 24-inch Line WX west of Fort Worth.  APT also added two 1,590-horsepower compressors at the Waha Hub, which is a confluence of several large pipelines,

senior notes. Earlier, in October 2012, we executed forward starting interest-rate swaps. These swaps effectively fixed the treasury component of future debt issues at 3.13 percent for an expected $500 million issuance in fiscal 2015 and at 3.37 percent for an expected $250 million issuance in fiscal 2017.  The company's dividend payout ratio, which we expect to be between 53 percent and 55 percent in fiscal 2014, allows for continued dividend growth.  Recognizing the strength of the company's financial position, Standard & Poor's Corporation upgraded our senior secured debt rating from BBB+ to A- in October 2013. S&P cited an improved

business risk profile from an increasing contribution of earnings from our regulated operations and the focus of our nonregulated operations on its core delivered-gas business.
Creating Shareholder Value

We expect to invest between $830 million and $850 million in capital improvements in fiscal 2014. For the fiscal years 2015 to 2018, we estimate that our annual capital spending will average between $850 million and $950 million per year. We plan to finance our capital spending with cash flows, long-term debt and, to a lesser extent, equity.  We project that our rate base of regulatory assets will increase from approximately $4.4 billion today to between $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion by the end of fiscal 2018.  Due to our growing rate base, we estimate that our earnings per diluted share will rise at a compounded average growth rate of between 6 percent and 8 percent annually from fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2018.

 For fiscal 2014, we forecast that earnings per diluted share will be between $2.66 and $2.76, excluding unrealized margins. For fiscal 2018, we project earnings per diluted share could be between $3.45 and $3.65.
Board and Management Changes

Charles K. Vaughan, who retired from the board of directors and as lead director on December 27, 2012, was named by the board to serve as honorary director.  After becoming chairman, president and chief executive office in 1983, Charlie virtually saved the company from imminent failure and likely acquisition by a much larger utility. His watchwords of independence and prosperity led to

his devising an innovative strategy to expand and diversify operations. As a result, he built Atmos Energy into a leader in the natural gas distribution industry.  With more than 56 years of service to the company, Charlie continues to provide his wise counsel and strength of character to help guide and encourage our progress. We thank him for his willingness to continue serving our shareholders, customers and employees with the deep dedication that he has demonstrated throughout his career.  On April 1, 2013, Robert W. Best retired as executive chairman and as an employee of the company. Subsequent to his retirement, the board of directors appointed him to be chairman of the board.
