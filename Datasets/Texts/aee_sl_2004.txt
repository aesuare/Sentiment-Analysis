TO MY FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS, 




IN 2004, AMEREN CONTINUED TO DELIVER VALUE FOR YOU, AND ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS, AS WE EXECUTED THE STRATEGIES THAT HAVE MADE YOUR COMPANY ONE OF THE NATION'S TOP ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITIES.

AT $50.14 PER SHARE, AMEREN'S SHARE PRICE CLOSED 2004 AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. INCLUDING DIVIDENDS, THIS APPRECIATION IN SHARE PRICE BRINGS AMEREN'S FIVE-YEAR CUMULATIVE RETURN TO ALMOST 108 PERCENT.
 
WHILE ONGOING EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2004 WERE MODESTLY BELOW 2003 EARNINGS PER SHARE DUE TO MILD WEATHER, THE EARLY FINANCING OF OUR ILLINOIS 0OWER COMPANY ACQUISITION AND THE CALLAWAY NUCLEAR PLANT REFUELING AND MAINTENANCE OUTAGE, OUR SHARE PRICE ENDED THE YEAR AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH. IN ADDITION, OUR DIVIDEND YIELD OF MORE THAN 5 PERCENT DURING 2004 RANKED AMEREN AMONG THE TOP 10 YIELDING COMPANIES IN THE S&P 500ü  INDEX, AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS REMAINED AMONG THE STRONGEST OF ANY OF THOSE COMPANIES.
AMEREN PRODUCED A TOTAL ANNUAL RETURN (DIVIDENDS PLUS SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION  OF MORE THAN 15 PERCENT IN 2004, BRINGING OUR FIVE-YEAR CUMULATIVE RETURN TO ALMOST 108 PERCENT. THESE RETURNS WOULD BE IMPRESSIVE IN ANY MARKET, BUT I BELIEVE THEY ARE ESPECIALLY MEANINGFUL IN THE MARKETS WE
 
HAVE EXPERIENCED OVER THE PAST lVE YEARS, WHEN AN INVESTMENT IN THE S&P 500 WOULD HAVE LOST A CUMULATIVE 11 PERCENT.
AS I LOOK BACK OVER 2004, I AM PROUD OF THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE WE ACHIEVED. BUT I AM EVEN MORE PROUD OF THE PROGRESS WE MADE IN POSITIONING AMEREN FOR FUTURE SUCCESS.

02E0A2I.' &/2 4(E &5452E
AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST OF THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WILL PREPARE US FOR THE FUTURE IS OUR PURCHASE OF ILLINOIS POWER. THIS ACQUISITION ADDED ONE MILLION CUSTOMERS TO OUR SYSTEM, INCREASED OUR ASSET BASE TO MORE THAN $17 BILLION, WILL RAISE OUR ANNUAL REVENUE TO MORE THAN $6 BILLION AND MOVED OUR COMPANY TO THE TOP TIER OF THE ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITY INDUSTRY. IN FACT, THE ADDITION OF ILLINOIS POWER VIRTUALLY DOUBLED
 







OUR NATURAL GAS BUSINESS OVERNIGHT TO MORE THAN 9PP,000 CUSTOMERS, MAKING AMEREN ONE OF THE LARGEST GAS DELIVERY COMPANIES IN THE 5.S. BY CUSTOMER COUNT.
FURTHERMORE, WE COMPLETED OUR PURCHASE OF
ILLINOIS 0OWER IN ONLY EIGHT MONTHS. THIS WAS ONE MONTH FASTER THAN OUR 2003 ACQUISITION OF CI,C/20 INC., PARENT COMPANY OF CENTRAL
ILLINOIS ,IGHT COMPANY.

 
NOW OPERATING AS AMERENIP, WE EXPECT THIS COMPANY TO ADD ABOUT 9 TO 13 CENTS PER SHARE TO EARNINGS OVER THE lRST TWO YEARS OF OUR OWNERSHIP. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT WILL PROVIDE FUTURE EARNINGS GROWTH POTENTIAL. WE ARE NOW EVEN BETTER POSITIONED TO CONTINUE DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISE TO SAFEGUARD YOUR CAPITAL AND PROVIDE YOU A RELIABLE AND SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF INCOME.
I DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST, HOWEVER, THAT OUR BUSINESS FOCUS IS SHIFTING PRIMARILY TO GROWTH.
IF ANYTHING, IN THIS PAST YEAR, WE SHARPENED OUR FOCUS ON THE BASICS OF OPERATING AN EFlCIENT, LOW-COST ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITY n SO MUCH SO THAT WE'VE MADE FOCUS THE THEME OF THIS YEAR'S ANNUAL REPORT.
 
YOU
+NOW...
AT MORE THAN 5 PERCENT, OUR DIVIDEND YIELD WAS RANKED AMONG THE TOP 10 OF ALL S&P 500 COMPANIES IN 2004, WHILE OUR TOTAL ANNUAL RETURN HAS OUTPERFORMED THE S&P 500 BY 18 PERCENT OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

WHY IS FOCUS SO IMPORTANT? BECAUSE WITHOUT FOCUS, COMPANIES TEND TO DRIFT FROM THE BASICS, GET CAUGHT UP IN THE LATEST TRENDS, OR BECOME COMPLACENT AND MISS OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE. WE WON'T MISS THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. /UR VISION IS TO DRIVE PERFORMANCE TO INDUSTRY-LEADING LEVELS IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS.

TO ACHIEVE THIS VISION, WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER A TALENTED AND EXPERIENCED SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM WITH A STRONG TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THEY ARE DOING TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION.

AT AMEREN, WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT COST CONTROL IS A KEY TO SUCCESS IN ANY BUSINESS. WARNER BAXTER, AMEREN'S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFlCER, IS THE MAIN FORCE BEHIND OUR COMMITMENT TO CONTROLLING COSTS. (E IS A RELENTLESS COST CUTTER WHO KEEPS THE REST OF OUR TEAM EQUALLY FOCUSED ON THIS CRITICAL AREA.
 







 
FOR A MOSTLY REGULATED ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITY LIKE AMEREN, EFFECTIVE COST CONTROL ALLOWS US TO SUCCEED EVEN WHILE KEEPING RATES LOW. AMEREN NOW PROVIDES ELECTRICITY TO OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS AT A BLENDED RATE, INCLUDING AMERENIP, OF 6.00 CENTS PER KILOWATTHOUR, COMPARED TO AVERAGE BLENDED RETAIL RATES IN THE 5.3. OF 7.49 CENTS. THAT MAKES OUR RATES NEARLY 20 PERCENT BELOW THE 5.3. AVERAGE AND AMONG THE LOWEST ELECTRIC RATES ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD.
THE CI03C/ INCORPORATED MERGER AND THE TWO ACQUISITIONS WE'VE COMPLETED IN RECENT YEARS HAVE HELPED US MANAGE COSTS. THEY ALLOWED US TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD AND COMBINE THE PURCHASING POWER OF FOUR UTILITIES. IN 2004, WE FURTHER LEVERAGED THIS PURCHASING POWER THROUGH hSTRATEGIC SOURCING n A SYSTEMATIC PROCESS TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF THE MATERIALS AND SERVICES WE
PURCHASE. WITH ROUGHLY $1 BILLION OF ANNUAL PURCHASING, WE BELIEVE WE CAN SIGNIlCANTLY REDUCE ANNUAL SPENDING. ,ED BY DAN COLE, THE lRST YEAR OF THIS EFFORT PRODUCED
 
$15 MILLION IN CASH SAVINGS, AND IN 2005 WE EXPECT TO DO EVEN BETTER.
IN OUR POWER GENERATION BUSINESS, LOW COST AND HIGH PRODUCTION ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT. IN 2004, WE MADE SIGNIlCANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH.
5NDER THE LEADERSHIP OF ALAN +ELLEY
AND CHUCK .ASLUND, OUR COAL AND

/UR VISION IS TO DRIVE PERFORMANCE TO INDUSTRY-LEADING LEVELS IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS.

AMEREN NOW SERVES 2.3 MILLION ELECTRIC AND MORE THAN 900,000 NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS OVER A 64,000-SQUARE-MILE AREA OF MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS.
AMEREN5E IS THE LARGEST ELECTRIC UTILITY IN MISSOURI, AND AMEREN IS  ONE  OF THE LARGEST GAS DELIVERY COMPANIES IN THE COUNTRY BY CUSTOMER COUNT.
 







ALAN AND CHUCK TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE DOWN CAPITAL AND MAINTENANCE COSTS, TO FURTHER IMPROVE OUR CAPACITY FACTORS AND PLANT AVAILABILITY AND TO REDUCE EMISSIONS TO EVEN LOWER LEVELS.

CAPACITY FACTOR IS THE RATIO OF OUR PLANTS' NET GENERATION THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TO THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT COULD HAVE BEEN GENERATED AT CONTINUOUS FULL-POWER OPERATION.
 
NUCLEAR PLANTS ACHIEVED AN ALL-TIME COMPANY LOW TOTAL GENERATING COST OF
$25.07 PER MEGAWATTHOUR, PLACING US AMONG THE LOWEST COST GENERATORS IN THE
5.3. /UR PLANTS ALSO ACHIEVED AN ALL-TIME RECORD CAPACITY FACTOR OF 76 PERCENT AND AN ALL-TIME PRODUCTION RECORD OF 75 MILLION MEGAWATTHOURS, ALL WHILE CONTINUING
TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR COAL-lRED GENERATING PLANTS HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST NITROGEN OXIDE EMITTING UNITS IN THE 5.3., ACCORDING TO THE 5.3.
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY.

THESE IMPROVEMENTS POSITION US TO SUCCEED IN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, AND IN MARKETS WHERE PRICE IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE COST OF NATURAL GAS. (OWEVER, AS GOOD AS OUR PERFORMANCE IN 2004 WAS, WE ARE NOT ABOUT TO SLOW DOWN. TOM 6OSS, OUR CHIEF OPERATING OFlCER, HAS CHALLENGED
 
IN ENERGY DELIVERY, ANOTHER KEY TO OUR SUCCESS IS CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. DECADES OF FOCUSING ON IMPROVING OUR ENERGY DELIVERY BUSINESS HAS PLACED AMEREN'S CUSTOMER SATISFACTION RATINGS IN THE TOP QUARTILE OF OUR INDUSTRY, BUT SCOTT CISEL, WHO LEADS ENERGY
DELIVERY IN ILLINOIS, AND 2ICHARD MARK, WHO HAS THE SAME ROLE IN MISSOURI, ARE NOT SATISlED WITH THAT LEVEL OF PERFORMANCE. THEY ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING OUR DELIVERY SERVICE AND MOVING OUR SATISFACTION RATINGS TO THE VERY TOP OF OUR INDUSTRY. FORTUNATELY, THEY ARE BLESSED WITH CAPABLE, HARD-WORKING EMPLOYEES WHO ARE EQUALLY COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE BEST ELECTRIC AND GAS SERVICE IN AMERICA.

LOOKING FORWARD, WE STILL FACE SIGNIlCANT CHALLENGES IN REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE
 ARENAS. AS A COMPANY WITH REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM REGULATED SOURCES, WE MUST PLAY A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY POLICY. /UR GENERAL COUNSEL, STEVE SULLIVAN, LEADS AMEREN'S EXPERIENCED AND RESOURCEFUL REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE TEAM IN ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES.

FOR INSTANCE, ILLINOIS BEGAN MOVING TO OPEN COMPETITION IN 1998, AND YEAR-END 2006 WILL MARK THE lNAL SHIFT TO FULLY COMPETITIVE POWER MARKETS. AT THAT TIME, THE RATE FREEZE THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE IN ILLINOIS SINCE 1998 WILL EXPIRE. WITH 60 PERCENT   OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE NOW IN ILLINOIS, OUR
AMEREN TEAM WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE
ILLINOIS COMMERCE COMMISSION STAFF IN 2004 TO PLAN FOR THIS TRANSITION. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN 2005.

WE EXPECT OUR ILLINOIS ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES TO PROCURE ALL THEIR POWER AFTER 2006 THROUGH AN AUCTION MONITORED BY
ILLINOIS REGULATORS. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT OUR NON RATE-REGULATED POWER GENERATION
BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO SELL APPROXIMATELY 1T MILLION MEGAWATTHOURS OF POWER, CURRENTLY
SYSTEM /PERATOR IN 2004, LED BY DAVE WHITELEY, WE ARE EQUALLY WELL POSITIONED TO COMPETE BEYOND OUR TRADITIONAL MARKET AREA.

COMMITTED TO THESE DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES, IN THE OPEN MARKET. MARKET PRICES FOR SIMILAR CONTRACTS TODAY ARE ABOVE THE LEVELS WE RECEIVE UNDER OUR CURRENT COMMITMENTS.
THIS CHANGE PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY TODAY, BUT IT IS ALSO A RISK THAT MUST BE MANAGED OVER THE LONG TERM. I BELIEVE THE LOCATION AND LOW COST OF OUR GENERATION ASSETS POSITION AMEREN VERY WELL TO COMPETE IN THE NEW ILLINOIS MARKET. AND, WITH OUR ENTRY INTO THE MIDWEST INDEPENDENT TRANSMISSION
 
ANOTHER REGULATORY CHALLENGE IS THAT ELECTRIC RATES FOR AMEREN'S OPERATING COMPANIES HAVE BEEN EITHER FROZEN OR DECLINING FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 12 YEARS TO 22 YEARS.
AS I HAVE SAID, DUE TO OUR COST CONTROL EFFORTS, WE HAVE SUCCEEDED EVEN WITH THESE lXED OR DECLINING RATES n BUT WE MUST
BE READY FOR THE FUTURE. DURING 2005 AND 2006, WE WILL SUBMIT REGULATORY lLINGS IN
MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT YOU, OUR SHAREHOLDERS, CONTINUE TO EARN A FAIR RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENTS.
A C5,452E /F S5CCESS
THE INTENT OF THE COMBINED INITIATIVES
I'VE DESCRIBED IS TO RAISE AMEREN'S OVERALL PERFORMANCE TO INDUSTRY-LEADING LEVELS. WE ARE NO LONGER CONTENT TO RANK hAMONGv THE BEST UTILITIES IN THE 5.S.
WE WANT TO BE hTHE BEST.v /F COURSE, ACHIEVING THAT DISTINCTION REQUIRES HIGHLY ENGAGED EMPLOYEES WHO ARE FOCUSED AND COMMITTED TO GREAT RESULTS.
 






 

WE HAVE THESE EMPLOYEES AT AMEREN, AND IN 2004, WE ESTABLISHED A NEW PROGRAM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEM. THE 0RESIDENT'S PERFORMANCE LEADERSHIP AWARD AFlRMS OUR BELIEF THAT PEOPLE ARE THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SUCCESS AND THE KEY TO ACHIEVING OUR VISION. 0ART OF A BROADER CULTURE-CHANGE EFFORT BEING LED BY DONNA MARTIN, OUR CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCES OFlCER, THIS PROGRAM RECOGNIZES A SMALL NUMBER OF AMEREN EMPLOYEES AS THE hBEST OF THE BESTv EACH YEAR BY REWARDING AND RECOGNIZING HIGH ACHIEVERS AT AMEREN AND THE KIND OF EMPLOYEES WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISES TO YOU, OUR SHAREHOLDERS, IN 2005 AND BEYOND.

FINALLY, CLIFFORD ,. 'REENWALT, THOMAS
