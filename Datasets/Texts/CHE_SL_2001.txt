                                           To Our Fellow Shareholders
No doubt about it: 2001 was a tough year. Our flagship Roto-Rooter subsidiary particularly felt the pinch of the weak economy as customers deferred optional plumbing projects
or took them on as do-it-yourselfers, and noncore HVAC businesses struggled. Likewise, Service America experienced a shortfall in retail sales as customers put off more economically sensitive purchases of new air conditioners and major appliances, along with duct cleaning and other demand repair services. Patient Care, however, having suffered from industry- wide reimbursement issues during the past few years, emerged from 2001 with a strong operating performance.
As 2001 progressed, we carefully analyzed our businesses and identified opportunities to streamline Chemed and optimize operations. We discontinued the Cadre Computer Resources subsidiary and announced an important restructuring effort which, when fully implemented, should result in significant savings and enhanced profitability.
Financial Results
For the year ended December 31, 2001, Chemed recorded a net loss of $1.07 per share, which included $1.95 per share in aftertax restructuring and similar expenses and other charges,
a loss of $.20 per share from discontinued operations, an extraordinary loss of $.18 per share in debt prepayment penalties, and capital gains from sales of investments of $.07 per share. Net income of $2.09 per share in 2000 included capital gains of $.23 per share and a loss from discontinued operations of $.02 per share. On a pro forma basis excluding capital gains and restructuring and similar expenses and other charges, Chemed’s earnings from continuing operations were $1.19 per share for 2001 as compared with $1.88 per share in 2000.
Service revenues and sales from continuing operations for 2001 were $477.1 million, 3% below 2000’s $492.4 million. For 2001, earnings before capital gains, interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) were $30.6 million versus EBITDA of $59.2 million for 2000, and for 2001, EBITDA represented 6% of revenues. Pro forma EBITDA for
2001 amounted to $48.0 million, or 10% of revenues.
Operations
Roto-Rooter’s revenues in 2001 of $269.4 million were
4% below prior year, primarily due to revenue shortfalls in Roto-Rooter’s plumbing and HVAC businesses. The resulting negative leverage caused a 4.4 percentage point decline (2.6 percentage points on a pro forma basis) in the gross margin, while net income declined to $3.4 million in 2001 versus $20.0 million in 2000. On a pro forma basis, Roto-Rooter’s income for 2001 amounted to $13.8 million as compared with $20.0 million in 2000.
As the economy improves, we expect Roto-Rooter’s revenues will improve. We are redoubling efforts to upgrade customer service and to improve the compensation opportunity for Roto-Rooter technicians. We’ve initiated sales and marketing efforts, including specific programs to gain commercial business. We’ve been increasing service force staffing, a key driver of revenue growth. We will continue to maintain
tight expense controls at all levels, and the restructuring of noncore HVAC and non-Roto-Rooter-branded plumbing operations should position Roto-Rooter for improved results in the year ahead.
For 2001, Service America recorded a net loss of $686,000

  versus net income of $1.1 million in 2000. On a pro forma basis, Service America’s earnings of $1.0 million in 2001 compare with $1.1 million in 2000. Service America is beginning to see the benefits of centralization projects and ongoing efforts to eliminate less-profitable contracts. Service America expects both service improvements and cost efficiencies from its centralized call center, dispatch, distribution, and purchasing operations. These improvements and efficiencies, along with marketing targeted toward retail sales and commercial accounts, should stabilize the contract base, boost retail revenues, and lead to future growth.
Patient Care’s net income of $526,000 in 2001 compares with net income of $2.1 million for 2000. Pro forma earnings grew 24%, to $2.6 million, in 2001 on revenue growth of 3%, to $141.4 million, as compared with earnings and revenues in 2000. Patient Care achieved these results through its continued focus on high-quality relationships with large referral sources and by providing supplemental staffing to meet increasing demand—particularly from Medicare agencies and assisted- living facilities—for healthcare personnel. Patient Care also benefited from improved Medicare reimbursements.
Restructuring for Future Growth
We entered 2001 with high expectations, having achieved two years of substantial growth led by outstanding results at Roto-Rooter. As growth plateaued during the year, we reexamined every operation for opportunities and began implementing corporate-wide restructuring initiatives. While these initiatives created substantial aftertax charges, they provided the freedom to move forward unencumbered by noncore and underperforming businesses. Additionally, the prepayment and refinancing of our debt enabled us to take advantage of attractive interest rates.
The restructuring and similar expenses and other charges comprise primarily write-offs associated with exiting unprof- itable businesses, costs of restructuring long-term stock incen- tives, severance costs, and other nonrecurring charges. Annual

savings expected from the implementation of these initiatives and the debt refinancing are estimated at $4 million to $5 million after taxes.
The restructuring process has been carefully considered, and while not an easy one, the process has created a leaner Chemed poised for future growth. We are already enjoying benefits from a number of these initiatives and expect an improved year because of them. We remain vigilant in seeking other oppor- tunities to cut costs, optimize operations, and increase efficiency in 2002.
Outlook
Chemed is now positioned for substantial ongoing savings and renewed growth. We are optimistic that our subsidiaries have the right plans in place to grow their businesses and profitability, any further deterioration in economic conditions notwithstanding. In the long term, each of our subsidiaries provides services that home owners, families, and businesses require, and we believe that by providing high quality and solid value, our businesses should prosper in the years ahead.
