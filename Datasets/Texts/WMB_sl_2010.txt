From left, President and Chief Executive Officer Alan Armstrong and Chairman Frank MacInnis

Dear fellow Williams shareholders,
It's our pleasure to write you for the first time as chairman and CEO, respectively, of Williams. We sincerely appreciate the strong leadership and dedicated service of Steve Malcolm, who retired as chairman, president and CEO in January. We're truly excited to be leading Williams right now ­ at a time when natural gas is poised to be a transformative force in the U.S. energy picture. Natural gas is a clean, abundant and domestic energy resource that will help reduce dependence on foreign oil and also create jobs in communities across the country. It's an important resource for not only heating, power generation and transportation, but also as a feedstock to the multi-billion-dollar U.S. petrochemical industry. Williams will play a big part in creating the infrastructure that will be required to bring these crucial supplies to markets. We have premier assets in growing new resource plays backed up by a tremendously knowledgeable and experienced workforce. There's more on those growth opportunities below. Looking at recent developments at Williams, we began this year much in the same way we began 2010 ­ by announcing a major change to the company's structure intended to increase the value of our businesses. On Feb. 16, we announced a plan to pursue separation of our exploration and production business, creating two publicly owned companies with better defined business and investment profiles. One company, still known as Williams, will focus primarily on large-scale infrastructure in the midstream, gas pipeline and olefins businesses. The new company will be a diversified, independent exploration and production company.

" During 2010, we accomplished several strategic expansions while initiating others. In fact, we invested nearly $4.4 billion in capital last year, including more than $2 billion in acquisitions."

Under the first step of this plan, an initial public offering of up to 20 percent of the new exploration and production company will be conducted later this year. At that point, Williams would continue to own at least 80 percent of the new company. Then, in 2012, we plan to fully separate the companies through a tax-free spinoff to Williams shareholders of the remaining interest. This decision by Williams' board and executive management team follows a long run of success under the integrated natural gas model. However, market expectations have changed, as has the industry itself. Many of you have expressed a strong preference to see the company spin off Exploration & Production so that it may be evaluated by the market in a manner comparable to its pure-play peers. Once the spinoff is complete, we believe both the growth potential and overall shareholder valuation of our assets will be enhanced. As part of this announcement, we also revealed plans to increase our quarterly dividend by 60 percent beginning with the first quarter of 2011, payable in June, with an additional 10 to 15 percent increase planned for June 2012. With this decision, along with our strong growth outlook, we intend to make Williams an even more attractive source of long-term returns for our shareholders. Shareholder value and enhanced growth prospects also drove the restructuring announcement that began 2010. Under that restructuring, we dropped most of our gas pipeline and midstream assets down to Williams Partners, the

master limited partnership in which we hold the general partner and majority limited-partner interest. The $12 billion transaction, which was largely completed in the first quarter of last year, left Williams owning a significantly increased portion of Williams Partners. And in a separate transaction in November, Williams completed a dropdown of the Piceance Basin gathering and treating assets to Williams Partners. During 2010, we accomplished several strategic expansions while initiating others. In fact, we invested nearly $4.4 billion in capital last year, including more than $2 billion in acquisitions. The biggest of these, our $925 million acquisition in North Dakota's Bakken Shale oil play, serves to diversify our exploration and production business, both in terms of geography and commodity segment. We are rapidly building a large-scale presence in the Marcellus Shale, where we've invested more than $1 billion since 2009. In 2010, we bolstered this position with Williams Partners' $150 million acquisition of gathering assets in Susquehanna County, Pa. In addition, our exploration and production business has established a position of approximately 100,000 acres in Pennsylvania. We also continue to invest in our growing olefins and Canadian midstream business, as we're in the process of building a 261-mile NGL/ olefins pipeline from our Fort McMurray facility to our fractionator near Edmonton in Alberta, Canada. We expect all of these investments to contribute to the earnings growth we've projected in our

guidance over the next two years, which includes another $4 billion in capital expenditures. Looking ahead, several factors point to an unmistakable need for new natural gas infrastructure. The domestic shale plays are rich sources of natural gas and they're developing rapidly. These new supplies require gathering, processing and transportation capacity in areas where infrastructure is inadequate. In addition, demand for natural gas liquids is rising in the petrochemical industry, which is looking for reliable supplies of low-cost feedstock. Geopolitical, economic and environmental realities also make a strong case for natural gas. As the United States reckons with a rapidly changing political landscape in the Middle East, it's becoming ever more apparent that stable, long-term supplies of domestic energy are critical to national security. But it's not just about security. Even assuming that prices rebound over the next few years, natural gas still will be a far more cost-effective and reliable fuel source than most other viable alternatives. Just as important are the significant environmental advantages of natural gas, which is the cleanest burning fossil fuel. In order for us to fully realize the potential of this great resource, one thing that is needed is clear, consistent regulations across the board. In many areas, development can be hampered because of unclear or even contradictory regulations at the state and/or local levels. We believe that a clear and consistent set of regulations would create the best

environment to realize the potential of our vast natural gas resources. In pursuing the enormous opportunities presented by the growing demand for energy infrastructure, we acknowledge and accept our obligation to do so responsibly. Being a good steward to the environment and a good neighbor to our communities is a responsibility we take to heart. We don't do these things because that's what is expected of us. We do them because they're the right thing to do. That's why we work every day to forge meaningful partnerships with landowners, community leaders, regulators and nongovernmental agencies in the areas where we operate. And when we do sit down with our stakeholders, we do so, first and foremost, to engage in mutually beneficial relationships that create trust over the long term. It's an exciting time for our company as we embark on another transformative milestone in our 103-year history. We hope you share our excitement. Thank you for your continued support and confidence.

" Being a good steward to the environment and a good neighbor to our communities is a responsibility we take to heart. We don't do these things because that's what is expected of us. We do them because they're the right thing to do."
