 Dear Shareholders,
P&G’s Purpose–to touch and
improve lives, now and for generations to come–is inspiring and pervasive. Our Purpose is tightly and deliberately linked to our business and financial goals: P&G’s Purpose inspires our strategic choices; it leads us to bigger and better innovation; it drives brilliant execution; and it compels us to make a difference in areas such as sustainability and social responsibility not merely to be a good citizen, but more importantly, to create future opportunities to touch and improve lives–and, in so doing, to keep our Company growing.

(1) Organic sales growth is sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. See page 49 for a reconciliation of organic sales growth to net sales growth.
(2) Core EPS is a measure of the Company’s diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations excluding charges for potential competition law fines, a charge related to a tax provision for retiree healthcare subsidy payments in the recently enacted U.S. healthcare reform legislation and incremental Corporate restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2009 versus 2008 to offset the dilutive impact of the Folgers divestiture. See page 50 for a reconciliation of Core EPS to diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations.
(3) Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the gains on the divestiture of the global pharmaceuticals business. For 2010, adjusted free cash flow of $13,985 million is operating cash flow of $16,072 million less capital spending of $3,067 million plus the tax payments made on the gains from the global pharmaceuticals divestitures of $980 million. Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 125% is adjusted free cash flow of $13,985 million divided by net earnings of $12,736 million less gains of $1,585 million from the global pharmaceuticals divestitures.
2 The Procter & Gamble Company
Last year, we updated P&G’s growth strategy to connect
it explicitly to our Company’s Purpose. We focused on three specific choices: to grow P&G’s core brands and categories with an unrelenting focus on innovation; to build our business with unserved and underserved consumers; and
to continue to grow and develop faster-growing, higher- margin businesses with global leadership potential.
These strategic choices are unified by one simple, over- arching growth strategy: to touch and improve the lives
of MORE CONSUMERS in MORE PARTS OF THE WORLD, MORE COMPLETELY. We’ve made this the centerpiece of our leadership agenda because we believe a Purpose-inspired growth strategy is intrinsically rewarding and motivating.
It unleashes creativity, commitment and peak performance in P&G people. It attracts talent and partners. It builds goodwill with external stakeholders.
We are executing across all three dimensions of this growth strategy on all of our businesses around the world. The Company’s performance in the 2010 fiscal year, and the strength with which we have entered the 2011 fiscal year, demonstrate that our Purpose-inspired growth strategy
is working.
Substantial Progress toward Growth Goals
We also renewed our growth goals last year. Our fundamental objective is the creation of value for shareholders at industry leadership levels on a consistent basis. More specifically,
our goal is to deliver total shareholder return that consistently ranks P&G among the top-third of our peers—the best performing consumer products companies in the world.
In addition, we measure our progress through a combination of consumer and financial goals. We made substantial progress in fiscal 2010:
• Organic sales grew 3%, in line with Company expectations.(1)
• Core earnings per share grew 6%, roughly double our going-in objective for the year.(2)
• Adjusted free cash flow was 125% of net earnings, well above our target level.(3)
We also made substantial progress toward profitable share growth, a key priority. A year ago, our global market share was down about half a point versus prior-year levels; today,
as I write this, our global market share is up nearly half a point and accelerating. Last year, we were building market share
in businesses accounting for only about 33% of sales; today, we are building share in brands and countries accounting for about 66% of sales and P&G’s market share is growing in 14 of our top 17 countries.
In addition, we reached an additional 200 million consumers, bringing the total served to 4.2 billion—on track toward our goal of reaching 5 billion consumers by fiscal 2015. Average per capita spending on P&G products increased in 70% of our top countries, up from 60% in fiscal 2009. And, global household penetration—the percentage of households using at least one P&G product—increased nearly two percentage points, to 61%.
On the strength of these results, we paid approximately $5.5 billion in dividends and returned $6 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of P&G stock. Based on our current market capitalization, dividends and share repurchases provide shareholders with an effective cash yield of more than 6%, with additional potential for capital appreciation.
In April, we increased our quarterly dividend by 9.5%, making this the 120th consecutive year that P&G has paid a dividend and the 54th consecutive year that the dividend has increased. Over those 54 years, the dividend has increased at an annual compound average rate of approximately 9.5%.
Purpose-inspired Growth Strategy: Our path forward

This is encouraging performance, inspired by the Purpose that motivates our people and partners and driven primarily by our strong, multiyear innovation program. We are innovating to win in every P&G category, we are investing behind these innovations to build profitable market share and we are continually increasing productivity that funds our investments in future growth. This investment allows us to continually replenish our multiyear innovation pipeline.
Innovating to Win
Innovation has been—and will continue to be—at the heart of our success. In fiscal 2010, for the fourth consecutive year, we invested nearly $2 billion in Research & Development. In fact, we invest about 50% more than our closest competitor and more than most of our closest competitors combined. This leadership level of investment is multiplied by our global network of external innovation partners, which leads to an effective investment in innovation that far exceeds the reported spending.
One measure of the strength of our innovation program is the SymphonyIRI Group New Product Pacesetters report— the annual list of the biggest innovations in our industry as measured by sales. Over the past 15 years, 125 P&G innovations have earned a spot on the Top 25 Pacesetters list—more than our six largest competitors combined.
Based on this track record, SymphonyIRI recognized P&G as the most innovative manufacturer in the consumer packaged goods industry for the last decade—presenting the Company with its “Outstanding Achievement in Innovation” award. In 2009, P&G launched 5 of the top 10 most successful non-food innovations as judged by SymphonyIRI: Tide Total Care, Gillette Venus Embrace, Bounty Extra Soft, Always Infinity and Secret Flawless.
Our innovation program is guided by the Company's Purpose-inspired growth strategy:
• We are touching and improving MORE CONSUMERS’
lives by innovating and expanding vertically, up and down value tiers.
• We are touching and improving lives in MORE PARTS OF
THE WORLD by innovating and expanding geographically, into new white spaces where we haven’t been competing.
• We are touching and improving consumers’ lives MORE COMPLETELY by innovating to improve existing products, by creating or entering adjacent categories and by driving regimen use that broadens our product portfolios.
We have a strong multiyear pipeline that will continue to drive growth in the future. The impact of this innovation program is already evident. We have featured six examples in the editorial section that follows this letter, but I want to share perspective here as well to give you a sense of both the strength and breadth of innovation coming from P&G. I’ll highlight just three representative businesses to illustrate.
Male Grooming
Fusion has now grown share for 18 consecutive quarters, and we recently launched Gillette Fusion ProGlide. Consumer testing shows that men prefer the Fusion ProGlide family at a ratio of up to 2-to-1 over Gillette Fusion. In the middle
tier, we recently launched a new Mach3 razor specifically designed to better meet the needs of emerging-market consumers. As a result, Mach3 shares are at record levels in Argentina, Brazil and India.
In February, we launched a complete line of Gillette male grooming solutions in Brazil, and are now expanding in several Latin American countries. In March, we introduced a scientific face care regimen under the Gillette name in China. In June, we introduced Gillette Fusion ProSeries in North America.

4 The Procter & Gamble Company Fabric Care
We’re expanding our portfolio horizontally with Tide Stain Release and Ariel Professional in laundry additives, and Bounce Dryer Bar in the fabric enhancer category. We are also expanding vertically and into geographic white space.
In Western Europe, we are innovating in the premium tier with Ariel Excel Gel, a new-to-the-world gel that is consumer preferred by a margin of 2 to 1. In Japan, our newest laundry brand, Sarasa, is priced at a 15% premium versus the category average and is designed for consumers who want
a laundry detergent that cleans well, but also provides natural and gentle benefits.
We introduced Ace in Colombia during the September quarter and Tide Naturals in India during the December quarter. Tide Naturals is priced 30% lower than regular
Tide, enabling us to reach a much broader spectrum of Indian households. Ace is a mid-tier laundry brand that complements Ariel’s stain removal equity and Bold’s softness equity. Ace has become P&G’s 23rd billion-dollar brand.
Oral Care
Oral-B toothpaste and toothbrush shares in Brazil continue to exceed expectations. Based on our in-market success, we have initiated the second wave of our toothpaste expansion plan which will take us beyond the pharmacy channel.
The Oral-B toothpaste launch in Belgium and the Netherlands is also going well—with Oral-B toothpaste approaching double-digit shares and driving P&G to overall Oral Care market share leadership in both countries since being launched in February 2009.
Crest Pro-Health is off to a strong start in China, helping to drive Oral Care shipments in China up high single digits in the final quarter of the fiscal year. The Crest Pro-Health formula is being expanded to other markets around the world, as well.
In March, we launched Crest 3D White in North America. 3D White is a new regimen comprised of toothpaste, brush, rinse and Professional Effects whitestrips that work in combination to clean, whiten and protect teeth while providing health benefits expected from Crest and Oral-B.
120 years
P&G has paid a dividend for 120 consecutive years—and 2010 marked the 54th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Looking Ahead
Many of our most significant innovations just launched in North America between March and June 2010. They will have a much bigger impact on fiscal 2011 than they had this past year as we continue to leverage them in North America and to expand them to additional markets. And, of course, we will bring new innovations to market. More specifically:
• Pampers with Dry Max will expand across Western Europe this year.
• Gillette Fusion ProGlide will roll out to more than 40 countries over the next two years.
• The new Pantene formulations will expand globally over the next two years.
• We are aggressively working to merge the product innovation and geographic expansion plans of Ambi Pur with the Febreze franchise, following the close of the Ambi Pur acquisition in early July. Our air care business now spans 84 countries.
• Oral Care is introducing a new Crest Clinical line of products to treat two of the most common oral care problems: gingivitis and tooth sensitivity. The Crest Clinical Sensitivity toothpaste provides the maximum strength available over the counter. Crest Clinical will start shipping in North America in August.
In total, P&G competes in 38 product categories globally, but we are not present in all these categories in all of our priority markets. For example, as a total Company, we compete in less than 50% of potential country/category combinations in our top 50 markets. This presents a tremendous growth opportunity. Our objective is to fill out our product portfolio in every category and then expand to the most relevant geographic markets. This objective is driving clear, strategic choices about where to innovate and expand to ensure our total-Company lineup is reaching more consumers in more parts of the world, more completely.
There are examples in every P&G category. I cite these few just to provide perspective on the strength and breadth of our innovation program. We currently have the strongest multiyear innovation program I’ve seen in my 30-year career at P&G. And as strong as the program has been during this past fiscal year, we are equally pleased with the quality of our pipeline going forward. It’s full of innovations that are sure to touch and improve the lives of consumers for years to come.
$11.5billion
The amount we returned to P&G shareholders in 2010 in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
               
Investing to Grow, Changing to Lead
We are supporting our innovation program with strong levels of marketing investment. We delivered a 20% increase in consumer impressions—the number of times consumers hear about our brands and new products—this fiscal year, with most of the increase in the second half of the fiscal year behind many of the innovations I just described.
This investment is critical. Decades of experience have demonstrated that making people aware of our innovation and motivating them to try our new products is the key to long-term success. When people experience the innovation we bring to market, they are frequently delighted, which in turn drives repurchase and sustainable share growth. This
is the foundation of brand building, and P&G is committed to investing sufficiently and consistently to support innovation and build brands that thrive for decades.
One of the most important ways we fuel investments
in innovation and brand building is through cost savings and productivity improvements. P&G is very disciplined about cash management and cost reduction. We are strengthening this discipline with a culture that continually simplifies the way we work and increases productivity.
Simplification is a significant opportunity for us, particularly given the breadth of our business and brand portfolios. For example, we have more than 16,000 product formulas and use more than 4,000 colors in our product labels and plastic packaging. Over the next two years, we expect to reduce the number of formulas and package specifications by 30% and to reduce the number of colors we use by 50–75%. Color simplification alone has the potential to generate up to $50 million in annual savings. We have simplification projects underway throughout the Company, led by line management and managed with the same discipline and integration that we use for global product launches. This will remain an ongoing priority for us.
Another good example of how we’re becoming more productive is the “digitization” of P&G. With digitization, our goal is to standardize, automate and integrate systems and data so we can create a real-time operating and decision- making environment. We want P&G to be the most technology-enabled company in the world.
We are targeting a 20–25% reduction in some spending areas and we are looking for a sevenfold increase in real-time data. By getting the right data to the right decision makers at the right time, we can become increasingly efficient and productive.
$ 2billion
The approximate amount P&G invests in innovation each year.
A good illustration is logistics. We are digitizing our Transportation Management systems, including what we call our “Control Tower.” Think of this as an “air traffic control system” for ground transportation. The real-time information this system provides allows us to coordinate scheduling
and truck movement for all inbound and outbound transportation. So far, we’re on track to reduce the number of “deadhead legs”—or, empty truck shipments—by more than 15%. We currently have control tower approaches
in place covering about one-quarter of our business in both developing and developed markets. We think increasing
the capacity utilization of trucks can save more than
$200 million annually.
Another way we are increasing productivity is by turning the Company’s size into scale and our scale into growth. To do this, we are increasingly competing as one Company. Our individual categories, brands, countries and functions are all critical and each has unique value to add. But at the total- Company level, we can create scale advantages by allocating resources more strategically and efficiently than any individual business can do on its own. The combination of the individual components is greater together as one Company than the sum of the parts—and we are focused on maximizing this total value.
We are working across our businesses and markets to leverage P&G scale. A good example is the global sponsorship agreement we signed in July with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The partnership gives P&G global sponsorship rights for the next five Olympic Games, from London 2012 through the 2020 Olympic Games, enabling
the Company to take the Games to the more than 4 billion consumers worldwide served by P&G brands today. The breadth of P&G’s portfolio and the depth of our reach
make this the most far-reaching Olympic partnership. It demonstrates the powerful appeal of our brand portfolio and its tremendous global scale. No other consumer products company could create a comparable partnership with the IOC.

Times, March 2, 2010.)

6 The Procter & Gamble Company
As part of this sponsorship, we also announced the global expansion of our Proud Sponsor of Moms campaign. We will build upon the success of our Team USA partnership at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, which resulted in increased favorability ratings for P&G and our brands, greater market share and nearly $100 million in incremental sales. P&G will leverage the IOC partnership to deliver on our growth strategy and to help improve the lives of athletes, moms and their families around the world in several ways:
• We will continue to support families of Olympians, reapplying on-site activities from the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games.
• As part of the Proud Sponsor of Moms campaign, our Thank You, Mom program will continue in conjunction with the IOC’s inaugural Youth Olympic Games to be held in Singapore in August 2010, helping 25 moms of Youth Olympians from around the world with their travel and lodging costs so they can be in Singapore with their children as they compete.
• We will produce a documentary video series called “Raising an Olympian, The P&G Momumentary Project” to celebrate the dedication and sacrifice of moms, families and their Olympians. The video series will tell the stories of Olympians as seen through the eyes of their moms. It will be shown leading up to and during the London 2012 Olympic Games and will aim to answer the question, “What does it take
to raise an Olympian?”
By leveraging P&G scale and competing more effectively as one Company—rather than as individual businesses and brands alone—we are able to touch and improve more lives while creating meaningful competitive advantage.
Work to Do
While we are encouraged by the Company’s recent performance, I don’t want to imply that we are satisfied.
Our results were ahead of our going-in expectations in nearly every area, but we still have some significant opportunities for improvement.
Our results on some big brands and in some big categories have been soft. We are not yet growing share on every business but we have robust innovation and marketing plans in place to accelerate share growth across the portfolio.
We also need to continue our disciplined cost reduction and cash management efforts. We need to take even more cost out because there are still more investments we need to put in to keep driving profitable market share growth.
If we build on our successes, address our shortfalls
and implement our strategy with excellence—which is precisely what we are focused on doing—we will continue to accelerate growth on both the top- and bottom-line, and we expect this to be reflected in stronger market share trends.
Inspired to Perform
As I wrote at the beginning of this letter, we have placed significant emphasis on P&G’s Purpose because we believe it inspires people to perform at their peak.
Fulfilling P&G’s Purpose is not merely a noble ideal. It
is potentially a game-changing growth strategy because it unleashes creativity and capability. Our purpose as individuals inspires our performance as professionals. The congruence of our Company Purpose and our personal purpose captures our imagination and passion. It focuses us on the consumers we serve and inspires empathy for them that, in turn, leads to insights, big ideas and innovation that drive growth. Simply put: Touching and improving people’s lives motivates peak performance. I believe that to my core.
Everywhere I travel, P&G people and our partners tell me they are inspired by what we can accomplish together. They tell me that they are inspired by the thought of what we can accomplish if we can infuse the work of our entire organization—all 127,000 of us—with the meaning that comes from our Purpose. We’re inspired by the thought of serving five billion people by the middle of this decade, and perhaps touching and improving the lives of nearly every person on the planet in our lifetimes. We’re inspired to create new innovations, ideas, services and products that improve people’s lives in ways we’ve not yet foreseen.
It is all this, taken together, that drives my confidence in P&G’s future. We have all the elements of a high-performing organization in place at P&G: passionate leaders at every level and in every part of our business; sound strategies that continue to provide abundant opportunities to grow; robust systems that enable us to operate with discipline and to collaborate inside and outside the Company; and a culture that enables, demands and rewards high performance. These pillars stand on a foundation of technical competence and the bedrock strength of our Purpose, Values and Principles that constitute the core of P&G.
I am honored to stand alongside Purpose-inspired leaders in every part of our organization who ensure that P&G touches and improves lives every day. It is a privilege to work with such outstanding people and I thank them for all they are doing to touch and improve lives and to grow our business.
