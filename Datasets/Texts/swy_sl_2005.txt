    During the year our same-store sales grew stronger each quarter (when adjusting for the Easter calendar shift), we increased market share in the U.S. supermarket channel 51 of 52 weeks, and we continued to roll out our
highly successful Lifestyle stores through an aggressive remodeling program. We also finished restructuring our labor contracts and have begun to experience solid operating and administrative expense leverage.
Results From Operations
Net income was $561.1 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2005 compared to $560.2 million ($1.25 per diluted share) in 2004. As indicated in the table at the bottom of page 4, earnings in 2005 were reduced by $104.6 million ($0.23 per diluted share) as a result of the following unusual, after-tax charges:
• Impairment of $33.9 million ($0.08 per diluted share) for Randall’s, our Texas operation.
• Charges of $34.1 million ($0.07 per diluted share) related to store exit activities in Texas, when we closed 26 underperforming stores in the Houston, Dallas/Fort Worth and Austin markets.
• Employee buyouts – primarily in Northern California and at Dominick’s, our Chicago-area operation – amounting to $36.6 million ($0.08 per diluted share).
Excluding these charges, adjusted income in 2005 was $665.7 million ($1.48 per diluted share).1
For 2004, the same table details after-tax charges and pro forma expense for the following items:
• Charges of $28.5 million ($0.06 per diluted share) for Dominick’s store exit activities.
• Contributions of $19.1 million ($0.04 per diluted share) to a Northern California UFCW multi-employer health and welfare plan.
• Accrual of $6.5 million ($0.01 per undiluted share) for rent holidays.
• Pro forma stock option expense of $44.8 million ($0.10 per diluted share).
Excluding these items, adjusted income in 2004 was $569.5 million ($1.26 per diluted share).1
Sales
Total sales rose 7.2% to $38.4 billion in 2005 from $35.8 billion in 2004, primarily due to consistent execution of our strategy, ongoing success of our Lifestyle stores and increased fuel sales. Excluding strike-affected stores in the first quarter of 2004, comparable-store sales climbed 4.6%, while identical- store sales (which do not include replacement stores) were up 4.4%. Further excluding fuel, comparable- store sales and identical-store sales increased 3.0% and 2.9%, respectively.
We are gratified by the strong, sequential improve- ment in our top-line growth trend during 2005. Excluding fuel and adjusting for the Easter holiday, we have now posted identical-store sales gains in 10 of the previous 12 quarters. The trend is broad-based as well; nine of our 10 operating divisions recorded positive ID sales in 2005.
Lifestyle Stores
With 458 Lifestyle stores in operation as of year-end 2005, they accounted for 26% of our total store base. These stores contributed significantly to sales growth throughout the year, and their operating performance and return on invested capital continue to exceed expectations.
To help ensure a successful launch and sustain performance well beyond the opening, we provide

After weathering three difficult years and retooling our strategy, we rebounded dramatically in 2005 and set the stage for further progress in 2006 and beyond.

    each Lifestyle store with extensive promotional
support. During the past year we have refined these activities so we can reduce the cost of promotions without diminishing operating results. Nevertheless, as anticipated, the cost of promoting Lifestyle openings in 2005 reduced gross margin and increased operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales.
As the Lifestyle stores opened last year mature in 2006, we expect their margins to improve and their contri- bution to operating profit to increase.
Gross Profit
Gross profit in 2005 decreased 65 basis points to 28.93% of sales. Higher fuel sales (which have a lower gross margin) accounted for 39 basis points of the decline. The remaining 26 basis-point reduction was due to grand openings of Lifestyle stores, targeted price investments, increased advertising expense and higher energy costs.
Operating and Administrative Expense
Operating and administrative expense last year decreased 53 basis points to 25.77% of sales. The significant pre-tax charges in 2005 and 2004 reflected in the table on page 4 (other than pro forma stock option expense) increased operating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales by a net 20 basis points. Stock option expense, labor costs associated with Lifestyle grand openings and higher energy costs also increased our O&A expense-to- sales ratio. However, these items were more than offset by the restructured labor agreements, increased fuel sales and reduced workers’ compensation costs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased $8.6 million to $402.6 million in 2005 despite higher average interest rates, primarily because total debt declined to $6.4 billion.
Capital Spending
Cash capital investments increased to $1.4 billion in 2005.
During the year we opened 21 new Lifestyle stores, completed 293 Lifestyle remodels and closed
48 older stores. In 2006 we plan to invest approxi- mately $1.6 billion in cash capital expenditures and open 20 to 25 new Lifestyle stores while completing some 280 Lifestyle remodels.
We also opened 20 fuel stations adjacent to our stores. As of year-end 2005, 314 of our stores sold gasoline, boosting sales at these locations while enhancing one-stop shopping convenience for our customers.
Cash Flow
Net cash flow from operating activities was $1.9 billion in 2005, down from $2.2 billion in 2004. Working capital contributed to cash flow in 2005, but at a lower level than in 2004. Net cash flow used by investing activities, which consists principally of cash paid for property additions, increased $243 million to $1.3 billion in 2005. Net cash flow used by financing activities – mainly cash used to retire debt – was
$467 million in 2005, down from $1.1 billion the prior year.
Free cash flow was $567.5 million in 2005.2 As a result, debt declined $404.8 million, cash and cash equivalents increased $106.5 million and we paid $44.9 million in dividends to stockholders.
Outlook
Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the strong rebound in our sales over the past year and by the unprecedented
success of our
Lifestyle stores. With our operating results steadily improving, our capital invest- ments continuing to exceed targeted rates of return, and our

    expanding line of proprietary brands gaining greater consumer acceptance each year, we are confident our growth strategy is working.
To help sustain this positive momentum, we are continuously developing and refining a host of sales- building and cost-reduction initiatives. Each of these initiatives is designed to enhance our customers’ shopping experience while making our operations more efficient. As we continue to grow sales while controlling expenses, we are better able to leverage our fixed and variable costs. Now that we’re back in the productivity loop, we intend to stay there.
On the following pages, we highlight some of the ways we have been reinventing the shopping experience. Focusing on the consumer, we are system- atically revitalizing our marketing plans, rejuvenating our store system and reinvigorating our corporate brand products. In the process, we also are reenergizing
our workforce. Collectively, no segment of our stakeholder base takes greater pride in the renaissance of Safeway than our 201,000 employees do, and no segment deserves more credit for the company’s resurgence. Once again I‘d like to acknowledge their tireless efforts to transform our business and satisfy our customers.
In closing, we are committed to enhancing customer satisfaction and shareholder value in 2006 and beyond. I’m convinced we have the right game plan and the right team to accomplish these objectives.
