CHEVRON CORPORATION 1998 ANNUAL REPORT

Staying focused...pursuing opportunities... shaping the future
 98
1998 was a tough year for Chevron and for the petroleum
industry. The depressed economic conditions in Asia re- duced the demand for petroleum products, and the result- ing worldwide oversupply of crude oil hammered prices. The price of U.S. benchmark crude dropped to its lowest annual average in 20 years, down some 30 percent from 1997. Chevron’s net income fell 59 percent to $1.339 billion from the record $3.256 billion earned in 1997.
All business segments hurt. With low prices squeezing margins, earnings were down in all our businesses – exploration and production; refining, marketing and transportation; and chemicals.
Worldwide exploration and production earnings fell by half, from $2.169 billion in 1997 to $1.098 billion in 1998. However, our production gains were one of the highlights of the year. Our worldwide net liquids production climbed 3 percent to 1.1 million barrels a day. International net liquids production – our main area of focus – increased for the ninth straight year, up 7 percent over 1997. We more than replaced this production with new reserves.

Return to Stockholders Percentage
Our worldwide refining, marketing and transportation operations also suffered because of the drop in demand, with earnings down nearly 27 percent from $1.029 billion in 1997 to $756 million in 1998. However, our U.S. operations posted strong profits for the second straight year, with earnings, excluding special items, of $633 million. This excellent perform- ance was boosted by increased gasoline sales and continual emphasis on reducing costs.
Industry overcapacity and the Asian eco- nomic slowdown also had a negative effect on our chemicals business. Earnings dropped from $224 million in 1997 to $151 million last year.
Report on stockholder return. Our five-year goal for 1994 through 1998 was to repeat as the major U.S. oil company with the highest total stockholder return. During this period, our total return – dividends plus stock appreciation – averaged 17.8 percent a year, putting us in second place if merger premiums are excluded. For the 10-year period 1989 through 1998, our total return of 18.4 percent a year puts us first, again discounting merger premiums. 1998 was our 11th straight year of dividend increases.
Putting oil prices into perspective.
During a period of low oil prices, it’s impor- tant to maintain perspective. Oil prices tend to be cyclical and to fluctuate within a range – as the chart (above right) shows. We’re now working through a period of prolonged over- supply – caused by a combination of increased production from OPEC and other areas – and reduced demand – caused largely by the Asian economic slowdown. This worldwide glut has driven down crude oil prices to the $11 to $13 a barrel range. It’s possible these conditions could persist for several years.

86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 Over time, crude oil prices rise and fall, driven by
the market forces of supply and demand.
But history strongly suggests that the economic forces of supply and demand will come back into balance, and prices will stabilize somewhere in the $15 to $20 a barrel range.
Chevron’s answer to low oil prices.
Our plans recognize the uncertainty and risk of continued low oil prices. Although this is a time of concern, it’s not a time to panic. I believe we have some of the best production growth prospects in the industry, and we plan to focus on taking advantage of them. These projects include:
• West Africa. Chevron continues to make major discoveries in the deepwater areas off- shore Angola, adding our third and fourth in 1998. We estimate that these four discover- ies total 3 billion barrels of potential reserves. Production grew in both Angola and Nigeria during 1998.
• Caspian Sea Region. After years of negotia- tions, we plan to start construction on the pipeline that will link the giant Tengiz oil field in Kazakhstan to a worldwide export market through the Russian port of Novorossiysk on the Black Sea. Completion of the 900-mile pipeline is scheduled for mid-2001. In 1998,

Tengiz production averaged a record 188,000 barrels of oil a day.
• Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron holds interests in 428 tracts in this promising U.S. area, and we intend to be a major player in its development. Our first deepwater field, Genesis, started production in January, and our second project, Gemini, is scheduled to flow first oil later this year.
To both fund these priority projects and maintain a strong balance sheet, we’ll have to sharply reduce spending in our international refining and marketing, and chemicals busi- nesses. We’ll also have to accelerate our cost- reduction efforts.
Planned 1999 spending reduced. Our planned capital and exploratory spending for 1999 is $5.1 billion, about 4 percent less than our 1998 spending. We plan to spend nearly $3.7 billion – 73 percent of the total budget – on worldwide exploration and production. About $2.6 billion of that will be outside the United States.
In addition, we’ll invest about $870 mil- lion in our worldwide refining, marketing and transportation activities. Finally, we’ll spend about $380 million in our worldwide chemicals business.
Cost reduction continues to be im- perative. Reducingcostshasbeenamajorpart of our strategy for years, and we’ve sliced more than $2.4 billion from operating expenses since 1991, including another $600 million in 1998. At the beginning of 1998, we set a goal to further reduce costs by 40 cents a bar- rel by 2000. We reached that goal by the end of 1998.
But now we must be even more cost- conscious. We’ve launched a special effort to reduce our cost structure by $500 million in
1999 and to implement additional sustainable savings in 2000 and beyond.
Mergers and acquisitions are big news.
1998 was a record-setting year for mergers and acquisitions in many industries, including ours. Two of the world’s biggest petroleum companies acquired major competitors. First, British Petroleum bought Amoco, and then Exxon announced plans to acquire Mobil. The most commonly quoted reasons – mergers are the best way to reduce costs, and increased size is the best way to improve competitiveness dur- ing this difficult business environment.
Clearly, the new and larger merged companies will become formidable com- petitors. However, I am convinced that Chev- ron has the size, scope, opportunities and people to compete with anyone. Size does not guarantee growth, which drives stockholder returns. Chevron has the best growth pros- pects in the industry, and we are confident about our future.
Chevron moves to strengthen com- petitive positon. This is not to say that Chevron is not continually looking at acqui- sitions and new ventures.
We have made several moves that have strengthened our competitive position and opened new opportunities. For instance, we acquired Amoco’s North American lubricants business, making Chevron the leading marketer of heavy-duty and industrial oils in North America. We also formed a joint venture with Texaco in the worldwide fuel oil and marine lubricants business.
We expect to complete the acquisition of the Rutherford-Moran Oil Corporation, which will give us access to an area offshore Thailand

and entry into that country’s natural gas mar- ket. In February 1999, we signed a preliminary agreement with ARCO to join the oil and natu- ral gas producing assets of our two companies in the Permian Basin of West Texas and south- east New Mexico. The planned joint venture will be more efficient and cost-effective. We will continue to consider any acquisition that will add value for Chevron’s stockholders.
Litigation causes earnings reduc- tion. We were shocked in early March by an Oklahoma Supreme Court opinion against Chevron in the Cities Service case that dates back to 1982. Even though the company plans to aggressively seek further review of this case in the courts, we recorded a special charge of $637 million to our 1998 earnings under accounting standards that require recognition of such potential losses.
Chevron is committed to protecting people and the environment. We con- tinue to make good progress toward our goal of having the best safety record among our peer competitors. Over the past five years, our recordable injury and illness incident rate is down 56 percent. I’d like to commend all our employees for this great improvement.
Chevron has long been recognized for its efforts to protect the environment – wherever it operates. Safeguarding the environment is an integral part of our day-to-day business phi- losophy. It’s the way we conduct our operations – whether in Texas or Kazakhstan, California or Angola. Our vigilance for health, safety and the environment can never be compromised. We demonstrate our commitment in many ways, including our company contributions, the volunteer efforts of employees, and the respect we show for different cultures and diverse peoples. Our consistent record for honest
and ethical behavior has made us the partner of choice around the world.
George Weyerhaeuser retires. I’d like to extend my deepest gratitude to George Weyerhaeuser, who is retiring from our Board of Directors after 22 years of service. George, who is Chairman of the Board of Weyer- haeuser Company, has been a tireless advo- cate for responsible resource management. We all will miss his wise counsel.
Employees give us an edge. Building a committed team of employees, which is our first strategic intent (see page 15), is more important than ever in these difficult times. It is their dedication, hard work and entrepre- neurial spirit that make it possible to accom- plish the other seven strategic intents. It is their creativity, willingness to try new things and to adapt to change that will enable us to continue to cut costs and find ever-more-effective ways to do business. Employees help make Chevron a strong, lean and nimble company able to successfully compete in today’s tough global environment.
I’m confident that we will be able to stay focused, to pursue our opportunities – which I think are the best in the industry – and to shape our future successes. In brief, I’m opti- mistic about Chevron’s future and about the long-term outlook for the industry.
