         Ameren ended the year 2000 with its best annual earnings performance ever. In short, we delivered on our promises to our owners and customers. Last year, we pledged to pursue these key strategies to return value to our shareholders:
As the rest of my letter to you will indicate, and as our earnings results for 2000
clearly show, we are delivering on these promises.

In 2000, our company recorded record earnings of $457 million, or $3.33 per share, compared to $385 million, or $2.81 per share, in 1999. In 2000, we reported a pretax nonrecurring charge of $25 million, or 11 cents per share, related to our withdrawal from the Midwest Independent System Operator. In 1999, we reported a pretax nonrecurring charge of $52 million, or 23 cents per share, related to terminating high cost coal contracts which resulted in future benefits. Excluding the impact of weather and the nonrecurring charges, we delivered a strong 9 percent increase in earnings per share in 2000 over 1999, exceeding our annual earnings per share growth target. In the years ahead, we will continue to target annual earnings per share growth of at least 5 percent.
The year also marked the transfer of five former AmerenCIPS power plants, representing 2,900 megawatts of generation, to a newly created nonregulated company, AmerenEnergy Generating Company. In the summer of 2000, we also added approximately 690 megawatts of new generation with the start-up of combustion turbine units. This additional capacity contributed to our ability to supply power to our new and existing customers, allowing us to cover our peak demand of approximately 11,640 megawatts a record set in August 2000. We are planning to expand our nonregulated generation by adding more than 2,300 megawatts of generating capacity by 2005. Nearly 850 megawatts of this total is expected to be installed for the 2001 summer season.
The year was also outstanding for our energy trading and marketing operations, which, in comparison with 1999 results, recorded increases in interchange and wholesale sales of 35% and 41%, respectively. In 2000, AmerenEnergy contributed an

In 2000, AmerenEnergy contributed an estimated 26 cents per share to our bottom line, double the per share contribution in 1999. We continued to grow our customer base in 2000 as we began supplying more than 375 megawatts of power to Soyland Power Cooperative through a multi-year contract in January. In August 2000, Archer Daniels Midland Illinois1 largest single electricity user became a 300-megawatt customer through a multi-year contract. Finally, in the fall, we contracted with, and began supplying power to, Illinois Energy Consortium. This contract covers 500 school buildings and 120 school districts in Illinois.
In 2000, we realized an estimated savings of $27 million, resulting from the 1999 termination of certain high cost coal contracts. We also successfully secured labor contracts that offer greater flexibility in our ability to tap the expertise and experience of a highly skilled workforce, thereby creating labor efficiencies. Ameren also became a founding member of Enporion, Inc., an Internet-based, global procurement exchange for the energy industry. This exchange promises to streamline the procurement process and reduce future purchasing costs, cycle times and inventories.
We continue to operate in a dynamic regulatory environment. Recently, we have been addressing the issues associated with the June 30, 2001, completion of our experimental alternative regulation plan in Missouri. On Feb. 1, 2001, we, along with other parties, submitted filings to the Missouri Public Service Commission on the merits of the current plan. We support an extension of this plan, with certain modifications, including retail electric rate reductions and additional customer credits. Other parties cited concerns with the current plan. We believe that the structure of the plan provides incentives for the company to improve its financial performance and equitably share those improvements with our shareholders and customers. In the months ahead, we will make every effort to work with the appropriate parties to reach a satisfactory resolution of this matter. We also recently announced our intention to withdraw from the Midwest Independent System Operator and to become a member of the Alliance Regional Transmission Organization a move that helps us ensure the continued reliable, efficient and profitable operation of our transmission system. This action is still subject to regulatory approvals.
We continue to explore alternatives for offering provider choice and to capitalize on competitive opportunities in newly opened markets, like Illinois, where a choice of providers is available now to all non-residential customers. We believe that it is prudent for Missouri to continue to explore the issues surrounding provider choice. We remain active in building a coalition to support legislation that would open the state to choice for the very largest retail electric customers. We remain committed to ensuring that any legislation passed in Missouri is fair and equitable to our shareholders and that it ensures reliable service to our customers.
For Ameren, 2000 was a year of action a year when we positioned the company to be successful in the rapidly changing energy industry. We have assembled the resources, people, product and service strengths to capture solid returns and enhance shareholder value.
For 2001 and beyond, we are moving forward with a focused strategy. The basics of that strategy are straightforward: 1) We will continue to capitalize on our low-cost generation and expand nonregulated generation in targeted locations across our region. 2) We will continue to capitalize on our unparalleled access to markets and our highly effective energy trading and marketing organizations. We are actively pursuing customers outside our traditional service area in Illinois and in other states where competition is a reality. 3) We will continue to manage our costs and improve our efficiency and productivity through Internet-based e-commerce solutions and through

In summary, we remain focused on returning value to our shareholders.
Finally, the year was also marked by the death of Charles J. Dougherty, retired chairman of Union Electric Company, now AmerenUE. He was 81 and an employee of Union Electric Company for more than 44 years when he retired as chairman of the board in 1985. Charlie Dougherty was a tremendous leader a man of exceptional character and integrity. He will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him.
             Thank you for being our shareholders.
