TO OUR INVESTORS
2013 was another exceptional year for Enterprise. We set a number of operating and financial records as we continued to benefit from increasing volumes through our pipelines, plants and facilities, driven by growing domestic energy production from shale plays and strong U.S. demand and growing international demand for natural gas liquids ("NGLs"), petrochemicals and refined products from crude oil.
Our 51,000-mile, integrated pipeline system transported a record five million barrels per day ("BPD") of NGLs, crude oil, refined products and petrochemicals, and 13.6 billion cubic feet per day ("Bcf/d") of natural gas in 2013. Our NGL fractionators, which separate NGLs into their purity products, averaged a record 726,000 BPD, and our natural gas processing facilities had record fee-based volumes of 4.6 Bcf/d in 2013.

NGL FRACTIONATORS
We announced that the eighth NGL fractionator at our Mont Belvieu complex was placed in service in November 2013. This new unit increases total NGL fractionation capacity at the complex to approximately 670 MBPD. This fractionator, along with a seventh unit placed into service in September 2013, was designed to handle increasing NGL production from shale plays, including the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and other supply basins. We operate our seventh and eighth NGL fractionators which are owned by a joint venture between us and Western Gas Partners, an affiliate of Anadarko.

ECHO STORAGE
We announced plans to significantly expand the crude oil storage capacity at our Enterprise Crude Houston ("ECHO") storage facility to approximately 6.5 MMBbls by second quarter 2015. We also plan to construct 55 miles of associated pipelines to directly connect the ECHO storage facility with several major refineries in the Southeast Texas market. This expansion will take advantage of the growing crude oil supplies and changing flows from U.S., Canada, and waterborne sources.

TEXAS EXPRESS PIPELINE
Our Texas Express Pipeline, which commenced operations in November 2013, extends approximately 580 miles from Skellytown, Texas to Mont Belvieu, Texas. This pipeline gives producers in West and Central Texas, the Rocky Mountains, southern Oklahoma, the Mid-Continent and the Denver-Julesburg supply basin much needed takeaway capacity for growing NGL production volumes and improved access to Mont Belvieu, the primary industry hub for domestic NGL production. The pipeline is a joint venture among us, Anadarko, DCP, and Enbridge.

DISTRIBUTABLE CASH FLOW (2)

RECORD FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN 2013
Enterprise reported record gross operating margin of $4.8 billion in 2013, as four of our five business segments reported increases in gross operating margin compared to 2012. The ten percent improvement in gross operating margin was primarily a result of increased volumes across our system and new assets added to our midstream energy platform. During 2013, we successfully completed and began operations of major growth projects totaling $2.3 billion in investment, with most of these projects completed on or under budget and on time or ahead of schedule. These projects included:
the third natural gas processing train at our Yoakum complex in South Texas, which serves the Eagle Ford Shale; new NGL and crude oil pipelines to transport Eagle Ford Shale production to markets on the Texas Gulf Coast; our seventh and eighth NGL fractionators at Mont Belvieu, Texas; 750,000 barrels of crude oil storage capacity at our ECHO facility in Houston; the expansion of our Liquefied Petroleum Gas ("LPG") export facility on the Houston Ship Channel; the jointly owned Texas Express NGL pipeline which transports NGLs from shale plays in the Permian, Granite Wash and Barnett to our complex in Mont Belvieu; and completing the reversal of our jointly-owned Seaway Crude Oil Pipeline.

DISTRIBUTIONS DECLARED

Enterprise generated distributable cash flow of $3.8 billion in 2013, which provided 1.5 times coverage of the cash distributions with respect to 2013. After adjusting for non-recurring items in 2013 and 2012, distributable cash flow for 2013 would have been $3.6 billion, or a 18 percent increase compared to 2012. We retained $1.3 billion, or 34 percent, of distributable cash flow in 2013 to reinvest in the growth of the partnership, enhance our financial flexibility, reduce our need to issue equity and insulate our partners from earnings variability. Since our formation, we have retained $6.6 billion, or 30 percent of Enterprise's distributable cash flow. In January 2014, we declared a $0.70/unit quarterly cash distribution with respect to the fourth quarter of 2013. That was the 38th consecutive quarter in which Enterprise has increased its cash distribution rate to its partners, the longest period for any publicly traded energy partnership. Since our initial public offering in 1998, we have increased the quarterly cash distribution 47 times by an average of 7 percent per year.

CAPITAL PROJECTS SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH
At the beginning of 2014, we had $7.8 billion of growth capital projects under construction slated to begin operations during the next two years. Approximately $4.9 billion of these projects are scheduled to begin service in 2014 alone. We completed $2.3 billion of these capital projects during the first two months of 2014, which included :

Currently, the ATEX Express pipeline is the only pipeline option for producers in the Marcellus and Utica shale plays to transport ethane south to the Gulf Coast. Enterprise's network of pipelines, which includes ATEX Express, connects to 100 percent of U.S. ethylene production capacity in the U.S. Ethylene crackers are the sole consumers of ethane. Customers have executed 15-year transportation agreements for 131,000 BPD of capacity which will ramp up over a five-year period beginning in 2014. Initial throughput capacity for the ATEX Express pipeline is 125,000 BPD, which could be expanded up to approximately 265,000 BPD without adding new pipe. These assets, underwritten with long-term contracts, are expected to generate new sources of fee-based cash flow. We believe these investments will produce attractive returns on capital that will support future distribution increases for our partners.

SAFETY & ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS
As we grow, we continue to emphasize the importance of safety and protecting our environment. At Enterprise, safety is our highest priority. We believe safe and reliable operations are important in assuring the wellbeing of our employees, contractors, neighbors and assets. We reinforce this commitment by investing in our employees and providing them with the resources they need. Our commitment is exemplified in our daily message: "No task is so important that it be done at the risk of safety." The wellbeing and protection of the environment is also a key focus for Enterprise. Our success depends on the ability to operate in an environmentally responsible manner that does not adversely impact our neighbors, the communities in which we operate or the environment at large. Good environmental stewardship is not just important; it is a way of doing business at Enterprise.

In 2010, we eliminated our general partner's incentive distribution rights, which significantly lowered our longterm cost of capital and enhanced the potential accretion to our limited partners generated by future investments. Enterprise's successful history of developing and operating energy infrastructure combined with our large footprint of midstream energy assets, the untiring efforts of our commercial and engineering teams, the U.S. shale energy revolution and a manufacturing renaissance drive an ongoing pipeline of organic growth opportunities. We believe the potential returns on capital from these projects will be attractive and superior to those available in the current acquisition market. In closing, we continue to pursue attractive total returns for our limited partners through our disciplined approach to investments and continued execution. We rely on our dedicated employees to prudently manage our assets and execute our growth plans. Finally, we would like to thank our debt and equity investors for your consistent support throughout our first fifteen years as a publicly-traded partnership.

NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES (GAAP)

Our Letter to Investors includes the non-generally accepted accounting principle ("non-GAAP") financial measures of gross operating margin, distributable cash flow and adjusted EBITDA. This Letter to Investors provides reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures such as net income, operating income, net cash flows provided by operating activities or any other GAAP measure of liquidity or financial performance.

non-refundable revenues that may be deferred under GAAP related to make-up rights, to be important in assessing their financial performance. From a GAAP perspective, the revenue streams associated with these make-up rights are deferred until the earlier of (i) the deficiency volumes are shipped, (ii) the contractual make-up period expires or (iii) the pipeline is released from its performance obligation. Since management includes such deferred revenues in non-GAAP gross operating margin, these amounts are deducted in determining GAAP-based operating income. Our consolidated revenues do not reflect any deferred revenues until the conditions for recognizing such revenues are met in accordance with GAAP. Management expects that several of our new pipeline projects, including the ATEX, Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline, will experience periods where shippers are unable to meet their contractual minimum volume commitments during 2014. We anticipate that committed shipper transportation volumes on the ATEX may be negatively impacted by producer drilling programs, including the timing of new production well start-ups in the Marcellus and Utica Shale developments. With respect to the Texas Express Pipeline and Front Range Pipeline, we expect that ethane rejection in the supply basins served by these pipelines will adversely impact shipper transportation volumes.

GROSS OPERATING MARGIN
We evaluate segment performance based on the non-GAAP financial measure of gross operating margin. Gross operating margin (either in total or by individual segment) is an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations. This measure forms the basis of our internal financial reporting and is used by our executive management in deciding how to allocate capital resources among business segments. We believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating segment results. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to total segment gross operating margin is operating income. In total, gross operating margin represents operating income exclusive of (1) depreciation, amortization and accretion expenses; (2) impairment charges, (3) gains and losses attributable to asset sales and insurance recoveries and (4) general and administrative costs. As discussed below, gross operating margin includes equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates and non-refundable deferred transportation revenues relating to the make-up rights of committed shippers associated with certain pipelines. Gross operating margin by segment is calculated by subtracting segment operating costs and expenses (net of the adjustments noted above) from segment revenues, with both segment totals before the elimination of intercompany transactions. In accordance with GAAP, intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Gross operating margin is exclusive of other income and expense transactions, income taxes, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and extraordinary charges. Gross operating margin is presented on a 100 percent basis before any allocation of earnings to noncontrolling interests. We include equity in income of unconsolidated affiliates in our measurement of segment gross operating margin and operating income. Equity investments with industry partners are a significant component of our business strategy. They are a means by which we conduct our operations to align our interests with those of customers and/or suppliers. This method of operation enables us to achieve favorable economies of scale relative to the level of investment and business risk assumed. Many of these businesses perform supporting or complementary roles to our other midstream business operations. Management includes deferred transportation revenues relating to the make-up rights of committed shippers when reviewing the financial results of certain major new pipeline projects such as the Texas Express Pipeline and Seaway Pipeline. Certain shippers on these systems did not meet their minimum volume commitment beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, thus revenues associated with each shipper's make-up rights were deferred in accordance with GAAP. From an internal (and segment) reporting standpoint, management considers the transportation fees paid by committed shippers on major new pipeline projects, including any

DISTRIBUTABLE CASH FLOW
Our management compares the distributable cash flow we generate to the cash distributions we expect to pay our partners. Using this metric, management computes our distribution coverage ratio. Distributable cash flow is an important non-GAAP financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flows at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distributions. Distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships because the value of a partnership unit is, in part, measured by its yield, which is based on the amount of cash distributions a partnership can pay to a unitholder. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net cash flows provided by operating activities.

ADJUSTED EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is commonly used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and rating agencies, to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structures or historical cost basis; the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest and support our indebtedness; and the viability of projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities. Since adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income or loss and because these measures may vary among other companies, the adjusted EBITDA data presented in this press release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net cash flows provided by operating activities.

PUBLICLY TRADED PARTNERSHIP ATTRIBUTES Enterprise is a publicly traded limited partnership, which operates in the following ways that are different from a publicly traded stock corporation: Unitholders own limited partnership units instead of shares of common stock and receive cash distributions rather than dividends. A partnership generally is not a taxable entity and does not pay federal income taxes. All of the annual income, gains, losses, deductions or credits flow through the partnership to the unitholders on a per unit basis. The unitholders are required to report their allocated share of these amounts on their income tax returns whether or not any cash distributions are paid by the partnership to its unitholders. Cash distributions paid by a partnership to a unitholder are generally not taxable, unless the amount of any cash distributed is in excess of the unitholder's adjusted basis in their partnership interest.
