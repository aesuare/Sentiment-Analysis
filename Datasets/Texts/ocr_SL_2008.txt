FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
The year 2008 was one in which we sought to restore growth, improve profitability and enhance shareholder value. We implemented strategies to mitigate the
challenges of Medicare Part D, to capitalize on a rapidly changing pharmaceutical marketplace, to reverse trends in the number of beds served and to effect a major process-reengineering in our business model. The successful execution of our strategies produced improvement throughout the year — culminating in sales growth, expanded margins, sequentially increasing earnings and a return to year-over-year growth in the latter half of the year. And, despite turmoil in the financial markets, this performance allowed us to deliver enhanced shareholder value.
attractive acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, complete a $100 million stock repurchase program and reduce our debt position. But for one additional weekly payment of $65 million made to our primary drug wholesaler due solely to how the calendar fell in 2008, this level of operating cash flow would have been similar to the record operating cash flow of $505.5 million achieved in 2007.
During 2008, we repaid $92 million in debt and at December 31, 2008 had $217 million in cash on our balance sheet. Our total debt to total capital at December 31, 2008 was 44.4%, down approximately 180 basis points from year-end 2007.
PHARMACY SERVICES
Our pharmacy services sales grew to $6.1 billion in 2008, reflecting primarily expansion in specialty pharmacy services, the contribution of drug price inflation and the increased utilization of certain higher acuity drugs and biologic agents. These factors more than offset the impact of a greater mix of generic drugs on our sales and a lower net number of beds served, as well as reductions in utilization or reimbursement for certain drugs.
Adjusted operating profit for the full year 2008 increased 22% to $633.4 million versus $518.9 million in 2007. Even aside from the incremental provision for bad debt, 2008 adjusted operating profit was above the prior year, largely as a result of our growing contribution from generics, drug price inflation,

in 2007. Excluding special items (but including the incremental provision for doubtful accounts), 2008 adjusted EBITDA rose 20% to $653.4 million as compared with $542.9 million in the prior year.
We also continued to generate strong cash flow. Cash flow from operations reached $438.2 million in 2008, allowing us to pursue

 our productivity and cost-reduction initiatives, including savings attributable to our Full Potential Plan, and margin expansion in our specialty and hospice pharmacy businesses.
At December 31, 2008, we served long-term care facilities and other chronic care settings comprising approximately 1,435,000 beds, including 68,000 patients served under patient assistance programs. While our net number of beds served was modestly lower year- over-year, we made solid progress

in our customer development and retention efforts throughout 2008, ultimately resulting in sequential net bed growth in the fourth quarter of 2008.
CONTRACT RESEARCH
Our contract research business (CRO) recorded a 4% increase in revenues to $203.3 million as compared with $195.1 million in 2007. Reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses in 2008 and 2007 totaled $31.3 million and $31.7 million, respectively. Excluding such expenses, adjusted CRO revenues for the full-year 2008 increased 5% to $172.0 million as compared with $163.4 million in 2007. Adjusted operating profit in 2008 was up 34% to $17.6 million versus
$13.1 million in 2007. Backlog at December 31, 2008 was $303 million.
Despite a more challenging operating environment for the CRO industry, notable growth among our biotechnology clients continued, and our vigilance in managing costs produced strong operating profit growth for the year.
OPPORTUNITY IN A DYNAMIC MARKETPLACE Our business has benefited increasingly from certain trends that have emerged in the pharmaceutical marketplace. In light of the rising costs of healthcare, generic drug alternatives are more important than ever. During 2008, we and our customers and payors continued to benefit from the increasing availability of generics. Four years ago, the number of generic prescriptions we dispensed was only slightly higher than our branded dispensing rate. In 2008, alone, we increased our generic dispensing rate significantly, ending the year dispensing nearly 72% of our prescriptions in generic form.
We are also looking forward to the potential introduction in 2009 of several new branded drugs targeted at the chronic conditions common in the patients we serve. These include new treatments for diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and stroke prevention.
The pharmaceutical industry is also being shaped by the advent of drugs known as “biologics”. These highly intricate drugs have become increasingly employed in the treatment of such disease states as multiple sclerosis, cancer and
Throughout 2008, we implemented strategies and made investments in initiatives that we believe will drive growth, improve profitability and

rheumatoid arthritis. As more and more of these drugs move into the mainstream, we are seeing increased utilization in our long- term care population, which we believe bodes well for growth in our core business and for improvement in patient care.
In 2008, we further capitalized on the opportunity to leverage our assets and skill sets in this rapidly growing sector. In July, we acquired Advanced Care Scripts (ACS), which expanded our presence in the specialty pharmacy market. Centered largely on specialized pharmacy services and support programs for multiple sclerosis and oncology, ACS complements our existing specialty pharmacy business and significant- ly expands our position in this market. In fact, at the time of its acquisition, ACS was generating annualized revenues of approximately $237 million; less than six months later, the business was operating at an annualized rate of nearly $300 million in revenues. We view our presence in the specialty pharmacy business as an attractive opportunity to extend Omnicare’s reach beyond its traditional institutional markets.
LEVERAGING OUR OPERATIONAL STRENGTHS
Throughout 2008, we implemented strategies and made investments in initiatives that we believe will drive growth, improve profitability and enhance shareholder value. The results of these efforts were reflected in the substantial progress
we made operationally as well as financially during the year.
Since mid-2007, we put in place new sales management, nearly doubled the size of the sales force and initiated programs to enhance the effectiveness of our sales team. We have also invested in training and increased incentives for our pharmacy operations designed to increase net bed growth and have added marketing resources to reinforce the value proposition that Omnicare brings to its customers. The results have been encouraging. In fact, new contract signings in 2008 were 30% higher than in the prior year.
We recognize the value of complementing our effective sales force with a service-minded customer retention group. We doubled the size of this specialized retention team in 2008 and our
investment produced substantial returns. This group retained approximately 48,000 beds, or more than triple the number of beds it retained in the prior year. Moreover, these client accounts represented approximately
$250 million in annualized revenues retained, or 4% of total pharmacy services revenues. We plan to continue adding high-caliber individuals to this team to support our retention and renewal efforts in 2009.
Our retention team has been running in tandem with our organization-wide effort to enhance service levels. We have invested in training and development programs for a wide range of our employees who interface with customers in a number of different ways. In addition to our focus on organic growth, we have the most active acquisition program in the industry, and 2008 was no
4
 
 exception. Due to our scale and scope, we are a logical partner to those seeking greater resources and efficiencies, particularly in today’s economic environment. In 2008, we acquired and integrated 11 institutional pharmacy businesses.
We have also been successful in leveraging our geriatric expertise in the rapidly growing assisted living market, where we increased our presence during 2008. This market is particularly attractive because we not only have the opportunity to increase the number of communities we serve, but we also have room to grow the number of residents we serve within our existing client communities.
In addition to the progress we have made in expanding our market reach, we have increased our purchasing effectiveness across the entire organization. During 2008, we implemented new strategies and developed new tools to enhance our pharmaceutical purchasing efficiency, particularly in the generics market. Moreover, we successfully met our $40 million goal in negotiated savings on non- drug purchases throughout the organization. We have already set our sights on 2009, when we expect to make continued progress on this
strategic sourcing initiative by further utilizing our size and scale.
REACHING OUR FULL POTENTIAL
Perhaps the most far-reaching of our strategic initiatives is our Full Potential Plan. It is transforming how Omnicare addresses the institutional pharmacy business and we believe it will substantially raise the bar in efficiency and customer service for years to come.
The Omnicare Full Potential Plan enhances our business model by leveraging our size and scale to drive further efficiency and reduce costs, while optimizing our assets and resources across the company. This important initiative builds upon innovative technology and is organized around best practices, a hub-and-spoke operational model, and net customer growth. In 2008, we achieved important operational and financial milestones under the Full Potential Plan.
In 2008, we built-out 22 of our 30 hubs, with 20 that are providing either order-entry or prescription- filling activities for more than 50 local pharmacies. We have also completed nine of the 10 regional back offices, or billing and collection centers, which are billing claims in a more timely and accurate manner. This can reduce receivables, while improving customer satisfaction.
At the start of 2008, we had only begun to receive the automation equipment required to support this major initiative. One year later, we
have installed more than 86% of the automation equipment we plan to employ. We are already processing prescriptions at a rate in line with targeted levels for both the MTS OnDemand II and our proprietary Auto-Label & Verify (ALV) machines. This equipment has greatly improved dispensing accuracy, which has garnered the approval of State Pharmacy Boards as well as our customers.
Another important aspect of the Full Potential Plan is document imaging. In 2008, we moved from the planning stages to having more than 40 pharmacies equipped with document imaging today. This digital imaging software eliminates much of the paper-intensive nature of the business. It also allows us to balance workflow, increasing efficiency and flexibility while enhancing customer responsive- ness.
Importantly, we have begun to realize a financial return from our Full Potential Plan. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we generated savings from this program at an annualized rate of approximately $26 million, or more than 20% of the $100-$120 million in targeted annual savings we expect to achieve upon completion of the program.
We are also proud to have increased our customer retention rate during the year, even while undertaking this far-reaching program. This progress gives us confidence in the longer-term goal of the Full Potential Plan – which is net customer growth.
Omnicare, we believe, is uniquely positioned in our industry to look at innovative ways to enhance our business model, allowing us to foster and successfully leverage our growth — to reach our full potential.

aged 65 or older. By 2020, little more than 10 years from now, that number is expected to increase by 38% to 55 million and by 2040, to exceed 80 million, or approximately double the number of those over 65 today. And given our market position and scale advantages, we
In closing, I would like to express our sorrow with the passing of our esteemed friend, colleague and Chairman Emeritus of Omnicare, Edward L. Hutton. Mr. Hutton was instrumental in the creation of Omnicare in 1981. He served as Chairman of the company from 1981 until May 2003, and as Chairman of the Board until February 2008, when he became Chairman Emeritus. Mr. Hutton’s wisdom and dedication have been critical to the success of his many business and philanthropic ventures. His insights and guidance have had an indelible and positive impact on our company and on all who knew him. He was an extraordinary man. We will miss him.
We look forward to continued progress in 2009. We plan to use our scale and clinical expertise to increase our market penetration in our core business, while progressively building upon our presence in adjacent markets. We believe this focus will continue to position Omnicare to enhance shareholder value.

WELL POSITIONED FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH
The fundamentals underpinning our industry support long-term growth. In contrast to the global economy, the institutional pharmacy business has remained relatively stable due to its nature as an essential healthcare service. Moreover, as we look ahead, demand in our industry will be largely driven by demographic trends in the elderly, which are projected to rise substantially over the next three decades. Today there are nearly 40 million Americans
believe we are well positioned to serve this increasing demand.
While stock prices in this economic environment have been subject to much volatility, in 2008, your investment in Omnicare significantly outperformed both the healthcare sector and the broader market. Additionally, we were pleased to have executed a $100 million stock repurchase program, returning additional capital to shareholders beyond our quarterly dividend.
