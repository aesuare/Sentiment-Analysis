To our
shareholders:
 2008 was an exceedingly difficult year for many Americans, as unemployment increased sharply, housing values dropped dramatically, and retirement portfolios were hard hit by precipitous stock market declines. The nation began 2009 deeply mired in a yearlong recession.
The slowing economy has had far-reaching effects on our customers. The economy will continue to create hardships for consumers, both residential and commercial. More people are going to need help managing their bills, and we are going to assist them.
Despite these trying times, I am optimistic that we will witness a turnaround in the local and national economies. My confidence stems from the vibrancy of our region.
The New York metropolitan area has one of the nation’s most dynamic economies. In the five years leading up to the recession, the city outperformed the nation by creating a quarter-million new jobs, almost all of them outside of the financial-service industry. New York City’s population has grown by more than 260,000 in less
than 10 years.
In areas such as technology, innovation, and intellectual capital, New York City ranked first among 20 cities in a recent worldwide survey. New York City attracted 47 million tourists in 2008, and remains the most popular destination in our nation. The city’s public-transit system is the largest in North America, and New York is home to renowned educational institutions and extensive healthcare and social-services segments, all adding to a vital economy. We can expect that the city’s underlying strengths will continue to attract the best people and businesses, and drive increases in the demand for power.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The current economic slowdown, however, will directly impact future demand for electricity. In January, we reduced our forecast for peak energy growth from ten to seven percent over the next decade.
Our EnergyNY plan is a blueprint for meeting the region’s increasing need for energy. The plan balances energy-efficiency initiatives with infrastructure investments to meet our region’s demand for power in an environmentally responsible manner.
EnergyNY
Lowering Demand, Increasing Efficiency
Energy efficiency is expected to be a key part of the nation’s strategy to address climate change. Energy efficiency is also more critical than ever in these trying economic times. When our customers save energy, it is good for their bottom line, and good for the environment. EnergyNY gives our customers the tools to better manage their energy use and reduce costs.
Through our energy-efficiency programs, we help customers install new lighting, and heating and cooling systems to reduce energy use. In 2008, we worked with Modell’s Sporting Goods to replace the conventional light bulbs at their flagship store in Times Square. Modell’s Sporting Goods’ investment nearly paid for itself in the first year through lower electric bills.
Another energy-efficiency program helped raise the environmental profile of one of New York’s largest tourist attractions. The Intrepid Air and Space Museum upgraded its lighting to cut energy use
by more than 650,000 kilowatt-hours annually, a project overseen by Con Edison Solutions, our energy-service company. Our energy-efficiency efforts not only help customers manage energy use, but will ultimately enable us to defer $230 million in capital investments through 2012.

We enlist hundreds of large residential and commercial customers to temporarily reduce their energy use on the hottest summer days upon request. Participants receive financial incentives for their cooperation. The organizations that signed up last year allowed us to realize a 40-percent increase in potential energy savings.
Our Power of Green campaign is a key initiative that educates our customers so they become smarter consumers of energy. The campaign promotes weatherization, insulation, and other practical energy-saving tips through our Web site, brochures, newsletters, newspapers, radio spots, and subway posters.
Our energy-efficiency programs coincide with ambitious national and local plans for energy initiatives. The White House has announced its intention to develop a new national energy policy. President Obama is proposing modernizing the nation’s
electric grid, and promoting clean energy. Governor Paterson
has a goal of meeting 45 percent of the state’s electricity needs through energy efficiency and renewable sources by 2015. Mayor Bloomberg plans to reduce local government’s carbon footprint by 30 percent by 2017. The mayor has pledged to create green jobs by investing $900 million to retrofit schools, hospitals, and government offices with new energy-efficient systems.
EnergyNY
Investing in Our Future
We know that the growing demand for energy cannot be satisfied by efficiency measures alone, which is why EnergyNY provides for continuous investment in our energy infrastructure. Con Edison’s capital programs are upgrading, strengthening, and modernizing our energy-delivery systems. Providing world-class

 service reliability has been the hallmark of our company and we know how vital that mission is for our customers.
Over the next three years, we plan to invest $7.3 billion to build, replace, and upgrade systems. Last year alone, we invested $2.3 billion in infrastructure improvements.
In 2008, Con Edison of New York energized two new substations in upper Manhattan and Westchester County. We also began construction on a 10-mile, high-voltage underground transmission line that will run from Yonkers to upper Manhattan. Orange and Rockland Utilities (O&R) rebuilt its Monroe substation, quadrupling the transformer capacity to meet current and future electric demand.
A smart grid pilot project in Rockland County is paving the way for “intelligent” networks with advanced sensors, field devices, on-line decision-making software, and improved communications. O&R’s state-of-the-art system will increase reliability and automatically restore power after service interruptions.
We must build today to meet tomorrow’s energy needs. Continued growth in energy demand will require the construction of thirteen new substations over the next three years. To meet our customers’ future energy needs, we will continue to work with regulators and stakeholders to maintain and update our rate plans. A capital-intensive industry like ours requires access to financial markets on reasonable terms.

 EnergyNY Keeping Green – An Ongoing Story
The final component of EnergyNY is the company’s long- standing obligation to a cleaner environment. We are continually focused on lowering greenhouse gas emissions and have reduced the company’s carbon footprint by more than 30 percent since 2005.
And because Con Edison is a user of energy as well as a provider, we examined our own consumption patterns. In 2008, we installed our first green roof on our Learning Center in
Long Island City, in cooperation with Columbia University’s Center for Climate Systems Research. Thousands of small plants are growing on a quarter of an acre of the roof, keeping the building cooler and reducing the need for air-conditioning.
New York City’s skyline grew greener when we installed energy- efficient lighting in the tower of our corporate headquarters. At night, the tower uses 63 percent less energy than conventional lighting, lowering carbon emissions. The new lights also last up to 15 years, reducing maintenance costs.
We’ve reached out to proponents of a cleaner environment in the metropolitan area. Con Edison enjoys close relationships with 150 local community and conservation groups. We are proud to be a leading benefactor of the New York Botanical Garden and a sponsor of their Greening the Garden program.
More trees are growing and fewer greenhouse gases are emitted as a result of the 10 million electronic customer payments processed last year. In addition to saving trees through increased electronic transactions, we’ve planted 7,000 new trees to thank customers who signed up for paperless billing.
 6 CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT

 We will continue to recognize the importance of work related to conservancy, recycling, and reducing pollution. We’re pleased to report considerable recognition for our environmental efforts.
In May, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recognized Con Edison of New York for replacing oil-filled lead cable with state-of-the-art nonleaded cable. Removing lead cable is a good business practice that also benefits the environment.
The company was cited in two recent rankings for addressing climate change. In a 2008 survey by Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Consolidated Edison, Inc., placed second in North America and fourth internationally among 26 utilities. We were also ranked third among S&P 500 utilities in the worldwide Carbon Disclosure Project’s yearly rankings. O&R received the Tree Line USA Award from the National Arbor Day Foundation for the seventh consecutive year.
We are expanding our presence in national energy-efficiency markets through Con Edison Solutions. Solutions increased
its green-customer portfolio by more than 45 percent in 2008. Solutions acquired Custom Energy Services in Kansas, and won approval from the U.S. departments of Energy and Defense to provide energy-efficiency services at federally owned facilities across the nation.
We are continuing to explore the promise of renewable energy. In a joint effort with the Long Island Power Authority, we are studying the feasibility of constructing a wind-turbine farm several miles off the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens.
We take our environmental responsibilities seriously and will continue to pursue more opportunities to green the way we do business for a more sustainable future.
