To our shareholders: The economic and market turmoil of 2008 left virtually no company or individual investor unscathed. It was the worst year for equity markets since the 1930s. Credit markets deteriorated dramatically and, late in the year, essentially froze, with many banks unable to provide critical funding. Major financial institutions failed, while others were acquired at severely distressed prices. The federal government committed hundreds of billions of dollars to help stabilize the financial system. As the crisis spread across industries, consumers and companies retrenched, and the U.S. economic recession deepened. Despite this broad dislocation, at Ameriprise Financial, our business remains sound. The actions we've taken since becoming an independent public company in 2005 --as well as the knowledge gained through our 114-year history-- have positioned us well to withstand the current environment. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet, including a high-quality, diversified asset portfolio and a strong capital position. In fact, unlike many of our competitors, we did not need to raise capital in 2008. We finished the year with $700 million in excess capital and $6.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents-- even after committing $600 million to share repurchases, increasing our dividend and completing three all-cash acquisitions for a total of $800 million. Our conservative risk management has allowed us to protect our franchise while focusing on executing our strategy and investing in our long-term opportunity. We were not, however, immune to the environment in 2008. Client assets decreased along with the markets,

lowering fee revenue. As our clients sought safety, their desire for conservative investment products, as well as their reduced activity, further impacted our revenue. Credit market instability resulted in impairments to our investment portfolio. And we took necessary steps to position the company for our lower 2009 market expectations, which led to significant non-cash charges late in the year. These market forces drove our $38 million loss for the full year. While our results were disappointing, I am encouraged by the continued strength of our business model. At the heart of our company are long-lasting, personal and deep client-advisor relationships. These relationships remain as strong as ever, for many reasons: because of the excellent support we provide to advisors and clients; because of our advisors' personal commitment to their clients; because of our unique comprehensive approach to financial planning; and because our broad and innovative product offerings provide a range of solutions to meet clients' goals. Our advisor support continues to be extensive. Early in the year, we brought about 8,000 of our advisors to our Minneapolis headquarters for training to help them deliver a more consistent and compelling client experience by using new products, services and technology. As the markets deteriorated later in the year, we developed a new online market resource center to help advisors provide current information to their clients. In addition, we broadened market resources and perspectives on our public website. As a result of these and other efforts, our client retention remains strong and our advisor retention is at an all-time high.

The severe volatility and weakness in financial markets has vastly increased the demands on our advisors' expertise and time. By drawing upon the resources we provided, as well as their own unwavering commitment to their clients, our advisors succeeded at helping clients comprehend the environment and maintain their focus on the long term. Our advisors' efforts strengthened client relationships despite the tough market conditions and eroding consumer trust in the financial system. Market events required that we take dramatic action on behalf of our clients in 2008. In September, following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy filing, Reserve Management Co. allowed one of its money market funds to "break the buck," or post a net asset value below $1 per share. The Reserve subsequently froze redemptions from its funds, affecting millions of individual investors. Approximately 300,000 of our clients had invested their cash--funds many clients used to pay routine expenses--in Reserve money market funds. We promptly stepped up for clients: We advanced affected clients approximately $400 million to help meet their immediate cash needs; we advocated on their behalf with legislators, regulators and through litigation; and we committed to mitigate client losses in the impaired fund. We were driven in these actions, as always, by our steadfast dedication to our clients and their long-term financial planning needs. Our approach to planning is particularly relevant in today's turbulent environment. At Ameriprise, we assess not only a client's financial situation; we gain a full understanding of our clients'

lives so we can help them plan for the long term. This approach has proven resilient and valuable: Today we are the leading financial planning firm in the U.S. Comprehensive financial planning requires a broad and diverse set of products to help meet wide-ranging client needs. Our advisors have extensive product choice, from cash management and lending to investments, insurance and annuities. In 2008, many of our clients sought the safety of cash or other liquid or fixed-interest-rate products. The resulting shift from wrap accounts, variable annuities and mutual funds to FDIC-insured banking products, certificates and fixed annuities impacted our asset flows and profitability. Importantly, our product diversity allowed us to retain client assets--and maintain a leading share of wallet. We recognize that the investment landscape is everchanging, so innovation and flexibility are critical to our ongoing ability to serve clients. We have transformed our product platform over the past several years, highlighted by the launch of advice-embedded solutions that provide individual investors with access to sophisticated investing techniques within appropriate risk parameters. These products have been well received; we now hold $30 billion in assets in advice-embedded solutions, up from $7 billion just three years ago. In addition, we believe insurance can play a central role in comprehensive planning and provide an additional measure of security in uncertain times. In 2008, our life insurance in force increased by

3 percent as clients continued to recognize the importance of protecting what matters most. Our client-centered business model and commitment to financial planning deliver many benefits to the company and our shareholders, including diversity of revenue and long-term stability. While our results suffered with the markets in 2008, we see great potential for our approach: Current market forces are increasing consumers' awareness of--and desire for--comprehensive financial planning and advice, just as the baby boomer generation begins to retire. While we continue to invest for organic growth--we invested approximately $240 million in medium- to longterm business growth in 2008 --we are also capturing other opportunities. We added H&R Block Financial Advisors and Brecek & Young Advisors to our advisor platforms, and supplemented our asset management business with the addition of J. & W. Seligman. The H&R Block Financial Advisors acquisition brought us a productive and tenured force of 950 advisors and provided an opportunity for us to revamp our employee advisor group. While that work continues, we believe we will have a more efficient employee advisor platform that will produce stronger economic returns. The Brecek & Young acquisition added approximately 300 independent advisors, bringing our advisor force to about 12,500, the nation's fourth-largest. The acquisition of J. & W. Seligman added approximately $13 billion in assets, including $3 billion in hedge funds, and brought us strong investment teams, particularly

in technology, value and growth. We're confident that these strong performers will contribute to overall improvements in our RiverSource® investment performance, which struggled in 2008. In addition, Seligman's extensive distribution capabilities and relationships significantly enhance our ability to distribute RiverSource products outside our advisor force. Our ability to seize these opportunities amid the exceptionally challenging conditions highlights the value and importance of our strong capital position, which helped us withstand the numerous adverse market events during the year. Still, our investment portfolio was not immune to the market environment-- we recorded $777 million in net realized losses during the year. While this is substantial, our overall loss position compared favorably to peer companies as a percentage of either equity or assets. We take a conservative approach to valuing assets and have the ability to hold investments to maturity, which we believe will allow us to recover a substantial portion of these losses over time. We expect the market and economic challenges to persist in 2009 and have taken action to prepare for short-term weakness while preserving our long-term potential. As we continue to execute our strategy, integrate our recent acquisitions and invest for future growth, we also have accelerated our re-engineering efforts, both in the U.S. and at Threadneedle in the U.K. We intend to reduce pre-acquisition general and administrative expenses by approximately 10 percent in 2009; this is on top of the significant reduction we achieved in 2008. As is appropriate in the current

In addition to our financial and management strengths, our business is underpinned by a deeply talented and dedicated group of senior leaders and employees; together we continue to stress careful decision-making and service to our clients and advisors. Our employees remain energized and committed, and I am grateful for their diligent efforts during this challenging year. I am confident that the company is positioned to withstand the recession and to rebound when markets and the economy improve. In the meantime, we remain focused on executing our strategy and seizing targeted opportunities for growth. Our client-advisor relationships remain strong and our financial planning-based model has been reinforced. On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to thank you, our shareholders, for your perseverance through these difficult markets. While 2008 was a year of profound challenge and change, I believe we will emerge from this period a strong company that continues to be worthy of your investment. We will continue to do all we can to earn and reward your trust. Sincerely,

James M. Cracchiolo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
