Dear Shareholders The global economic crisis, healthcare reform initiatives around the world and dynamics in the plasma proteins market created signi?cant headwinds for Baxter in 2010. Despite these challenges, the company also enjoyed many  accomplishments. We introduced existing products into new geographies, launched a number of new products and made signi?cant progress on key research and development (R&D) programs in 2010. Baxterís increased R&D investment in recent years resulted  in 14 R&D projects in Phase III clinical trials in 2010 compared to just two in 2006. We entered into a number of new business partnerships, expanding our product portfolio  and enhancing our own scienti?c capabilities. Our Medication Delivery and Renal businesses were combined into a single global business unit, Medical Products, aligning common areas of capability within Baxter while creating increased capacity to pursue new growth opportunities. We continued to invest in our communities, again earning recognition for our sustainability performance. And, Baxter launched a global re-engineering initiative across the company  with the goal of strengthening our focus on disciplined innovation, commercial effectiveness, operational excellence, organizational effectiveness and accelerated growth. These efforts allowed us to weather the headwinds in 2010, and we ended the year a stronger company. We are now ready to enter the next phase in our evolution. 
Market Challenges Follow Period of Strong Growth During the period from 2005 to 2010, Baxter delivered shareholder returns that signi?cantly outpaced the Dow Jones, S&P and S&P Healthcare indices. We addressed critical legacy issues, rebuilt our ?nancial strength and established credibility with our investor base. We demonstrated steady and reliable sales growth, grew earnings faster than sales, and dramatically increased our investment in R&D, building a pipeline for the future that is the strongest in Baxterís history. Several factors challenged our business in 2010. In March, sweeping healthcare reform legislation was passed in the United States seeking to increase access to care for people without insurance and reduce long-term healthcare costs. Provisions most signi?cant to Baxter include modi?cations to Medicaid rebates and expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which provides certain quali?ed entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchases of drugs for outpatient use. The legislation also will require the company to pay taxes on the sale of pharmaceutical products beginning in 2011, and on certain medical devices beginning in 2013. Healthcare reform initiatives outside the United States, a global economic crisis that continued to slow GDP growth around the world and increased pressure in the plasma proteins market also affected our business. In April 2010, we revised our ?nancial guidance for the year primarily to re?ect the impact of U.S. healthcare reform and dynamics in the plasma proteins market. While the plasma proteins market has improved, this new external environment will be with us for the long term. We took a number of measures ñ strategic and organizational ñ in 2010 to meet these challenges and position ourselves for the next phase  of Baxterís growth.
2010 Financial Highlights In 2010, Baxterís worldwide sales increased 2 percent, totaling $12.8 billion, including a ?rst-quarter revenue adjustment of $213 million associated with the U.S. recall of our COLLEAGUE Volumetric Infusion Pump. Excluding the COLLEAGUE charge, Baxterís worldwide sales totaled $13.1 billion, an increase of  4 percent over prior year.2 The company reported net income of $1.4 billion, or $2.39 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.2 billion, or $3.59 per diluted share, in 2009. On an adjusted basis, excluding special charges in both years, Baxterís net income in 2010  was $2.4 billion, which represents an increase of 2 percent over 2009, while earnings per diluted share of $3.98 increased  5 percent from $3.80 reported in 2009.
We delivered record cash ?ow and returned signi?cant  value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases in 2010. Cash ?ow from operations totaled $3.0 billion (including pension contributions of $350 million to  the companyís U.S. pension fund during the year). Excluding pension contributions made during the last two years, cash ?ow from operations increased 11 percent in 2010 versus 2009. In addition, Baxter returned approximately $2.1 billion to shareholders through dividends totaling $688 million and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion (or 30 million shares).
2010 Business Highlights Baxter realized a number of signi?cant accomplishments in 2010 that will support future growth. The company: ?9edj_dk[Zje_dYh[Wi[iWb[ie\7:L7J;Q7dj_^[cef^_b_Y Factor (Recombinant) Plasma/Albumin-Free Method], our leading recombinant factor VIII therapy for hemophilia A.

Sustainability Performance As Iíve said many times, being a great company requires  more than ?nancial success. It requires being a responsible corporate citizen, making a difference beyond our business  in communities around the world. We view sustainability  as our approach to including our social, economic and environmental responsibilities among our business priorities. These efforts align with and support our mission of saving  and sustaining lives. Baxter continues to be recognized for its sustainability performance. In 2010, Baxter was: ?DWc[Zjej^[:em@ed[iIkijW_dWX_b_jo?dZ[n\ehj^[ 12th straight year and the Medical Products Industry Leader for the ninth time. ?H[Ye]d_p[ZWied[e\j^[«=beXWb'&&CeijIkijW_dWXb[ Corporationsî by Corporate Knights Inc., a Canada-based media company focused on sustainable development.

Many of our individual facilities around the world also received recognition for environmental excellence, employee health and safety, community involvement and volunteerism. In addition, Baxter donated hundreds of thousands of IV solutions and other products to assist earthquake victims in Haiti, as well as victims of a subsequent cholera outbreak  in that country, as part of the companyís global disaster-relief efforts in 2010.
Entering a New Phase in Baxterís Growth Moving into 2011 and beyond, Baxter will continue to bene?t from its diversi?ed healthcare model, broad portfolio of products that treat life-threatening conditions, and global presence.
Baxter enters 2011 positioned well for the future. Iím looking forward to seeing our R&D investments come to fruition in the years ahead, resulting in new products and therapies that will improve clinical outcomes.
The companyís geographic scope enables Baxter to meet global healthcare needs, including those of developing markets, where many patients with critical conditions remain undertreated. As the economies of such countries develop, they increase funding for healthcare at an even faster rate, starting with life-threatening diseases and conditions such as those for which we provide products and therapies. Geographic expansion will continue to contribute to Baxterís long-term growth. Our strong ?nancial position provides the resources to grow our investment in R&D and continue to pursue business development opportunities that are consistent with our mission of saving and sustaining lives, and that complement existing businesses, allowing us to expand our market leadership. Through continued innovation, investment and collaboration, we seek to advance new therapies, improve the safety and cost-effectiveness of treatments, and expand access to care.
Baxter enters 2011 positioned well for the future. Iím looking forward to seeing our R&D investments come to fruition in  the years ahead, resulting in new products and therapies that will improve clinical outcomes. Many of these innovations  will also reduce total healthcare costs, which is particularly critical in an increasingly cost-constrained environment. We have a strong global brand, market-leading positions in virtually all of our businesses, and our products treat conditions that are largely non-discretionary, providing ongoing, sustainable demand. The company has responded to an evolving and challenging environment with new strategies, organizational changes and programs aimed at enhancing our commercial, operational and scienti?c effectiveness. As a result, we have strengthened our foundation and remain con?dent in the long-term growth prospects of the company. Our nearly 48,000 employees worldwide share this con?dence and enthusiasm for our future. I look forward to reporting next year on our continued progress.
