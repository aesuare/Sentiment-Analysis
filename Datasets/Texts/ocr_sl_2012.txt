Dear Stockholders, Customers & Employees
During 2012, Omnicare began transforming our operating structure to better meet our long-term objectives, while driving significant year-over-year growth. We generated double-digit adjusted cash earnings per share growth in every quarter and have been focused on building the right structure for sustainable organic growth. As part of this effort, our team has been focused on the operational basics that will help Omnicare become more efficient and successful.
Here is a brief summary of how we performed:
We delivered adjusted cash earnings per share of $3.36—up 15.9% over the previous year.
We generated $544 million of cash from continuing operations.
We returned $434 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, marking a 176% increase over the amount returned in 2011.

                A Road Map to the Future
We believe we have realigned our business to lead in a new era of healthcare to enable our customers to benefit from the comprehensive capabilities and value we offer. In the year ahead, we will continue our focus on the three key operational objectives that are essential to our long-term success:
Establish consistent net organic growth within our Long-Term Care Group through sales and operational alignment and increased script count
Continue growth momentum in our Specialty Care Group through consistent innovation and operating discipline in a rapidly growing market
Continue efficient capital allocation through strong cash flow generation, flexible capital structure and focus on returning value to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases
We are encouraged by the progress we have already made towards achieving these objectives since standardizing our approach to operations. Our new senior leadership is fully aligned to better achieve these key priorities.
Establish Organic Growth within
the Long-Term Care Group
Within our Long-Term Care Group, we have moved quickly and with a sense of urgency to implement a multi-phased operating plan to drive greater results. We believe we have a substantial opportunity to build organic growth in Long-Term Care by better leveraging our assets and scale to drive volume and efficiency realizations. Near the end of 2012, we initiated a sales transformation strategy that encompasses a revamped organizational structure, the redeployment of
resources toward high potential markets, and the optimization of sales tools to enhance our selling effectiveness. We exited the year with a greater urgency toward enhancing service levels.
Overall, customer retention has improved over the last two years, yet we believe we can generate even further improvement with more consistent service delivery across our network. While most of our regional service areas have been performing at or above the company average, service was inconsistent and some areas are underperforming. As a result, we have moved quickly to deploy
a plan to concentrate our efforts in these areas
and monitor their progress. With our focus on controllable losses due to quality of service or other metrics we can influence, we are creating a system in which there is joint accountability with groups working effectively together.
We have a substantial opportunity to build organic growth in Long-Term Care

Efficient Capital Allocation
Omnicare’s robust cash flow generation provides us with a distinct opportunity to create value for our shareholders. In 2012, we took several steps to allocate capital in ways that resulted in greater shareholder value. In fact, we returned more than $434 million in capital, or nearly 80% of operating cash flows, to shareholders through dividend payments and stock repurchases.
Late in 2012, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase for $250 million, bringing total share repurchases for the year to $389 million, or 10 million shares, which represents 8.8%
of our outstanding shares at the start of 2012. We have increased our quarterly dividend four times since 2010, from $0.02 to $0.14 per share. As always, we look to maintain a balanced approach to our capital allocation strategy, which includes the pursuit of high-quality acquisitions accretive to earnings, making capital investments to support our long-term growth objectives, and returning value to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases.
Our Specialty Care Group, which we formed
two years ago, has become a significant growth driver and is well positioned to continue its growth trajectory. In 2012, the Specialty Care Group delivered 24% top-line growth, outpacing the market and gaining share, a reflection of the investments we have made over the course of the past two years.
The Specialty Care Group touches a broad spectrum of the healthcare continuum, serving the needs of biopharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, nurses, caregivers and patients. The specialty care industry is outpacing the broader pharmaceutical industry, and we believe we are well positioned to maximize our opportunities within this rapidly growing market.
We are also actively developing new solutions
for our biopharma clients through our specialty pharmacy platform through limited distribution networks. One unique example is the drug Xenazine, where we have utilized our long-term care footprint to become the exclusive provider of Xenazine within the long-term care channel. We will continue to evaluate opportunities like this to better leverage our assets, and with both of

                Relevant Value Proposition
We are enhancing the effectiveness of the chain that we believe will create tremendous value for our stockholders, for our company and for the many constituents across the healthcare continuum that we touch every day.
This value proposition is enhanced in an environment where every healthcare company has a role to play in reducing the rate of increase for our country’s healthcare spending and
in improving patient outcomes. We believe
the most effective means of minimizing the healthcare cost trend involves increasing access to appropriate drug therapy, and we believe we are well positioned to ensure compliance with this objective through our many diverse operating platforms.
Our efficiency at converting long-term care residents to lower cost generic alternatives represents a compelling opportunity for both our stockholders and customers. Because our size enables us to buy lower-cost generic medications directly from manufacturers, we will continue to benefit from the number of important patents
on brand name drugs that expire over the next few years, allowing manufacturers to produce an equivalent low-cost generic version of such drugs. We believe we are fully aligned with our customers and payors because when we benefit from lower- cost generic alternatives and pass along the cost savings, they also benefit.
Similarly, we have solutions to the many supply chain, reimbursement and administration
 challenges that prohibit patients from accessing life-saving specialty drug products. We bring an integrated set of services to our clients to ensure there is appropriate coordination from the time

                a physician prescribes a drug to the time the patient receives their medication. We believe this coordinated effort
improves the level of adherence for these patients, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions.
Across all of our
platforms, we
believe we have the
best offering in our
respective marketplaces
when considering our
clinical expertise, technology,
and distribution capabilities. By
improving our ability to identify the
highest priority needs of our customers and the broad mix of patient populations we touch with our seven diverse operating platforms, we believe we can be even more effective in growing our customer base.
Looking Ahead
As we move forward, we are confident that we will continue to successfully execute our

core strategies. Omnicare has a tremendous team of more than
14,000 employees who are dedicated to improving
the quality of patient care through essential
pharmaceutical services amid a rapidly
changing healthcare landscape. Since joining Omnicare,
each of us has developed a strong
appreciation for our businesses and of the
challenges and opportunities ahead of us. We will strive
to drive growth and improve the quality of life of the residents and
patients we serve across the country, leading with our Core Values of Excellence, Integrity, Service and Compassion.
We remain confident that we are taking the right actions to create value for you, our stockholders. Thank you for your continued trust in us and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2013.
