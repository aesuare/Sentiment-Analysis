Toour shareholders
2012 was another strong year for the people of 3M. In an uncertain economic environment, we kept our promises to our customers and investors while building an even stronger future for 3M. For me personally as the chief executive officer of 3M, it was a year in which I grew to appreciate more than ever the many strengths of the company and the tremendous talents of our people.
Early in the year we introduced a new vision for 3M, a vision for the entire company to inspire our employees and position us positively with our customers. We set out to capture the essence of 3M with a clear vision that is both timely and timeless.
I shared it with the leadership team on my first day as CEO and with all employees worldwide a few days later. We introduced it early to connect immediately with employees and to send a very clear message about 3M’s direction, purpose and future. You can see it on the cover of this year’s annual report.

                 Our Vision
3M Technology Advancing Every Company 3M Products Enhancing Every Home 3M Innovation Improving Every Life
Our vision captures well the essence of 3M: technology, products and innovation. It describes what we do for our customers every day: advance, enhance and improve. And, it sets a stretch goal for all of us: we have the capability to reach every company, every home and every life all around the world.
From a performance standpoint, if we can make good progress toward realizing our vision, we can look forward to many more good quarters and many more years of increasing value for our shareholders.
The vision has inspired and excited our employees, and it was especially encouraging to see how our customers have responded. Whenever I meet with customers I make a special point to share our vision. Not only does it resonate very well with them, it generates even more interest in our technologies and products.
Concurrent with the vision, we introduced six strategies to propel the company forward. While top-down at launch, the strategies were developed and enhanced through
a process involving literally hundreds of 3M leaders. In less than six months from introduction, our people transformed the strategies from concept into clarity, credibility and confidence.
– Expand Relevance to our Customers and our Presence in the Marketplace
– Gain Profitable Market Share and Accelerate Market Penetration Everywhere
– Invest in Innovation: Invigorate Existing Market Opportunities and Focus on Emerging Megatrends
– Intensify Capabilities to Achieve Regional Self-Sufficiency
– Build High Performing and Diverse Global Talent
– Drive Consistent Superior Levels of Operational Excellence
The strategies formed the basis of a great deal of 2012 progress across the company. For example, we aligned the organization to become more relevant and responsive
to our customers. We recommitted the company to increased funding of innovation. We improved our ability to drive growth through new capabilities in marketing, sales, and e-platforms. We strengthened our operational excellence through more focus on
