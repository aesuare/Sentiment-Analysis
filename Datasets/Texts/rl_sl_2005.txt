dear fellow shareholders
I am pleased to once again report a strong year for Polo Ralph Lauren. This was a year of many accomplishments and important beginnings. Our performance continues to reinforce our multi-year strategy of combining world-class design and marketing with equally strong operations. The future of our Company has never been brighter. The excitement for me is in leading. I love the challenge of building new worlds, whether it be a new collection, a new brand, a new store, a new concept. When we see an opportunity, we act on it. We execute our ideas with enthusiasm and precision, resulting in success. Our Ralph Lauren brands represent superior quality design and craftsmanship. We know our customers, and our unmatched ability to anticipate their desires makes us their premier brand worldwide. Everything we do has a clear point of view -- with focus, with consistency, with heritage. We have thoughtfully built our brands over more than 37 years to epitomize lifestyle luxury for men, women, children and home all around the world. We continue to invest in our business. Our childrenswear acquisition is exceeding our expectations in North America, and we are moving forward with international expansion plans. We introduced Black Label for men this year -- a collection that reflects the essence of modern elegance heralding a new chapter in men's style and complementing our Polo and Purple Label brands. Our women's business has never been better. The launch of our Women's Collection and Black Label pre-lines has been extremely well received by our customers. And this spring our enormously successful Lauren for women brand marked its first anniversary under our full ownership and control. We will continue to focus new energy on the development of a luxury accessories line. We are very excited about this new long-term growth prospect for the Company. The expansion of our specialty retail business continues. We opened eight Ralph Lauren stores this year and plan to open ten more next year. Our Ralph Lauren stores carry our message and our vision directly to our customers, and they truly value the unique shopping experience. Our spectacular Milan flagship opened last fall establishing a new level of international sophistication and glamour. It is a showcase of what we have to offer from men's to women's to accessories to home. It has carried the Ralph Lauren dream to new heights, increasing the demand for our brand throughout Europe and setting the stage for an even greater presence there that rivals other international luxury names. We will continue our international expansion in Asia by opening a flagship store in Tokyo next year. This will create a statement in Japan that will advance the world of Ralph Lauren in this important part of the market where quality and design are highly valued.

I am very excited about Rugby, our new full-lifestyle collection for young men and women. The Rugby line adds a whole new dimension to our retail strategy. It is our first vertical concept started from scratch and reflects my sensibility from start to finish. It has a cooler, hipper attitude and is available only at our freestanding Rugby stores, where we can control the shopping experience and maximize the connection to our customer. Over time, Rugby has the potential to expand into new product categories and to grow internationally. We believe Rugby is the next Polo. I am also pleased with our expanding online world. Polo.com is a virtual showcase featuring extraordinary product and marketing innovations that let customers live the world of Ralph Lauren. The Company is financially robust. We manage our balance sheet conservatively, maintaining the right inventory levels, and we are doing $1 billion more in sales on the same level of inventory we had four years ago. Financial flexibility is one of our hallmarks. This strength has enabled us to execute our multi-year initiatives with confidence. The investment we make in our operations and in our people is critical to our future success. This year we upgraded our executive talent in retail, wholesale and finance, and we have built a world-class management team with a depth of experience in all areas of our business. We have also established global programs to identify and develop the talent we need to seize the opportunities ahead of us. As a successful company, an important part of our culture is giving back to the communities where we live and work. Our employees around the world rallied to support the tsunami relief efforts through a matching gift program. Other programs include the Pink Pony initiative in the fight against cancer. And in May the Ralph Lauren Center for Cancer Care and Prevention in Harlem, a joint venture between Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and North General Hospital, celebrated its second anniversary. We have an extensive volunteer program with hundreds of our employees donating their time to dozens of worthy programs. Helping others is part of the heritage of what this Company stands for. My name is on the label, but it's all of us together that make this Company great. Every day our people demonstrate their commitment to making Polo Ralph Lauren the one-of-a-kind Company it continually proves itself to be. I thank our Board for its guidance and support. And I thank every one of our employees around the world for their important role in our success.
