  LETTER TO STOCKHOLDERS
 In a year of unprecedented economic volatility and uncertainty, when a financial crisis devastated some of the best-known corporations, AMERIGROUP remained strong. Our Company faced formidable challenges – quite a few not foreseen when 2008 began – and delivered exceptional value to those we serve, surpassing many of the goals we set a year earlier.
Financially, we responded effectively to market conditions and an extremely challenging fiscal environment, preserving our balance sheet and achieving better-than-expected earnings.
Operationally, we continued to expand into new states and markets. We strengthened our technology capabilities and support infrastructure, improving our capacity to serve our members and affiliated healthcare providers. We also carefully controlled costs, helping the government agencies we work with to conserve scarce resources and manage their programs wisely.
Most important, as we have done throughout our history, we continued to make a difference in the lives of the people we serve, bringing quality healthcare to the financially vulnerable, frail elderly and people with disabilities.
We increased our capacity to serve people enrolled in Medicaid and other publicly funded healthcare programs throughout 2008, most notably by joining with the State of New Mexico to launch the innovative Coordination of Long-Term Services (CoLTs) program. This groundbreaking program helps
people with serious health problems get better care, while simultaneously controlling the cost of that care for taxpayers.
New Mexico selected AMERIGROUP to inaugurate its CoLTs program because of our track record of meeting the health needs of vulnerable populations. We are proud that our operations there are off to a solid start and that our Company is a leader in serving individuals who can benefit from coordinated long-term care.
We grew in other states as well. In Florida, we were selected to expand our role in its Children’s Health Insurance Program. In late 2008, the State of Nevada asked us to enter its Medicaid program.
I’m especially proud that in 2008 the people of AMERIGROUP reached out to help the communities in which we operate. Though we have quite a compelling history of this type of service, last year we took it to another level. Volunteers from our Company formed the AMERIGROUP Disaster Response Team and assisted the victims of hurricanes and other natural disasters in Texas, Georgia and Tennessee. Time and again, our 4,000 associates have demonstrated an inherent spirit of volunteerism – and genuine belief in helping the vulnerable populations we serve – that drives us to make a difference
in healthcare today. Perhaps it is this spirit that led us to be named among the “Best Places to Work in Healthcare” by Modern Healthcare magazine in 2008. Truly, there is a blend of both passion and compassion in the work we do.
As 2009 begins, our Nation’s economy continues to struggle, and our political leaders are initiating efforts to overhaul
our healthcare system. The recent elections indicate that
the Nation is ready for the type of healthcare changes we
at AMERIGROUP have been implementing for nearly 15 years. With our track record of offering innovative healthcare solutions, we believe AMERIGROUP is well-positioned to impact the lives of even more Americans, increasing access and improving the quality of care while serving states and the Federal government in a fiscally responsible manner.
As we approach our 15th year, the demand for AMERIGROUP’s expertise and the services we offer – plus the genuine desire to assist those in need – has never been greater. We believe that 2009 could present our Company with some of its biggest opportunities, and we look forward to a year of significant achievements.
