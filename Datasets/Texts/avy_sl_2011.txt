Letter to Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholders: Avery Dennison faced several significant challenges in 2011, including more than $200 million of raw material inflation and a sudden downshift in volume in the second quarter that lasted the rest of the year. We were able to more than offset these challenges through increased productivity and price increases. We also generated nearly $300 million of free cash flow, which allowed us to further reduce leverage, contribute to our pension plan and increase our dividend. However, the fact is that we did not deliver the growth in sales, net income and free cash flow we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. We know we can do better, and we are focused in 2012 on execution -- meeting our goals for sales, earnings and free cash flow and delivering more value to shareholders despite continued economic uncertainty and volatility.

A More Focused Portfolio During 2011 we reached agreement on the sale of our Office and Consumer Products (OCP) business, including the Avery® brand, for $550 million. The agreement is consistent with our strategy to maximize OCP's value for shareholders, and we intend to use the net proceeds to return cash to you through share repurchases as well as to reduce our debt and pension liability. With the sale, which we anticipate completing in the second half of 2012, we will exit what has been a major line of business for Avery Dennison for 30 years. However, our vision -- to make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent -- does not change; how we fulfill that vision becomes clearer.

With our expertise in materials science, high-speed web-based manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, packaging and graphic design, we serve a large number of vertical markets, including consumer packaged goods, apparel and other soft goods, transportation, durable goods and health care. The products and solutions we deliver help make brands more compelling and persuasive, enabling our end user customers to differentiate their products and sell more. We also help customers move those products quickly and efficiently throughout their supply chains with our bar code, RFID and other information management solutions. Our two primary businesses -- Pressure-sensitive Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions -- are industry leaders with significant competitive advantages. Our global footprint enables us to produce goods to the same high standard, and deliver them rapidly, everywhere in the world. Being more than twice as large as their competitors, our core businesses enjoy economies of scale that allow us to purchase materials more efficiently. We are leading innovators in our industries. We have a strong presence in emerging markets and we expect these markets to be a major driver of future sales and profit growth. In addition, our culture of productivity, based on Enterprise Lean Sigma (ELS) and world-class supply chain and sourcing teams, delivers industry-leading levels of quality, reliability and service to our customers. ELS also fosters working capital efficiency. The strong free cash flow that results enables us to reinvest in our businesses and return significant cash to shareholders. Label and Packaging Materials (LPM), the larger of the two businesses in the Pressure-sensitive Materials segment, has differentiated products, especially in the faster-growing film categories. LPM is an industry leader in innovation. Last year LPM introduced almost 20 new products to accelerate profitable growth and extend our leadership in key market segments over the mid to long term. Our plan is for LPM to grow faster while maintaining its strong returns. We'll capture additional growth by introducing new solutions for end users in our target vertical markets, such as Avery Dennison Shrink PS for food labeling and Global MDO film for home and personal care products.

Our other pressure-sensitive materials business, Graphics and Reflective Solutions (GRS), has grown sales by improving customer service and product quality. Enhanced innovation is also paying off for this business: last year, more than half of GRS sales growth came from its line of cast films, which consists entirely of new or reformulated products. Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS) is the leading global provider of branding and supply chain solutions for the retail apparel industry. With interconnected facilities in more than 40 countries, RBIS can ensure the quality and consistency of branding on apparel that is manufactured all over the world. RBIS also offers solutions combining labeling and advanced mobile technology to ensure inventory accuracy and enable "just-in-time" pricing speed and accuracy, two enormous benefits for retailers seeking to avoid markdowns and out-of-stocks in order to expand operating margins. The apparel market has seen periods of exceptional volatility in the last three years. In 2009, sales of our products dropped when retailers reduced inventories in response to the global recession. After a strong rebound in 2010, we experienced lower unit volumes in 2011 as record input costs caused retailers to raise prices. Going forward, our strategy will be to lower fixed costs so we can earn solid returns despite the volatility of the retail market. We'll do that by accelerating productivity, outsourcing certain product categories and consolidating our manufacturing footprint. We will grow our business by continuing to lead apparel industry adoption of RFID tagging, which, by enabling our customers to operate with more precise inventories, allows them to increase sales and lower their costs. Our apparelrelated RFID sales grew more than 60 percent last year as we continued to demonstrate clear market leadership. In addition, our materials science capability has produced a line of new heat transfer products with which customers can create high-definition graphics on a wide range of apparel items. We expect sales of these new products to grow significantly this year.

Finally, we continue to invest in serving new end markets for apparel, including Japan, Brazil, Russia, China and India. High-value branding and information solutions are needed in these markets, and with limited investment we can capture market share by leveraging our extensive global network. Complementing our core businesses is a diverse set of specialty converting businesses that extend our core competencies into other markets. A good example is our Medical Solutions business, which is using our expertise in adhesives to develop new attachment systems for medical devices and innovative wound dressings. Our goal is to improve returns of these businesses and grow them faster, particularly in emerging markets, where we have enormous growth potential. Innovation and Sustainability Innovation that solves customers' problems can garner premium pricing, accelerate top-line growth and extend our competitive advantage. Many of the products we introduced last year help customers and end users become more sustainable. For example, LPM's Global MDO labeling film delivers twice as many labels per roll as the current standard product and has a fully recyclable liner, resulting in 40 percent less solid waste. Avery Dennison ThinStreamTM film, which has the thinnest liner yet, reached full commercial availability as we collaborated with equipment maker Gallus to introduce the specialized equipment required to print and die-cut this revolutionary material. RBIS also introduced "greener" apparel packaging and fasteners made from recycled materials. Just as sustainability has become a key element of many of our customers' brands, we are rapidly making it part of our own. Our first full corporate sustainability report details the progress we have made in products, processes and purpose, and I encourage you to read it at www.averydennison.com/sustainability. In addition, LPM earned the 2011 Environmental Leadership Award from the Tag and Label Manufacturers Institute, the leading North American industry association. And we have set the ambitious goal of sending zero waste to landfills from our facilities, which would eliminate the equivalent of more than 1,500 large truckloads of waste going to landfills each year.

Avery Dennison Corporation 2011 Annual Report

Letter to Shareholders

Transitions In 2011, Director Debra L. Reed resigned from the board after becoming CEO of Sempra Energy. Debra provided valuable insights, and we wish her success in her new leadership role. Joining the board is Charles H. Noski, vice chairman of Bank of America Corporation. He brings exceptional experience as the chief financial officer and director of major global financial services, telecommunications and aerospace companies, and we are already benefiting from his expertise. The year also brought the passing of Charles D. Miller, our former chairman and CEO. Chuck's impact on Avery Dennison was immeasurable. Every aspect of our company has been shaped for the better by his vision, passion and imagination, and his legacy will be felt for years to come. Moving Forward Although we delivered disappointing results in 2011, we accelerated productivity actions and continued to invest in innovations to create near-term growth. While the economic environment remains uncertain, we are committed to delivering growth, improving returns and increasing returns of cash to you. The entire Avery Dennison team is focused on execution in 2012.
