dearcustomers, employees and shareholders, It’s always a pleasure to share good news. Here are a few highlights from 2005, an incredible year for Nordstrom:
• Total sales increased 8.3% to $7.7 billion and same-store (comparable) sales increased 6% — our fourth consecutive year of same-store sales gains
• Our SG&A rate (expenses as a percentage of net sales) improved for the fifth consecutive year, with our lowest SG&A rate in over 10 years
• Reaching new heights, we topped our 2004 best-ever gross margin performance in 2005, marking the fourth consecutive year of gross margin improvement
• Our pre-tax margin improved for the third consecutive year — at 11.5%, it is at the highest level in our company’s history and ranks in our industry’s top tier
We’ve achieved significant progress over the last three years in improving our company’s operating efficiency. While we will continue to see some improvement in this area, moving into 2006, we are strategically positioned and focused on exceeding $8 billion in sales and continuing to improve our pre-tax margin, SG&A and same-store sales.
Our long-term strategy is to drive profitable growth by earning more business from the customers we currently have, serving more customers, and increasing our presence where our customers shop. There are a number of reasons why we believe now is an opportune time to take the next step forward. Here’s a snapshot of the potential that lies ahead:
maximizing women’s apparel
We’ve pinpointed Women’s Apparel as key to increasing our share of our customers’ spending. This merchandise category has great potential in relation to total company sales and we’re laying the groundwork in 2006 to make it an even stronger part of our business. We are approaching this effort from the perspective of the customer — combining feedback from our selling floor with objective demographic data — to gain a clearer picture of how we can better serve our customers. Being competitive in this category requires a blend of art (merchandising talent) and science (operational efficiencies). To that end, we’ve carefully reorganized our merchant teams, and we’re leveraging our system tools in an effort to identify market opportunities and react to them quickly.
a seamless shopping experience
Early on, our focus in Direct — our catalog and online business — was to promptly get up to speed with the growing trend of online shopping. Now that we have a foundation to build upon, we have fine-tuned our approach to better serve all our customers. We’ve learned already that customers who have a multi-channel relationship with Nordstrom spend four times as much with us as those who do not. We believe that by offering our customers a consistent “Nordstrom experience” — whether they shop with us by phone, online or in our stores — we’ll attract new customers, many of whom will eventually become loyal to Nordstrom Full-Line stores.
Last fall we introduced new Nordstrom catalogs, which closely mirror the merchandise assortment in our stores and are designed
to inspire customers to shop with us along whichever “path” they prefer. We’re also making a substantial investment in our Web site, which is now more robust and easier to use. And on the horizon, system upgrades will enable us to have a single view of inventory, ultimately providing a seamless customer experience.
      
                    expansion opportunities
One big story, in terms of expansion, is our entry into the Boston market. Other than Manhattan, Boston is the last major U.S. metropolitan market where we do not have a presence. Starting with Natick Mall, we will open four stores in the Boston area between 2007 and 2010.
Another great opportunity, due to the changing retail landscape around us, is the availability of desirable real estate. We anticipate more clarity on specific sites and markets available to us by year’s end. Our primary expansion focus remains on Full-Line stores, be they in new or existing markets. In 2005, we opened four new Full-Line stores: Phipps Plaza in Atlanta, Georgia; The Shops at La Cantera in San Antonio, Texas; Irvine Spectrum Center in Irvine, California; and NorthPark Center in Dallas, Texas. In March of 2006, we opened a 144,000-square-foot store at The Gardens Mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Also this fall, we’ll be opening a new 200,000-square-foot store at Westfield Shoppingtown Topanga in Canoga Park, California (a relocation of our 154,000-square-foot Topanga store that opened in 1984), and a Nordstrom Rack at Grand Plaza in San Marcos, California.
We believe one of our greatest competitive advantages is our ongoing commitment to allocating appropriate spending for store remodels. This year we are designating approximately 30% of our capital spending to remodeling existing stores. Our ultimate objective is to make the Nordstrom experience the best it can be for all our customers.
continuous improvement
As a fashion specialty store, we’ve always believed in trying new things and taking calculated risks in order to be competitive. Here are a few recent changes we believe will enhance the Nordstrom experience.
• Last August, Nordstrom purchased a majority interest in Jeffrey, a luxury specialty retailer with designer boutiques in New York City and Atlanta, and named its founder, President and CEO, Jeffrey Kalinsky, Director of Designer Merchandising at Nordstrom. We’re utilizing Jeffrey’s expertise and creativity in the designer business to further our current designer strategies and complement the incredible job our merchant team has been doing.
• In select stores we’re testing new shop concepts. Examples include trend accessories, featuring unique jewelry and handbags, and designer “shop-in-shops,” housing notable designer collections.
• We’re finding new ways to give our customers what they want. One example is our customized men’s shirt program, which allows a customer to sit down with a salesperson, in front of a computer, and essentially build his own shirt.
• In February, we launched our designer Web site on nordstrom.com. The site features photography, plus illustration and animation by Ruben Toledo which, together, showcase a boulevard of 10 designer shops that mirror the look and feel of each designer’s collection.
• Our $350 million investment in technology over the last several years continues to reap dividends. In the last five years, we’ve gone from catching up to industry parity to a point where we’re starting to strategically get ahead. We’re now leveraging our technical foundation with new software applications that offer substantial potential at incremental costs.
  
      • Personal Book has continued to evolve as a sales tool. This clientele software helps our salespeople track their customers’ personal preferences, giving those who utilize it a more comprehensive service relationship with their customers, resulting in increased business.
• Markdown Optimization, a new tool implemented last fall, has helped us leverage our Perpetual Inventory System. Simply put, Markdown Optimization makes recommendations based on the science of retail. If, for example, an item is not moving well, it may suggest we mark it down sooner than we normally would. So in essence, it gives us another way to analyze our inventory, a huge dollar investment for our company.
As you can see, there is a lot going on at Nordstrom. Many of the initiatives are long-term in nature, designed to deliver lasting benefits. Throughout these changes we’ve been incredibly proud of our people and how they’ve adapted to new technology and built on the momentum of the last few years. In 2005, we were honored to be included among Fortune magazine’s “100 Best Companies to Work For in America” for the ninth time. We are especially proud of this recognition, as we’ve always strived to create a positive environment for our employees, one that allows them to deliver great service and achieve their own goals.
Finally, we wish to extend a deep and heartfelt thanks to Bruce and John Nordstrom, both of whom are retiring from the Board of Directors this year after 40 years of service. As most of you know, these men are part of the third generation leadership team — along with Jack McMillan and the late Jim Nordstrom — who guided our company from a small Northwest retailer to a leading national specialty store. These four took the company public in 1971 and continued to share leadership responsibilities for Nordstrom as co-chairmen until 1995 (Bruce reassumed his position as Chairman of the Board in September 2000). Under their watch, Nordstrom grew from an $80 million company in 1971 to nearly an $8 billion company today.
Both Bruce and John exemplify the characteristics of their grandfather — and our founder — John W. Nordstrom. Their hard work, persistence, honesty, competitive spirit and unwavering commitment to the customer not only reflect the highest of standards, but set examples worth following — and building upon. We’re grateful for their lasting contributions and will continue to call on their expertise from time to time.
On behalf of our executive team, I’d like to personally thank you for your continued support. We enthusiastically look forward to 2006 as we build on the progress we’ve made toward our goal of being the industry leader.
Blake W. Nordstrom
President, Nordstrom, Inc.
