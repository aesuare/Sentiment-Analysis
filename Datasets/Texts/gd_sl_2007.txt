Letter to Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholder, Your company enjoyed a terrific 2007. Sales, operating earnings, net earnings, cash flow from operations, orders and backlog surpassed any previous year in the company's history. The market responded accordingly. Shareholders received a share price increase of 19.7 percent and a total return of 21.3 percent. Revenues were $27.2 billion, a 13 percent increase over 2006. Each of our business groups contributed to this year's strong top-line performance, led by 30 percent sales growth at Combat Systems and 17 percent growth at Aerospace. Operating earnings outpaced sales growth, generating earnings from continuing operations and fully diluted earnings per share growth in excess of 21 percent. Growth in the company's operating earnings resulted from significant operating leverage in three of the company's four business groups. The company's sustained focus on continuous operational improvements has generated four consecutive years of operating margin expansion and a total 260-basis-point improvement in margins during the past five years. Cash from continuing operations totaled $3 billion for the year, an increase of 37 percent over 2006. Free cash flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures, was $2.5 billion, which represents 119 percent of earnings from continuing operations. As a result of strong cash generation, the company ended the year with cash and short-term investments modestly in excess of our total debt.


broad global customer base. For the first time in the company's history, international orders were more than 50 percent of total orders. Despite a 22 percent increase in aircraft deliveries in 2007, backlog grew to an historic high of $12.3 billion. This sizeable backlog now extends the entry-intoservice date of our larger aircraft to 2011-2012. Based on the strength of this backlog and the group's proven ability to increase production efficiently, deliveries will again increase in 2008. We remain committed to investing in product development at Gulfstream. As part of this commitment, the company is building additional facilities to enable Gulfstream to efficiently design, build and service our next-generation aircraft. Last year we broke ground on a new manufacturing facility that is now complete. We also opened the first half of a new service facility, doubling the Georgia-based capacity of Gulfstream's aircraft service business. Earlier this month, we announced Gulfstream's next-generation ultra-large-cabin, ultra-long-range aircraft, the G650, which will enter service in 2012. Gulfstream aircraft will continue to set the standard for innovative business aircraft with the announcement of yet another product offering later this year.


Combat Systems

Aerospace

Combat Systems experienced powerful growth in sales and operating earnings in 2007. Revenues increased 30 percent to $4.8 billion, while operating earnings grew 35 percent to $916 million. Sales growth was driven largely by demand for the group's combat vehicles, particularly M1 Abrams tanks, Stryker wheeled combat vehicles, Light Armored Vehicles (LAVs) and Mine-Resistant, Ambush-Protected (MRAP) vehicles. Our European business also enjoyed a successful year. Military vehicle sales in Europe were up over 40 percent, with notable volume increases on the Pandur and Piranha wheeled-vehicle contracts for several European governments. Additionally, management continued to make great strides in the integration of

Gulfstream enjoyed a blockbuster year in 2007. Revenues grew by $712 million to $4.8 billion. Operating earnings reached $810 million with 16.8 percent margins. Pricing improvements and manufacturing efficiencies combined to generate 120 basis points of margin improvement. Robust demand for Gulfstream aircraft continued in 2007. Gulfstream booked orders for 257 aircraft, a 62 percent increase over 2006. Order growth of more than 30 percent year-over-year in North America was outpaced by powerful demand across an increasingly

our Spanish, Swiss, German and Austrian-based businesses, significantly improving operating efficiency. The Combat Systems backlog grew almost 8 percent in 2007, totaling $12.9 billion at year end. This backlog contains many of our core programs including $2.8 billion for the M1 Abrams main battle tank, $1 billion for Stryker, $2.3 billion for weapons systems, munitions and detection systems and $1.2 billion for Leopard tanks and Pizarro infantry fighting vehicles for the Spanish government. Looking forward, there are broad-based growth opportunities in the group's core markets, including U.S. military reset, replenishment and modernization and sales to allied nations.


destroyer, the 10th Virginia-class submarine and the 10th T-AKE ship. Notably, the Congress also added money to accelerate two-per-year submarine production and to fund advanced procurement for an additional three T-AKE ships. Given the group's order intake during 2008, both already received and anticipated, I believe that Marine Systems has the potential to lead the company in sales growth over the next four years.


Information Systems and Technology

Marine Systems

General Dynamics' shipyards had a very productive 2007. The group generated better-than-expected earnings growth of 12 percent, reaching $421 million on revenue of nearly $5 billion. Operating margins grew 80 basis points to 8.4 percent, driven by improved performance on several of the group's key programs, including the Virginia-class submarine, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and the T-AKE combat-logistics ship. Marine Systems passed several milestones this year critical to achieving strong future growth. Working closely with our Navy customer, we settled the company's request for equitable adjustment (REA) on the T-AKE contract, solidifying our continued work on the program and enabling our NASSCO shipyard to begin recognizing profit on T-AKE. NASSCO also began construction on a $1 billion, nine-ship commercial product-carrier contract. This new work broadens our customer base and provides additional opportunities in the U.S.-based commercial shipbuilding market. The Navy and the Congress remain committed to shipbuilding as evidenced by the $13.6 billion appropriated for the Navy's ship programs in Fiscal Year 2008. This funding includes the first DDG-1000

Information Systems and Technology revenues this year totaled $9.6 billion, a 6.6 percent increase over 2006. Operating earnings grew 5.2 percent and surpassed $1 billion for the first time. Performance initiatives throughout the group enabled Information Systems and Technology to achieve margins of 10.7 percent, only a 10 basis-point decline from 2006, despite my early concerns that margin compression would be more significant as a result of the increasing service profile of the group's portfolio. The group's 2007 performance was marked by abovemarket growth in our core markets, including 13 percent growth in our North American tactical communications business and 10 percent growth in our defense information technology services business. The group's performance is particularly notable in light of several distinct headwinds for the year, including an expected decline in the United Kingdom BOWMAN tactical communications program, a sluggish commercial wireless infrastructure business and a prolonged procurement pause in our classified intelligence market. The group received a record-breaking $9.5 billion in orders this year, illustrative of the continued market demand for the group's products and services. At year end, the group's backlog totaled $9.6 billion, down slightly from year-end 2006. This backlog includes $900 million for Warfighter Information Network-Tactical (WIN-T), $430 million for the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Project and $300 million for the Intelligence Information, Command-and-Control, Equipment and

I believe that continued customer demand for our core market programs and the group's ability to identify and win new opportunities position us well for future growth.


excess of one, I believe our Aerospace business remains well positioned to enjoy continued growth and profitability over the next several years notwithstanding the apparent slowdown of the American economy.


Capital Deployment

The Future

We anticipate another year of solid growth in 2008, supported by a Fiscal Year 2008 defense budget of $480 billion. This budget includes $176 billion in investment spending for procurement and research and development programs, a 10 percent increase over 2007 funding. The President's proposed 2009 budget request totals $515 billion, including $184 billion in investment spending, an increase of 5 percent from the 2008 level. These funding accounts provide the majority of the company's revenues. The President has also requested $189 billion in Fiscal Year 2008 supplemental funding. This funding is incremental to the base budget and supports the government's efforts in the Global War on Terror. The Congress has already approved $87 billion in 2008 supplemental spending and is likely to consider the remaining request sometime this year. The Defense Department has also indicated the need for additional supplemental funding in Fiscal Year 2009. We continue to believe that defense spending is driven by customer requirements and perceived threat. When our country feels threatened, the government spends on defense programs. In the years ahead, we expect the continued uncertainty in our global security environment to sustain support for the needs of our military services. Beyond the defense environment, we follow closely the larger macroeconomic environment. In light of the economy's recent uncertainty, we continually review order activity and backlog strength at Gulfstream. Having enjoyed seven consecutive quarters of book-to-bill in

Management remains focused on deploying cash to create value for our long-term shareholders. In 2007, we took advantage of market weakness from time to time to repurchase 6.5 million outstanding shares for a total of $505 million. Shareholders also received $445 million in dividend payments last year. Earlier this month, the Board increased the quarterly dividend for the 11th consecutive year to $0.35 per share, an increase of nearly 21 percent. We also continued to invest in our businesses in 2007, including spending $330 million on four acquisitions and $474 million on capital investments across the enterprise. At year end, our strong cash generation leaves us with the balance sheet strength and flexibility to maximize shareholder value through further prudent deployment of capital.


In Closing

2008 is shaping up to be another productive year. Management remains focused on the fundamentals that have driven our company's success over the years: earnings, free cash flow, disciplined capital deployment and return on invested capital. Our strong balance sheet, enduring backlog and seasoned management team position us well for the opportunities that lie ahead.
