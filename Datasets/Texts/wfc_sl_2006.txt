To Our Owners,
Again this year, our talented team--158,000 strong and pulling together for our customers--achieved outstanding results, among the best not just in financial services but all industries.
Among Our Achievements: · Diluted earnings per share, a record $2.49, up 11 percent. · Net income, a record $8.5 billion, up 11 percent. · Revenue, a record $35.7 billion--the most important measure of success in our industry--rose 8 percent, up 12 percent in businesses other than Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. · The quarterly cash dividend on our common stock increased almost 8 percent to 28 cents a share--the 19th consecutive year our dividend has increased and 13th-largest dividend payout of any U.S. public company. Since 1989, our dividend has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 15 percent.

· Return on equity--19.65 percent (after-tax profit for every shareholder dollar)--and return on assets of 1.75 percent (after-tax profit for every $100 of assets). · Our stock split two for one--our company's eighth stock split in 47 years. · Our stock price reached a record-high close of $36.81 on October 18, 2006. · Total return on our stock this year, including reinvested dividends, was 17 percent, exceeding the S&P 500® -- and the total market value of our company rose 14 percent to $120 billion.

· For the fourth consecutive year we're the United States' No. 1 lender to small businesses (loans less than $100,000) and No. 1 lender to small businesses in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods. Nationwide, our small business loans grew 30 percent. Products ("solutions") sold to our business banking customers in our stores were up 26 percent. Net business checking accounts rose 4.3 percent. Our average business banking customer now has 3.3 products with us (3.0 last year). · For the 14th consecutive year we were the nation's No. 1 retail mortgage originator. We're very disciplined in home mortgage lending--we don't make option adjustable-rate mortgages or negative amortizing mortgages. Our owned home mortgage servicing (administering the monthly payments of your home loan) reached $1.37 trillion, the largest in our industry--up 38 percent--and mortgage originations were up 9 percent to $398 billion. · Our National Home Equity Group portfolio rose to $79 billion, up 10 percent. · Wholesale Banking, for the eighth consecutive year, achieved record net income, $2.1 billion, up 17 percent--with strong double-digit growth in revenue and loans across its businesses. We acquired commercial real estate investment advisor Secured Capital Corp. (Los Angeles), multifamily real estate financier Reilly Mortgage (Virginia), investment banker Barrington Associates (Los Angeles), accounts receivable purchasers Commerce Funding (Virginia), Evergreen Funding (Texas), and insurance agencies in California, Indiana and West Virginia. · Wells Fargo Financial--our consumer finance business-- earned a record $865 million and grew average receivables secured by real estate, by 25 percent and auto finance receivables by 29 percent. One Team. Pulling Together. For Customers. Despite our superior financial performance and the outstanding efforts of our great team, we have a lot of work to do--especially in the quality of our customer service. We've said in previous annual reports that "Customer service...is the one area in which we continue to be only about average compared with our peers." We've made significant progress, but we still have more to do. We survey hundreds of thousands of our retail banking customers a year--served through all our channels--to find out what they think of the quality of our service. Our customer loyalty scores rose 32 percent the last two years. Customer perceptions of how long they have to wait in our teller lines and how satisfied they are with how we welcome them have improved 44 percent in that time. This year, Wells Fargo Home Mortgage was ranked among the top five in its industry for

Long-Term Results Although 2006 was another very successful year, it certainly wasn't the first. As shown in the chart above, we've been achieving annual, double-digit increases in revenue, earnings per share, and total stockholder return over the past 20, 15, 10 and five years. The past 20 years our annual compound growth rate in earnings per share was 14 percent; our annual compound rate in revenue 12 percent. Our total annual compound stockholder return of 14 percent the past five years was more than double the S&P 500 --and at 15 percent almost double for the past 10 years. We far outpaced the S&P 500 the past 15 and 20 years with total annual compound shareholder returns of 18 percent and 21 percent, respectively--periods with almost every economic cycle and economic condition a financial institution can experience. Full Horsepower This outstanding short- and long-term performance was driven by the full horsepower of our more than 80 businesses-- diversified across virtually all of financial services. Among their achievements: · Community Banking--record profit of $5.5 billion. Our retail banking team had record core product "solutions" (sales) of 18.7 million, up 17 percent. Sales in our banking stores have grown at an average compound rate of 14 percent the last five years. Our measures of how effectively we welcome our customers in our stores, how quickly our teller lines move, and how loyal our customers are to us all improved by double digits. · For the eighth consecutive year, our cross-sell reached record highs--5.2 products per retail banking household (up from 3.2 in 1998), and 6.0 per Wholesale Banking customer. One of every five of our customers buys eight or more products from Wells Fargo.

"What we want to instill is a culture of collaboration that instinctively and naturally puts what is best for the customer first--and then deliver it."
customer satisfaction with the way we originate and service their mortgages. In Wholesale Banking, our customer satisfaction scores were among the highest in our industry and have risen the last four years--with more than eight of 10 customers rating their total experience with us "above average" to "excellent." Our own team members--whose attitudes are the leading indicator of customer attitudes--tell us they're satisfied and happy in their work by a ratio of seven to one, in the top quartile, about four times the national average for all workers. So, what keeps us from being known as absolutely off-thecharts great in providing a superior customer experience each time, every time? The fault lies not with our team members. They try to give their all for our customers every minute of every day. They try to do what's right for our customers so we can satisfy all their financial needs. The Cost of Complexity We've concluded that the problem lies not just with the growing demands of customers for more simplicity in their lives, but in the complexity of our organization. A lack of consistency across our business lines in some processes and systems prevents us from always asking, "How will this look to the customer?" Simple or complex? Easy or time-consuming? Friendly or formal? Intuitive or confusing? As a diversified financial services company, more than just a bank, we have more than 80 businesses. That's a great advantage. We can offer customers more value and convenience --and give them a better deal for bringing us more and preferably all of their business. We can build relationships that last a lifetime. We can drive more revenue through our large, fixed-cost distribution network. We can diversify our risk and revenue sources and thus achieve consistent double-digit earnings growth. We can offer our team members lots of career opportunities within a large, growing, dynamic company. Being so large and diverse, however, also can be a disadvantage. Complexity can have a hidden cost. Presenting ourselves to our customers as 80+ different Wells Fargos can sometimes make it difficult for our customers to do business with us. So, in many ways, our most formidable competitor is...ourselves. As Pogo in the comics used to say, "We have met the enemy, and they is us." Customers aren't waiting for companies such as ours to raise the bar on service quality. They're raising it themselves. We're No. 1 in our industry in the average number of products per customer, but with that leadership comes a responsibility. The more business our customers give us, the more they expect from us. "One Wells Fargo" To make it easier for our customers to do business with us, we're changing the way we think and act--as one company, not 80+ separate businesses. Among ourselves, we call this way of thinking and acting "one Wells Fargo." We're asking ourselves, "What are the most significant ways we can present ourselves to our customers as one company?" We want our customers to see us as one organization not separately as a bank, a mortgage company, a consumer finance company, a commercial/corporate bank, a wealth management company or an insurance company. Likewise, we must see each customer not just as a bank customer, a mortgage customer, a consumer finance customer, a commercial customer, an investment customer or an insurance customer, but as a Wells Fargo customer. It's not enough to make sure we incent all our businesses financially to work well together or partner effectively. The selfinterest of our separate businesses is not enough, because from the start it leaves the most important person out of the equation: the customer! What we want to instill is a culture of collaboration that instinctively and naturally puts what is best for the customer first--and then deliver it. Examining Our Processes To think and act instinctively as "one Wells Fargo," we're systematically examining the major processes inside our company that are most important to make it easier for our customers to do business with us.

Diversified. Nationwide. Banking, insurance, investments, mortgage and consumer finance--we span North America with one of the most extensive networks of stores in all of financial services.
We're asking questions such as: · We have hundreds of different products--picture a crowded menu board at a fast food restaurant. Can we reduce and simplify the menu, and thereby reduce customer confusion, our own costs and processing errors? For example, we're thoroughly analyzing how our customers use our checking products so we can make them easier to understand and use. · When a customer comes to us with a problem--especially through our Wells Fargo Phone Bank centers--how can we increase the likelihood that we can fix the customer's problem the first time? (Our batting average now is only about .333-- great for baseball, not good enough for our customers.) If we can't fix it right away, how can we ensure that we give the customer periodic updates on the status of our investigation and specify the date we'll solve it? · How can we speak more conversationally in letters to our customers so they don't have to scratch their heads and say, "What are they talking about?" We've all had this experience as customers. In a disclosure statement, for example, why use banking terms such as "debits" and "credits"? Why say "rolling consecutive twelve month billing cycle period," as one company recently did, when it meant "the next 12 months"? · How can we make it easier for our customers to access information about their accounts, safely and securely, and with less paper? A text-messaging society that gets information at search engine speed doesn't understand overnight "batch processing" of paper checks. · Are there fees we should eliminate because customers do not perceive a fair value for them? · Can we reduce the number of "800" numbers we offer to customers from our different business lines? When a customer calls one of them, can we automatically route them to the right "800" number so we can satisfy their need or solve their problem faster? The answer is "yes."We've installed technology the last three years to do just that. · How can we make sure we don't ask our customers time and again for information about them we already have? For example, when customers use one of our 6,700+ ATMs and they always select English or Spanish or Chinese as their preferred language, we shouldn't ask them every time which language they prefer. We already know! The old saying is still true--"I wish I knew what I already know." All our ATMs remember customers' preferred withdrawal amount. We're testing technology to remember customers' preferred ATM language. Our "One Wells Fargo" Goal is Simple We must help our team members serve our customers faster and more easily so that every interaction we have with our customers --about 5,000 every minute of every day--appears to the customer to be simple, obvious, intuitive, usable, practical and, where possible, tailored to their special need of the moment. If we do that, our customers--who want us to know them, understand them, acknowledge them and reward them--will reward us with even more of their business, which will generate double-digit growth in revenue, earnings per share and stock price.

We must help our team members serve our customers faster and more easily so that every customer interaction is simple, obvious and intuitive.
Beginning on page 10 of this report, we tell the stories of 11 of our customers. Each came to us with an everyday financial problem or need all of us are familiar with--how to qualify for a home equity loan, what to do when your checking account is overdrawn through no fault of your own, or how to manage personal finances after the death of a spouse. They did not see themselves as coming to our bank, our mortgage company, our website, our investment businesses, our consumer finance company or our insurance business. They came to Wells Fargo, period, because that's the way they see us. In many of these situations a Wells Fargo team member took personal responsibility to make sure that our businesses--collaborating together (sometimes dozens or hundreds of our team members behind the curtain)--satisfied the customer's financial need smoothly and simply. In most of these situations, we not only satisfied that need but earned even more of that customer's business. Diversified. Nationwide. And Growing! Despite the challenges and uncertainty ahead for our economy and our industry in 2007, we're as optimistic, as ever, about our ability to satisfy all our customers' financial needs and help them succeed financially. We have one vision. We've made steady, measurable progress toward it for more than 20 years. We have an effective, time-tested business model. We have great people. We have a very strong, well-understood culture. We have one of the broadest, most extensive product lines in our industry. We're also in the fastest-growing markets in the United States, the world's most dynamic, prosperous national economy. One of our best-kept secrets is our recent growth in the eastern United States. Almost half our Wells Fargo Home Mortgage and Wells Fargo Financial stores in the United States are in states outside our Community Banking states, and almost one of every five of our Wholesale Banking offices is east of the Mississippi. In Florida, for example, we have 133 stores (mortgage, consumer finance and commercial banking), and we're one of its 40 largest private employers. We have 51 stores in Maryland, headquarters for our national Corporate Trust business, and we're one of that state's 50 largest private employers. In Pennsylvania, we employ almost 2,000 team members, have 55 stores, and it's national headquarters for our Auto Finance business. We have no compelling need for a retail banking presence in the eastern United States. That's because we have such tremendous untapped opportunity for more market share growth in our community banking states in the Midwest, the Southwest, the Rockies, the West and the Pacific Northwest. We estimate we have only about 3 percent market share of total household financial assets in those states. Consider the approximate population growth rates of just nine of our fastest-growing Community Banking states:

The last five years, for example, both California and Texas each added the equivalent of a city about the size of Houston. Nevada added the equivalent of a St. Louis. Arizona, almost the equivalent of an Indianapolis. Colorado, more than a Toledo. Projected 20year growth rates are even more dramatic. California and Texas each could add another eight million people. Nation of Immigrants Much of this growth in our Community Banking states comes from new immigrants who have been the lifeblood of our country's dynamic, entrepreneurial economy and work ethic since our nation's first days. Immigration is now at a 70-year high in the United States. At least one of nine American residents is foreign-born. They've accounted for half the growth of the United States labor force since 1995. They're now 15 percent of the work force. California has become the nation's first white minority state--home to one of every three Hispanics in the United States. There are surprises everywhere you look. The New York Times found that in one town in central Iowa, Denison, half the children in kindergarten are ethnically diverse. In Clark County, Idaho, almost a fifth of the population is foreign-born. Fifteen years ago, the U.S. census counted about 3,500 residents of Mexican birth in Minnesota; today, it's about 200,000. More and more Americans identify with more than one culture. Seven million registered for the census as a combination of races. One of every four residents in suburban America is ethnically diverse. U.S. Latinos have estimated buying power of $736 billion, African-Americans $723 billion, Asian-Americans $400 billion. Immigrants and ethnic minorities are the fastestgrowing segment of first-time U.S. home buyers. Key to U.S. Prosperity: Access to Financial Services for All A recent report said it well: Our nation's economic prosperity now depends to a great extent on whether the economic progress of immigrants can keep pace with their growth in numbers.* They cannot achieve prosperity without access to financial services. That's how they can achieve the American dream--become entrepreneurs and start businesses, own homes, build credit histories and save for retirement. The immigrants' main point of entry into the U.S. banking system is the checking account. That's why all of us at Wells Fargo welcome these potential customers with open arms to help them succeed financially. Five years ago Wells Fargo was the first bank in the United States to promote the use of the Matricula Consular as a form of identification to help Mexican Nationals move from the risky cash economy to secure, reliable financial services. Since then--with the active support of the U.S. Treasury Department and hundreds of local police departments and municipalities--
* "Financial Access for Immigrants: Lessons from Diverse Perspectives," Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, The Brookings Institution, May 2006.

we've welcomed one million of these account holders as Wells Fargo banking customers. We've expanded this Consular program to include immigrants from Guatemala, Argentina and Colombia. We also partner with U.S. consulates and embassies in Asia to offer banking information to Asians preparing to come to the United States. We've publicly committed to spend at least $1 billion with diverse suppliers in five years, and we're half way there. Our spending with diverse suppliers has risen 25 percent the past three years. We were the first major U.S. bank to enable consumers to remit money to China and Vietnam, expanding this service beyond the Philippines, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and India. The past 12 years, we've loaned $33 billion to businesses owned by Latinos, African-Americans, Asian-Americans and women. More and more of our banking stores in diverse neighborhoods reflect the culture of their communities--in ethnic backgrounds and language skills of our team members, in the art and design of those stores, in the diverse vendors we hire to build and remodel them. It's no wonder we're optimistic about the future of our company and our country! The "Next Stage" We thank our 158,000 talented team members for their outstanding accomplishments and record results. We thank our customers for entrusting us with more of their business and for returning to us for their next financial services product. We thank our communities--thousands of them across North America-- that we partner with to make them better places to live and work. And we thank you, our owners, for your confidence in Wells Fargo as we begin our 156th year. The "Next Stage" of success is just down the road as we become "one Wells Fargo"-- for our team members, our customers, our communities and our stockholders. It's going to be a great ride!
