President and Chief Executive Officer Alan Armstrong

Dear fellow stockholders,
Williams in 2013 strengthened the fundamentals of our business in the face of challenges presented by the continued decline in natural gas liquids margins and the significant and tragic incident at our Geismar plant. Our fee-based revenue growth has now eclipsed the decline in NGL margins and we're on the verge of bringing into service a series of large-scale, fee-based projects that are expected to drive a significant increase in Williams' cash flows from operations through 2015. This past year was action-packed. We added muscle to our natural gas network and expressed our innovation with breakthrough projects from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. We achieved double-digit dividend growth for our shareholders, while reliably serving customers across North America. We set delivery records, won additional business, aggressively managed costs and committed to new opportunities -- all moving us closer to our goal of becoming the leading energy infrastructure provider in North America. As intended, the One Williams organizational structure we put into place
 2013 Annual Report 

at the beginning of last year is helping improve the company's project execution and operational excellence -- capabilities that are core to our strategy of developing and operating reliable large-scale energy infrastructure. Our overall level of capital investment in our business topped $4 billion in 2013 as we placed into service a number of important projects and completed strategic expansions. We increased by 20 percent our full-year dividend to shareholders and reaffirmed our expectation that cash flow growth from Williams Partners and Access Midstream Partners will drive this level of annual dividend growth through the 2014 to 2015 guidance period. The company's strong performance was driven primarily by Williams Partners' feebased cash flow from its gathering and processing assets as well as its interstate natural gas pipelines. Timely expansions to our Transco pipeline, the largestvolume natural gas transmission system in the nation, drove record-breaking volume deliveries in areas stretching from Mississippi to New York City.

"Demand from a range of industry participants -- particularly power generators, manufacturers and petrochemical producers -- is providing an extraordinary level of growth opportunities at Williams."

We continued to expand our presence in the Marcellus producing area in the Northeast. We now have 5 million acres in this area dedicated to our various assets and investments in gathering and processing. We gathered 63 percent more natural gas than a year earlier in the Marcellus, outpacing the overall rate of growth by the industry by nearly 50 percent for the year. Our tradition of innovation also showed in 2013. In Canada, we began extracting a mixture of ethane and ethylene from oil sands production, marking a first in Alberta's history. Historically, the value potential of these hydrocarbons was unrealized as they were burned with the offgas as fuel. Our project is now delivering up to 17,000 barrels per day of ethane/ ethylene feedstock to petrochemical facilities in Alberta, and continues to significantly lower the carbon footprint of oil sands production. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, our made-inthe-U.S. floating production spar is on schedule to start serving our deepwater customers by third quarter 2014. We now are in the hook-up and commissioning stage after a record-setting offshore installation program in 4,000 feet of water. This turnkey product, which is part of Williams' deepwater field development program, combines production-handling services with export pipeline and oil and gas gathering and processing services. For all our progress, we also faced some challenges. In the Marcellus, we worked hard to overcome operational and reliability issues associated with newly acquired assets. On the engineering and construction side, cumbersome and often redundant permitting and regulatory requirements, along with land-use issues, continue to ramp up the cost and time it takes to install large-scale energy infrastructure.

Most difficult of all, we suffered a tragic incident at our Geismar, La., olefins facility that claimed the lives of two fellow employees. This was a dark day in our company's history, but the Williams community did an excellent job working in a transparent manner with regulators to determine the cause, and ensure safeguards are in place for the future. From a financial perspective, insurance policies are expected to significantly mitigate the effects of the plant downtime and personnel have been hard at work to restart the plant -- and its 45 percent expansion -- expected this June. The expanded plant, with a total ethylene production capacity of 1.95 billion pounds per year, is expected to play a vital role in reducing our exposure to weak natural gas liquid prices. Looking ahead, our company is approaching a crucial time in the development of energy infrastructure in North America. Demand from a range of industry participants -- particularly power generators, manufacturers and petrochemical producers -- is providing an extraordinary level of growth opportunities at Williams. Our focus is on building largescale, market-integrated infrastructure to meet the tremendous appetite for additional transportation capacity. Developing projects of this size is increasingly costly, complex and timeconsuming. Fortunately, for Williams, we have the advantage of scale, as well as the capabilities and experience to deliver on large projects. We'll leverage these strengths as we place into service approximately $4.5 billion in projects on the schedule for 2014 and 2015. Once operational, these vital infrastructure assets will have the distinction of reliably meeting our customers' needs and creating the durable, fee-based revenues we believe will increase shareholder value.
