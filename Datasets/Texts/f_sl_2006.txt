fter a difficult year in 2006, Ford Motor Company stands at a pivotal crossroad. In the face of fierce global competition, we are taking dramatic and sometimes painful steps to transform our business. We have improved our cost structure, raised our quality, obtained financing and refilled our product pipeline with exciting new vehicles. Alan Mulally, our new President and CEO, is an engineer who is passionate about customers and knows how to win in a global market. He is moving us quickly toward our goal of being more globally integrated and competitive. We have a lot of work to do, but we have made solid progress in a short period. We are taking actions to reduce our operating costs and realign our capacity to reflect the realities of the market. At the same time, we are speeding up and strengthening our new product development process to take full advantage of our global resources and growing world markets. Our turnaround will take time, but we are determined to make it happen. The ongoing success of Ford Motor Company is my life's work. I want us to be the company that makes a difference in people's lives ­ one that inspires its employees, delights its customers, rewards its shareholders and makes the world a better place. To do that we must deliver desirable products with a competitive cost structure and a sustainable business model. We are taking major steps to ensure that we succeed at these fundamentals, as well as our larger mission. I am confident in our team and in our plan. And I am more determined than ever to build a great Ford Motor Company for the next 100 years and beyond.
