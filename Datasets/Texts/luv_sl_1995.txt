To Our Shareholders:
In fourth quarter 1994 and first quarter 1995, our year over year earnings were down substantially as the proud and beloved People of Southwest Airlines defended themselves against simultaneous assaults from Continental Lite and the United Shuttle. Because of my supreme confidence in the dedication, martial vigor, and extreme valor of our People, I predicted in our 1994 Annual Report that Southwest’s fortunes would begin to recover in the second quarter of 1995. I also said that:
“While a number of other airlines may attempt to imitate Southwest, none of them can duplicate the spirit, unity, ‘can do’attitudes, and marvelous esprit de corps of the Southwest Employees, who continually provide superb Customer Service to each other and to the traveling public. Just as the past has belonged to Southwest because of our People’s goodwill, dedication, and energy, so shall Southwest seize the future!”
As of today, Continental Lite has ceased to exist and the United Shuttle has substantially receded from Southwest’s Oakland, California, markets. Because of our Employees’indefatigable efforts, a 72 percent year over year decline in first quarter 1995 profits has been transmogrified into a 1995 record annual profit of $182,626,000 ($1.23 per share), a two percent increase over the $179,331,000 ($1.22 per share) of 1994.
Our fourth quarter 1995 earnings of $43,359,000 ($.29 per share) made a very substantial contribution to our 1995 “turnaround,”as they exceeded 1994’s $20,343,000 ($.14 per share) by 113 percent.
Despite the adverse cost impact of the recently effective 4.3 cents per gallon federal jet fuel tax, accompanied, as well, by thus far moderate increases in jet fuel prices, from this early vantage point we presently anticipate, barring any unforeseen and deleterious external events, that our first quarter 1996 earnings will substantially exceed those of first quarter 1995.

During 1996, we anticipate adding 20 new Boeing 737-300s to our fleet and removing three older 737-200s therefrom. Our net increase in available seat mile capacity is expected to be approximately 13 percent.
As of this writing, our just inaugurated service to Tampa and Ft. Lauderdale is already producing average daily load factors in excess of our system averages, and we are, therefore, optimistic that Florida will be a successful addition to our growing route system. We will inaugurate service to Orlando in April 1996, and we currently plan to devote at least eleven of our twenty 1996 aircraft deliveries to our new Florida markets.
As American Airlines has “dehubbed”Nashville, we have been steadily adding replacement service, and Southwest is now the largest Nashville air carrier in terms of daily flight departures. In 1996, we will inaugurate nonstop service from Nashville to Tampa and Orlando and one-stop service to Ft. Lauderdale.
After beginning 1995 with a truly dismal first quarter earnings performance, I am especially pleased and extremely happy to be able to report to our Shareholders 1995 annual financial results slightly improved over those for 1994. How was this “miracle”of 1995 accomplished? It was achieved through the fighting spirit of the marvelous People of Southwest Airlines. They never give in and they never give up; that is why they are my heroines and my heroes!
Most sincerely,
Herbert D. Kelleher Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer January 27, 1996
P.S. Our People are also a heck of a lot of fun to be with!
