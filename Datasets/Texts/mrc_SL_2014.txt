Dear MRC Global Shareholders,
I am pleased to report that 2014 was a strong year for MRC Global. We achieved record revenues of $5.933 billion, $1.018 billion in gross profit, and $424 million in adjusted EBITDA. While we are pleased with these achievements, we are not surprised. Years ago we set in motion a focused set of strategic initiatives. These efforts are now bearing fruit, and we believe they have set us on a trajectory of continued growth and success.

A Growing Global Presence Perhaps the greatest theme for 2014 was international expansion. Most MRC Global customers have significant overseas spending ­ revenue that was out of our reach in the past. Our strategy has been to take our successful North American service model and strong customer relationships and extend them to other regions. Last year we worked that strategy on multiple fronts by making a number of key regional acquisitions and opening new distribution centers in Europe and the Middle East. For years our customers have trusted us with their North American business, and now we have put the pieces in place to serve their needs around the world. MRC Global emerges from 2014 with much stronger geographic diversification. Last year we achieved a record $873 million in international revenues, and these markets now comprise 15% of our business. These figures represent significant increases, and we expect they will continue to grow.

Acquiring Strength While organic growth is always a primary focus, timely execution of our international strategy called for looking outward. We found some of the best companies in our target regions and added them to the MRC Global platform. Our flagship acquisition in 2014 was Stream AS, the leading PVF distributor and provider of flow control products, solutions and services to the offshore oil and gas industry on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. Based in Stavanger, Norway, Stream serves projects in a harsh environment that calls for the highest operating standards and advanced, higher-margin PVF products. MRC Global also acquired Hypteck AS in Norway, a provider of instrumentation and process control equipment that complements Stream's offerings. Together, these acquisitions have given us strong inroads to offshore markets and immediately grew our offshore revenue from 2% to 8% of our business. Our company now has a presence in four of the top five offshore regions. We also became the leading supplier of valves and valve actuation systems in the Asia Pacific region by acquiring MSD Engineering in Singapore. Another notable acquisition was Flangefitt in the U.K., which took place in late December 2013, adding to our breadth of product offerings in stainless and higher alloy metals.

Expanded Distribution MRC Global's success has come from supporting our customers in the producing regions where they need us. Our hub-and-spoke system of Regional Distribution Centers (RDCs) is a key component of our service model, and we continued to extend its reach and efficiency in 2014. We leased a new

RDC in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which will be operational in 2015, to serve the Marcellus Shale, and doubled the size of current RDCs in Odessa, Texas, and Nisku in Canada. Hand-in-hand with MRC Global's acquisitions, our goal in distribution has been to replicate our successful, scalable North American model in major international basins. We opened a new RDC in Rotterdam, Netherlands, which allows us to serve all of Western Europe. To cover the Middle East, we opened a new RDC in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. This was a key addition that enabled our relationship with North American Western Asia Holdings (NAWAH). The NAWAH alliance gives MRC Global access to the fast-developing energy industry in Iraq, which boasts one of the world's largest crude oil reserves and is a major development target for some of our largest customers and prospects. MRC Global now operates from more than 400 locations worldwide. We have $1.2 billion in inventory sourced from over 45 countries. I'm proud to say that MRC Global now serves customers in all our targeted regions.

Looking Forward MRC Global has come a long way in executing our strategic plans. We are serving more customers in more ways in more places. We have built a strong global base. Our goal going forward is to add organic growth on top of that base, improve profitability and reduce debt. While lower oil prices will make 2015 a challenging year, MRC Global is positioned not only to weather the storm, but also to gain ground. We have seen fluctuating prices many times before, and we strive to use them as opportunities. After the last downturn, MRC Global transitioned away from commoditized products toward highermargin offerings with more stable prices, such as valves and valve automation, which today account for 32% of our

business. For today's complex projects, operators need the breadth of products, reliability and quality MRC Global can bring to the table. The company is further stabilized because we serve all markets in the production stream. Activity in the shale plays is expected to continue to drive midstream business, although perhaps at a slower pace. There is still a need for new transmission lines to more distant facilities and for continued upgrades in the gas utility space. In downstream there is potential for more than $100 billion in projects for planned expansion and new build-out of petrochemical facilities. In addition to these prospects, our expanded international presence strengthens our foundation as well. MRC Global will be there when markets recover. We have sound strategies, solid relationships, and a strong balance sheet to support our plans. We are focused on the factors that we can control ­ executing our strategy, controlling costs, and taking care of our customers. Furthermore, our business generates cash flow during downturns as inventory is drawn down and receivables are collected, and we will use that cash to reduce debt over the next year. We also have the advantage of employing the best people in the business. Revenues per employee are at record highs, which is powerful evidence that MRC Global employees are the most dedicated, most productive workforce in the industry. In closing, I would like to thank our talented employees. They are the reason our strategies are succeeding and our business is growing. Likewise, I thank our excellent suppliers for their service and our customers for their trust and loyalty. Finally, I thank you, our shareholders, for your continued investment in MRC Global. Sincerely,

Andrew R. Lane Chairman, President and CEO
