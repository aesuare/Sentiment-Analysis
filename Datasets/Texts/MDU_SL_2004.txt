                                        report to stockholders
   Two hundred years ago, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark spent the winter in what is now North Dakota – about 40 miles north of our present-day corporate office. Their journey was built on President Thomas Jefferson’s vision of coast-to-coast commerce and learning about natural resources that would fuel the country’s growth.
 Our corporation is built on our vision statement.
We have grown from a small utility with roots in the Northern Great Plains to an international enterprise. Our mission is to provide value-added natural resource products and services that exceed customer expectations.
Lewis and Clark certainly exceeded Jefferson’s expectations. Throughout this report, you will see excerpts from their fascinating journals. My letter is like their journals – a story documenting a successful mission to help build a strong America, made possible by people with determination and a vision.
Record results benefit shareholders
MDU Resources had another exceptional year. In 2004, we had record earnings of $206.4 million, compared to $174.6 million for 2003. Earnings per common share, diluted, totaled $1.76, compared to $1.55 for 2003.
To our shareholders that means an outstanding one-year total shareholder return of 15 percent. Over the past
five years, our total annual return was 19 percent, while our peer group average return was 16 percent and the S&P 500 average return was -2 percent.
Our dividend is an important aspect of shareholder returns. MDU Resources has an unbroken record of quarterly dividend payments since 1937. We increased our quarterly dividend 5.9 percent in August 2004. This increased our annualized dividend to 72 cents per share. Our dividend has gone up every year since 1990. In addition, the compound annual growth rate for our annual dividends has exceeded 5 percent over the past five years.
Company recognized for performance
We were named a Mergent Dividend Achiever in 2004 for our outstanding record of 10 or more years of consecutive dividend increases. We’re proud of this honor, especially because only 3 percent of dividend- paying companies in the United States have achieved it.
The April 5, 2004, issue of Fortune Magazine ranked MDU Resources No. 629 in its Fortune 1,000 list, based on total revenues. Out of 18 companies listed in the energy industry, MDU Resources was ranked No. 2 both for total return to investors and for earnings per share annual growth from 1993 to 2003. Total return during that period was 14 percent and earnings per share annual growth was 9 percent.

For the fifth consecutive year, Forbes magazine named MDU Resources to its Platinum 400 list of the best big companies in America, based on criteria such as corporate governance and accounting practices as well as financial performance. The list appeared in the January 10, 2005, issue.
With integrity
The first two words of our vision statement are
“with integrity.” You will read more about this in the corporate governance section. Operating with integrity is core to our culture at MDU Resources. It guides every decision we make.
Related to that is our commitment to respect the environment and to support the communities we serve. Our natural gas and oil segment was recognized with a major environmental stewardship award in 2004, as well as a public outreach and education award for its work
with landowners. The MDU Resources Foundation, the philanthropic organization within the corporation and its affiliated companies, has contributed more than $8 million to qualified charities and organizations throughout the United States since its incorporation in 1983.
Creating superior shareholder value
Nothing demonstrates the next part of our vision statement, “creating superior shareholder value,” like
the performance of our natural gas and oil business
in 2004. Natural gas prices were 20 percent higher and oil prices were 25 percent higher. While prices certainly contributed to the $110.8 million in earnings from that segment in 2004, the strategies behind those earnings allowed us to fully seize the advantages of a strong market.
We are focused on building long-term value by increasing the natural gas and oil reserves that we own and the production that we operate. Our nonoperated investments diversify our reserve portfolio and our cash flow. We have doubled our production levels from 35 billion cubic
feet equivalent in 1999 to 70 Bcfe in 2004. During that same time period, reserves also grew by 9 percent on a compound annual growth basis. We had positive results for 91 percent of the wells we drilled last year and increased total production by 7 percent from 2003 levels. Success such as this points to the expertise of our employees. If you put that all together – a vertically integrated company with a diverse asset base, growth in production as well
as reserves and a team of talented employees – our shareholders are getting good value for their investments.
Expanding upon our expertise
The next part of our vision statement, “expanding upon our expertise,” is best demonstrated by our construction materials and mining segment. We applied our coal mining expertise to the aggregate industry to start this business in 1992. It has achieved phenomenal growth since that time, now representing 25 percent of the corporation’s earnings. We’ve acquired more than 50 companies in medium-size markets near metropolitan growth areas. This strategy has proved successful in obtaining market share and in integrating these companies into our culture. We have 1.3 billion tons of aggregate reserves, a valuable asset in a country that consumes more than 10 tons of aggregate reserves per capita on an annual basis.
Another example of expanding on our expertise is
our domestic and international independent power production segment. We’ve been operating power plants since the company began more than 80 years ago. We took that expertise and moved into the independent
   our Vision
With integrity, create superior shareholder value by expanding upon our expertise to be the supplier of choice in all of our markets while being a safe and great place to work.

                                        power business in 2001, when we built an electric generating facility in Brazil. In three short years, that segment has grown to be our third-largest earnings generator, producing earnings of $26.3 million in 2004. This segment is now responsible for 1,165 megawatts
of owned and operated electric generation, including domestic power production facilities fueled by wind or natural gas. In 2005, we will seek projects with mid- to long-term contracts with quality customers while bringing a new 116-MW coal-fired facility on line in Montana.
The supplier of choice
The next phrase in our vision statement discusses being the supplier of choice in all of our markets. Many of
our shareholders chose our stock because of its relative stability. Part of that stability comes from our regulated assets, which can be counted on for a steady return. Customers consistently rate our service high, while our electric generating facilities are among the most reliable in the country. We’re studying the feasibility of constructing a 175-megawatt coal-fired unit that could go on line in 2010. This new generation would replace the power that we purchase from external suppliers and would support modest customer growth.
The first full year of operation for the Grasslands Pipeline contributed to record gathering and transportation volumes for our pipeline and energy services business. It enables us to access broader markets with the natural gas that we produce from our exploration and production activities. We also expanded our gathering facilities with the goal of becoming the service provider of choice in areas where production is steadily increasing.
Our utility services business is in a rebuilding phase, bringing in new leadership and adjusting its course. We expect to see significant improvement in 2005. Our restructured team will focus on being the supplier of choice while keeping a watchful eye on margins.
A safe and great place to work
That last phrase in our vision statement,“while being
a safe and great place to work,” is one of the most important. Safety is a priority at MDU Resources. Our businesses are committed to doing everything possible to send every employee home safely each night. We continue our efforts to become a greater place to work. This year we surveyed employees and were pleased to learn that they continue to be proud to work here. In fact, even though the number of employees responding to the survey has grown 48 percent since 1998, our scores have remained solid. We continue to focus on a quality work environment for all of our employees.
Employees make our success possible. They drive the trucks, energize the lines and produce the fuel. They provide the products and services that help make America strong. And they do it with the best interest of our shareholders in mind. As I said earlier, it’s our culture
at MDU Resources, and I thank our employees for their dedication. We’ve had another great year. Our journey in building a legendary company continues.
