expense of $0.6 million, or $0.06 per share. Excluding these unusual items, net income and basic net income per share for 2012 were $29.6 million and $3.21, compared to $33.3 million and $3.62 for 2011. We were pleased with our top-line growth in 2012, with total revenues increasing by $53.2 million or 3.4 percent. The strong revenue growth was driven in part by gains in market share in our Sparkling portfolio

Our operating results for 2012 reflect another solid year with growth in revenue and market share. These results also reflect an increase in operating costs due to investments we made in people and marketing, as well as the development of our long-term growth strategy. The Company reported net income of $27.2 million, or basic net income

per share of $2.95, compared to net income of $28.6 million, or basic net income per share of $3.11 in 2011. The comparability of earnings between 2012 and 2011 was impacted by several unusual items. Our 2012 results included non-cash gains on our hedging programs of $0.3 million net of tax, or $0.03 per share. The results also include unfavorable adjust ments to income tax expense of $2.7 million, or $0.29 per share. Our 2011 results include non-cash losses on our hedging programs of $4.1 million net of tax, or $0.45 per share, and net unfavorable adjustments to income tax

as a result of new products, new packaging and marketing innovation. We experienced market share growth in key channels including grocery, mass merchandisers and drugstores. Our gross margin for the year increased by $25.1 million, or 4.0 percent, due to strong revenue growth and lowerthan-expected increases in our cost of sales. Our selling, delivery and administrative costs for the year were up by 4.4 percent. Consistent with our Purpose, we are relentlessly focused on growing our business profitably. Profitable growth

means growing revenue, operating more efficiently and continuing to strengthen our financial position. Growing Revenue We operate in highly competitive and developed markets. To continue growing, we utilize a focused strategy to increase market share and innovate in ways that drive consumer demand and customer value. Our volume growth for 2012 was approximately 1 percent, comprised of a decrease of less than 1 percent in our Sparkling beverages and an increase of more than 9 percent in our Still beverage portfolio, with Powerade, smartwater and vitaminwater leading that growth. To spur growth in our Sparkling beverage portfolio, we introduced the 1.25liter package in 2011, primarily as a take-home package for our large retailers. This package is generally priced at $0.99, which value-oriented consumers find attractive. In 2012, we expanded the distribution of the 1.25liter package into the convenience channel, where it has become a highly competitive offering, helping us grow revenue and market share. The convenience channel is our second-largest channel and very important to our goal of long-term profitable growth ­ driving profit for today, while creating the consumers of tomorrow. During the past several years, we have introduced new bottle sizes and price points for immediate consumption in this key channel with resulting market share gains in many of our territories. As

competitive dynamics change, our immediate consumption strategy will continue to evolve. In late 2012, we introduced a new three-bottle strategy designed for the differing needs of convenience shoppers: a 16ounce offering in limited brands, generally value-priced at $0.99; a 20ounce bottle competitively priced for frequent buyers; and a value-added 24ounce package. In recent years, we have seen our strongest growth in the value and drugstore channels, as consumers have migrated toward these channels. We created specific packaging for the value channel, since it has grown significantly with the economic challenges of the past few years. Our 2012 performance in both these channels outpaced our overall performance. We focus our marketing and promotional efforts in areas where we believe we can generate above average return on investment. In the past two years, we extended or entered into long-term commitments with many major colleges in our franchise territory. Our relationships with these colleges not only help us build brand awareness and loyalty among a key target group of consumers, but also provide us with valuable insight on our brands and consumer tastes. Improving Efficiency and Productivity

Along with growing our revenue, it is imperative that we continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our business. During

the past several years, we have experienced significant increases in raw materials, packaging, fuel and other input costs. In the competitive market in which we operate, we cannot always pass additional costs to the customer. To offset higher costs, we continue to identify ways to leverage technology, develop new tools and enhance or change existing processes. Our focus on continuous improvement and productivity is company-wide, from sourcing and ordering raw materials to processing customer payments.

while reducing miles driven and the number of delivery stops. CooLift also prompted changes in our warehouses and how we build loads for distribution. In our largest distribution center in Charlotte, we installed an automated order-building system that has dramatically increased the number of cases the warehouse can handle. The increased capacity has allowed us to consolidate some smaller warehouses and serve additional territories directly from Charlotte. We are in the process of installing a second automated orderbuilding system in Nashville, Tenn.,

Delivery expenses are one of the largest items in our selling, delivery and administrative costs, and we have made significant progress in reducing or slowing the growth rate of these costs. Several years ago, we developed the proprietary delivery tool CooLift. This tool transformed the way we deliver product, moving away from traditional side-bay beverage trucks with drivers building loads at the customer site. We now primarily use a rear-loaded vehicle, from which our drivers can simply wheel a pre-built pallet into the customer's store. CooLift has increased the number of cases delivered per stop,

and evaluating the economic benefits of installing systems in other areas in the future. Our improved delivery and warehouse operations have provided other benefits including better inventory control, decreased shrinkage costs and a reduction in losses due to accidents. During the past five years, the number of workers' compensation claims and vehicle accidents declined by more than 50 percent. Serving our employees begins with providing them a safe place to work. These are just a few examples of the ancillary benefits provided by

our ongoing efforts to improve productivity and efficiency throughout our operations. Strengthening Our Financial Position In order to effectively operate our business, we must continue to make significant capital investments in facilities, transportation, and equipment and technology. During the past decade, we have focused on reducing our leverage and achieving a stronger financial position. We have reduced the Company's long-term debt by more than 50 percent. This debt reduction and related lower interest payments free up capital that we can invest in our operations to drive revenue growth. The considerable improvement in our financial position also allows us to take advantage of strategic growth opportunities as they arise. CocaCola Consolidated employees are very passionate and determined about growing our revenue, achieving greater efficiency and productivity, and strengthening our financial position. This talented team loves the brands we sell and the business we are in and meets the challenges of our business with energy and creativity every single day. They drive our Purpose, and we are honored to serve them. We are pleased with the Company's progress in 2012. We are grateful for your continued support and very optimistic about the Company's future.
