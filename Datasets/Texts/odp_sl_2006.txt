AS WE MARKED OUR 20TH ANNIVERSARY IN 2006, WE PAUSED TO REFLECT ON HOW FAR WE HAVE COME SINCE OUR FOUNDERS STARTED BUSINESS WITH ONE STORE, A HANDFUL OF EMPLOYEES AND DREAMS OF POSSIBILITY. 4O SAY THAT WE HAVE REALIZED THAT VISION IS A VAST UNDERSTATEMENT. TODAY, OFFICE DEPOT IS A gLOBAL
500 COMPANY WITH ANNUAL SALES THAT EXCEED D15 BILLION AND MORE THAN 52,000 EMPLOYEES. WE SERVE THE NEEDS OF A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMERS THOUGH THREE DIVISIONS, AND WE ARE A LEADER IN EVERY DISTRIBUTION CHANNELFROM RETAIL STORES AND CONTRACT DELIVERY TO CATALOGS AND E-COMMERCE. MOREOVER, WE ARE THE ONLY TRUE GLOBAL PLAYER IN OUR INDUSTRY, SERVING CUSTOMERS IN 42 COUNTRIES.
WHILE OUR #OMPANY HAS EVOLVED DRAMATICALLY AND ACHIEVED POSSIBILITIES ONLY DREAMED OF OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES, OUR COMMITMENT TO GROWTH REMAINS AS STRONG AS THE DAY WE WERE FOUNDED. WE ARE FULFILLING THIS COMMITMENT BY FOCUSING ON WELL-DEFINED STRATEGIC PRIORITIES IN EACH OF OUR THREE BUSINESSES:
