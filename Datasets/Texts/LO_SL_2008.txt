Dear Fellow Shareholders,
This past year was one of the most exciting and eventful in Lorillard’s 250 year history. After a 39 year period
as a subsidiary of Loews Corporation, we successfully completed the separation from Loews on June 10, 2008 and began trading as an independent company on the New York Stock Exchange. This marked the beginning of a new chapter in our history, one in which we look forward to generating value for our public shareholders.
Our core strategy remains to leverage the value of our flagship brand, Newport®, which is the top selling product in the menthol category and second largest selling cigarette brand overall in the United States. In addition, we continue to focus on operational excellence and marketing efficiency, which has positioned us as the industry leader in relative profitability. By executing our strategy and pursuing
the right opportunities, we believe that we can generate outstanding long-term shareholder value.
I am pleased to report that we achieved our goals during 2008 and delivered a strong operating performance
in line with our expectations. For the year, our sales increased by 5.9% to $4.2 billion, our operating income increased by 11.1% to $1.4 billion, and we recorded net income of $887 million, or $5.15 per share. These full year results are even more impressive considering the challenges faced in the broader economy.
Our key focus is the menthol market and our flagship brand, Newport®, continues to grow and gain market share. During 2008 we continued to lead the menthol category of the industry, and gained share not only of the menthol category, but of the overall tobacco market as well, continuing the trend we have seen during the past five years. Between 2002 and 2008 Newport’s®
share of the menthol category increased from 28.6% to 33.7%. Likewise, menthol’s share of the cigarette market continued to grow, from 26.0% to 28.6% during this period. During 2008 Newport’s® domestic U.S. wholesale shipments increased by 1.5% and Newport’s® share of the menthol category increased by 8/10 of a point to 33.7%.
Lorillard will continue to focus its promotional activities on markets where menthol has a significant market presence and where we will achieve the highest return on investment. These include the major metropolitan areas in the eastern U.S., along with other regions in the eastern U.S. and selected markets west of the Mississippi, within markets with the highest penetration of menthol sales.
After completing the separation in June, Lorillard began executing its stated plan to return value to shareholders. We declared and paid dividends of $1.84 for the second half of the year, consistent with the aim of paying out 70-75% of earnings. The Company currently expects

to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends to its stockholders of 70-75% of net income. We also authorized a $400 million share repurchase program, which we completed in October, having repurchased, in the aggregate, approximately 5.9 million shares at an average purchase price of $68.22 per share.
The Company established its Board of Directors with myself and our CFO David Taylor joining independent directors Robert Almon, Virgis Colbert, David Dangoor, Kit Dietz, Richard Roedel and Nigel Travis. The members of our Board have excellent track records of success and
a diverse set of strengths and skills which have proven, and will continue to prove, invaluable to Lorillard as we pursue our strategic objectives.
We operate in a highly competitive market. Furthermore, there have been, and will continue to be, increases in state and federal excise taxes and we expect consideration of increased regulation of the tobacco industry in the new Congress. Litigation against the industry will
also continue. The Company will continue to defend itself against litigation, promote the issue of choice for consumers, and will manage the business to promote continued success.
As we look to the future, despite the challenges we face, we believe we are well positioned to continue our strong performance. Newport® has very strong brand loyalty and we expect it to continue to increase its share of the attractive menthol category. As the third largest cigarette company in the United States we have an excellent management team that has a strong track record, and
is committed to continuing our long tradition of success and excellence.
In summary, 2008 was an excellent year for our company. We have made significant progress in the short time
that we have been an independent company and we look forward to continuing to execute our core strategy while ultimately enhancing shareholder value.
In closing, we would like to thank all of our employees for their dedication and hard work and our shareholders for their trust and continued support of our company.
