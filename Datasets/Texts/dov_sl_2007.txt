Dear Shareholders,
In 2007, Dover Corporation continued to build on its positive track record of
generating global growth, while improving its operating performance through its focus on “PERFORMANCECOUNTS” and the five Dover metrics. Dover set new records with revenue of $7.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year, and earnings from continuing operations were $3.22 per share, up 12% over 2006. Taking a longer view, Dover’s improved performance and strategic initiatives over the past five years have resulted in revenues growing at a compound annual rate of nearly 18%, while earnings per share has increased at a compound growth rate of 25%. After two very strong years of double digit organic growth, Dover reported 2.3% organic growth in 2007. This reflected solid 5.2% organic growth in the industrial busi- nesses offset by headwinds in Electronic Technologies’ markets following a strong 2006 performance. Dover targets 5-7% organic growth over a business cycle and has averaged 9% organic growth over the past five years.
As the title of this year’s Annual Report indicates, 2007 was a year of “Sharp- ening our Focus.” Consistent with that theme, we continued to build on key stra- tegic initiatives to enhance the value of our company longer term. First, we further simplified Dover’s organizational structure by aligning our operating companies into four market-focused segments with six core business Platforms. Second, we reas- sessed our capital allocation priorities resulting in an aggressive share repurchase program to drive value for our shareholders. Lastly, we continued to expand and develop the pool of executive talent to sustain Dover’s future success.
New Segment Alignment Provides Clarity
As I became Chief Executive Officer in January 2005, we embarked on a thorough review of our operating company portfolio, focusing on higher margin

 companies with significant growth opportunities. We have transitioned away from our historic capital equipment companies and placed emphasis on increasing our global footprint with companies that have a broader array of customers and served markets as well as significant recurring revenue opportunities. By the middle of 2007, it was clear that we had essentially accomplished our objective, having sold or discontinued 22 businesses and redeployed the proceeds of these sales into 20 new businesses that fit our long term growth objectives.

Another Strong Year For Our Shareholders, Customers And Employees
          In September, Dover completed its evolution into a much more strategically fo-
cused company. We are now organized into four “end market” segments, Industrial
Products, Engineered Systems, Fluid Management and Electronic Technologies, 2,000 which are further divided into six strategic platforms. We firmly believe this new
structure significantly clarifies the direction of Dover’s future growth, identifies the
priorities for allocation of our capital resources, focuses our acquisition program
and improves the oversight management of our operating companies. The new
alignment facilitates increased opportunities for sharing best practices and pro-
vides the framework for our management teams to capture synergistic savings to
increase future results.

   Strong Cash Flow Supports Capital Allocation Flexibility
Dover once again produced free cash flow in excess of 10% of revenue. Our strong cash flow, coupled with a high-priced acquisition environment, caused us to reassess our capital allocation priorities. Historically, Dover has produced sufficient free cash flow to fund its internal growth initiatives and maintain a fifty-two year record of annually increasing its cash dividend – the fourth-longest record on the New York Stock Exchange. 2007 was no exception as we increased our annual shareholder dividend by 8%.
Acquisition spending has historically averaged 9% of sales. However, in 2007, we elected to invest $274 million (3.8% of sales) on value-creating, add-on acquisi- tions that offer synergistic products and expand the served markets within our existing platforms.
We also announced two successive share repurchase programs totaling ap- proximately $1 billion. When completed, these repurchase programs will reduce Dover’s outstanding share count by roughly 10%. In 2007, the company repur- chased 12.4 million shares for $591 million.
We will continue to re-evaluate the allocation of Dover’s free cash flow among cash dividends, strategic acquisitions and share repurchases to enhance the value creation for our shareholders, and we strongly believe we have the capacity to pursue all three.
Quest For Synergy Opportunities
One of the most significant outcomes of the new segment alignment is the enthusiasm of our operating companies to evaluate and implement a wide range of synergy opportunities. These fall into three broad categories -- facility consolida-

 tions, business integrations and aggregated global sourcing. In 2007, we named a corporate level Director of Supply Chain to facilitate our efforts to maximize cost saving opportunities and to unify and strengthen the global reach of our supply chain efforts. Domestically and internationally, our companies are combining facilities
to improve their operating leverage and expedite their global expansion. Business integration efforts are being pursued to enable the use of common distribution plat- forms, leverage similar customer bases and utilize related manufacturing resources to drive future savings within individual businesses. Robust synergistic initiatives are developing within the Energy Platform, the Product Identification Group and the Fluid Solutions Platform. We have confidence that these efforts will generate 4-6% improvement in operating earnings over the next two years.
Positive Change Creates New Opportunities
The past three years have been very dynamic as we rationalized our portfolio
of operating companies and realigned our businesses into four end-market focused segments. I want to commend the talented and creative employees of Dover who produced our record 2007 performance and embraced our new organizational structure. Their sincere dedication to improving Dover’s performance and adapting to change gives me great confidence in their ability to meet the unique challenges of 2008.
One of the critical elements of our success is the leadership that has made this possible and, in that regard, I want to make note of some transitions that are occur- ring. First, two of our past subsidiary leaders, Tim Sandker and Ralph Coppola, will be retiring. We owe them both a sincere thanks for their years of outstanding service to Dover. Recognizing that strong management talent is critical, we have promoted Tom Giacomini and Soma Somasundaram as Presidents of the Material Handling and Fluid Solutions Platforms, respectively. Both are actively engaged in their new posi- tions and we look forward to their contributions to Dover’s future success.
Equally important, we have added to the Dover Board of Directors Thomas J. Derosa, a former Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of The Rouse Company, and Peter T. Francis, Chairman, President and CEO of J.M. Huber Corporation. We look forward to their advice and counsel as we continue to refine Dover’s overall strategic direction and future growth.
Last, and by no means least, Tom Reece has decided not to stand for re-election to the Board at the shareholder’s meeting in May. Tom’s career has spanned over forty years with Dover, as an operating company president at three companies, es- tablishing and running one of Dover’s original subsidiaries, and rising to the key role of Dover’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Tom has also served as Chairman of the Board of Dover since 1999. In all these capacities, Tom has displayed great leadership and wisdom and has been a champion for Dover’s culture, particularly emphasizing the highest levels of integrity and dedication to the organization. His wise counsel and participation will be sorely missed and we wish him well as he pursues family and philanthropic interests.

 Looking Forward To Continued Growth
Our business leaders forecast 2008 to be another year of growth and improved results for Dover. The majority of our companies enter the year with a positive out- look, solid backlogs and exciting new products to serve their customers. Dover’s re-energized portfolio of companies emphasizes higher growth and higher-margin markets, such as Energy, Product Identification and Fluid Solutions. In addition to these portfolio enhancements, our increased focus on maximizing recurring revenue opportunities and leveraging synergy gives us confidence that we have set the foundation for growing Dover’s results in 2008.
As we continue “Sharpening our Focus,” we strongly believe in the positive direction Dover is headed and are confident our new structure, more flexible capital allocation model, synergy initiatives and executive talent development lay a solid framework for future growth. We anticipate increased opportunities to expand our platforms with strategic organic growth initiatives coupled with value-creating, add- on acquisitions. The global engagement of Dover’s operating companies and their commitment to “PERFORMANCECOUNTS” will serve our shareholders well in the coming years.
Sincerely,
Ronald L. Hoffman
President and Chief Executive Officer February 28, 2008
