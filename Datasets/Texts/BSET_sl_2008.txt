TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS 2008 was another turbulent year for the furniture industry and for Bassett. We remain in the midst of a weak economy that continues to plague home furnishings sales across every geographic region in the U.S. Although 2009 has started out even tougher than last year, we believe that the Company's focus on capital preservation will enable Bassett to prosper when the economy eventually improves. Net sales for 2008 were $288 million compared to $295 million in 2007, a decrease of 2%. 2008 was a 53 week year while 2007 was 52 weeks. Also, as previously discussed, the change to landed pricing in July 2007 made for a positive comparison in sales from 2008 to 2007. Without the additional freight revenue, sales would have declined by 6% on a year over year comparison. Bassett recorded a net loss of $40.4 million or $3.46 per share in 2008 versus $9.9 million or $.84 per share in 2007. After adjusting for certain unusual items, our adjusted net loss was $11.4 million or $.97 per share in 2008 as compared to $2.6 million or $.22 per share in 2007. The table below summarizes those unusual items on an after-tax basis:

Also noteworthy in 2008 were charges of pretax bad debt expense of $11.8 million compared to $3.9 million in 2007, primarily related to licensee owned Bassett Home Furnishing stores. The financial health of several of our licensees came into question during the second half of 2008 as the poor economy took its toll. Accordingly, 18 stores were closed in 2008, 16 licensed and 2 corporate. As 2009 unfolds, we continue to work closely with all of our licensees to provide a strong product assortment and marketing assistance to enable them to generate sales during a period of nationwide economic stress. We expect to close another 10 to 12 stores in 2009 and could acquire additional licensee stores as well. At year end, the Bassett network was comprised of 84 licensed and 31 corporate stores. Despite the expenses associated with the closing of 2 stores and the extensive damage suffered from Hurricane Ike, our corporate stores improved their performance in 2008. Three stores were converted to the new prototype format and three more underwent extensive remodeling during the course of the year. Gross margins improved by 250 basis points primarily due to improved pricing strategies and reductions in distressed product discounts. The organizational strength of our corporate retail group markedly improved in 2008 which helped to provide an overall 2% same store sales increase while much of the industry experienced double digit declines. The preservation and generation of cash is our major focus for 2009. Building on initiatives started in 2008, the Company plans to further reduce inventory, trim payroll, and eliminate non-essential spending throughout the upcoming year. Accordingly, the Company has recently announced the suspension of its 401k employee match program and of its quarterly dividend, unfortunately interrupting a 74 year history of returning capital directly to shareholders. Once again, Bassett is committed to "do what it takes" to survive our industry's darkest hour and to be able to take advantage of a different looking furniture landscape as we ultimately emerge from the depths of this historic period of recession. I close by thanking our shareholders, our 1300 associates, and our customers for their collective support in 2008.
