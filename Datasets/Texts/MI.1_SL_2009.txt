 To Our Shareholders
 Dennis Kuester, Chairman Mark Furlong, President and CEO
March 12, 2010
2009 was a difficult year for your Company. Our focus during the year was on addressing credit
challenges and maintaining strong capital and liquidity. While it was difficult to incur losses throughout the year, we are confident that our strategies of aggressively dealing with problem credits and selling problem assets will better position us to emerge from this cycle in a position of strength.
M&I’s loan portfolio continued to be negatively affected by losses related to the recession and the housing downturn, especially in Arizona. However, we continue to make significant progress in reducing the concentration of construction and development loans within our portfolio and proactively removing problem loans from our balance sheet. At the end of 2009, these loans represented 12.5 percent of total loans, down from a high of 23 percent in 2007 and closer to our goal of less than 10 percent. We are confident the processes in place today will ensure that we will not become too heavily concentrated in any one area of lending going forward.
We were pleased that the positive trends in credit quality we began to experience earlier in the year continued into the fourth quarter:
• Non-performing loans and leases decreased to 4.62 percent of total loans and leases by the end of 2009, down 15 percent from mid-year.
• Early-stage delinquencies – those loans 30 - 89 days past due – are now at their lowest level since 2007.
• We are encouraged by the positive trends we are seeing with regard to inflows to nonaccrual loans since peaking in the second quarter.
• Non-performing construction and development loans have decreased in each of the last three quarters.
• Construction and development loans in Arizona are down 64 percent from their high in 2007 and non-performing loans in this portfolio are down 53 percent from their high in 2009.
• Delinquent commercial real estate loans are improving at a time when our industry is experiencing rising levels of delinquencies.
These positive indicators were the result of a focused strategy first initiated more than two years ago, realizing we have not yet seen the benefits of an improving economy. M&I ended the year
with demonstrated strength and growth in many other areas as well:
• At the end of the year, M&I’s loan loss reserve was 3.35 percent of total loans and leases – nearly $1 billion more than the first quarter of 2008.
• Net interest margin increased in the fourth quarter, setting the stage for a better 2010.
• Trust assets under management and administration were at all-time highs of $33 billion
and $122 billion, respectively, at the end of 2009.
 Annual Report to Shareholders | One

 • Seven Marshall Funds were ranked in the top quartile in their Lipper peer group for three and five years.
• 2009 average savings and NOW account deposits were $4.9 billion, growth of more than 52 percent over 2008, reflecting strong growth through the introduction of the M&I Platinum Savings account.
• 2009 average non-interest bearing deposits (checking accounts) were $7.4 billion, an increase of more than 26 percent over 2008.
M&I continues to extend new credit to new and existing customers. Since the infusion of
capital from the U.S. Treasury, M&I has extended more than $35 billion of new and renewed credit, including more than $6 billion in new credit. While we look forward to paying back all of the capital we received through the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Purchase Program, at this time, the regulatory and economic environments are requiring higher levels of capital than mandated by law. Therefore, paying back these funds will likely not occur in 2010. As the Corporation returns to profitability, however, we will be able to plan for not only returning Capital Purchase Program funds, but also increasing our common stock dividend.
We hope the quarterly shareholder letters you have been receiving have given you valuable perspective on our progress during the past two challenging years. Our goal is to ensure that, through those communications and this annual letter, you are well informed regarding our ongoing efforts to further strengthen your Corporation.
We continue to focus on building our core businesses, and on the pages that follow we have detailed the results of our efforts to do so throughout 2009. These successes support our focus on remaining committed to our corporate mission, maintaining a strong customer focus, and investing in our future.
As we transition to 2010, our focus on resolving credit issues continues to be critical. However, as the economy shows signs of improving, we are also planning for what our company will look like in the months and years ahead. Our strengthened position at the end of 2009 sets the stage for our success going forward.
The foundation we have laid for the future is one based on solid fundamentals, a strong relationship banking model, and an ongoing commitment to meeting the needs of our shareholders, customers, employees, and our communities. Although we share your disappointment in M&I’s stock price, we are dedicated to our efforts to return to profitability and to again offer long-term shareholder value.
Sincerely,
Mark F. Furlong Dennis J. Kuester President and CEO Chairman
