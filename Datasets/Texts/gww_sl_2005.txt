W.W. GRAINGER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Our Fellow Shareholders
   In 2005, Grainger reached new heights: record sales of $5.5 billion, net earnings of $346 million, and diluted earnings per share of $3.78, up 21 percent versus 2004. We generated $433 million of operating cash, and with that
cash made investments to grow our business while returning $220 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Our goal is to profitably grow the business by continuously improving customer service while increasing internal efficiencies. Reliable service delivered quickly and accurately is key to our growth.
Dependable service requires a knowledgeable sales force to help customers find the best solution, a broad product line to solve multiple problems, well-designed catalogs and Web sites to help customers navigate to products quickly and easily, an efficient supply chain to deliver those products quickly with high availability, and an integrated system to tie together the millions of customers, thousands of products and hundreds of locations. These capabilities fuel our steady growth.
Many accomplishments contributed to our success in 2005. Here are some of the most important:
• We completed the design and testing of a new SAP system in 2005, and implemented it in January 2006 for most of the U.S. business. In 2006, we will continue to work on the implementation of SAP for operations in Mexico and Canada to create a single North American platform.
• Our market expansion program strengthened our presence in 15 of the top U.S. metropolitan markets, with more markets to come in 2006.

“Customer service
is our passion and our path to enhanced shareholder value.”
• We expanded our sales force by more than 450 representatives throughout the United States to grow sales with even more customers. Our stratified sales coverage builds deeper relationships with thousands of customers. We will continue to further penetrate customer accounts in 2006 thanks to the improved focus of our sales force.
• By sourcing select products from 25 countries around the globe and refining our product line review process, we improved gross profit margins
in 2005. Beginning in 2006, we are aggressively expanding our product line to give customers more reasons
to come to Grainger.
• We added 33 sales representatives in Mexico as we continued to grow strongly. To keep the momentum going in 2006, we plan to extend our reach by further expansion of our branch coverage.
• Sales at our Canadian business, Acklands – Grainger Inc., grew aided by a robust natural resource extraction industry and a strong Canadian dollar. This business’ systems and processes need to be improved in order to deliver appropriate returns, so our focus in 2006 and 2007 is to integrate this business onto the SAP platform.
• Lab Safety Supply acquired the AW Direct business. The acquisition of this $28 million direct marketer
of products to the service vehicle accessories market further expands our customer file and leverages product lines. We continue to seek attractive acquisitions that are accretive to the business. Early in 2006 we acquired the business of Rand Materials Handling Equipment Co., a $16 million direct marketer of material handling and packaging products.

In closing, I’d like to welcome three new board members: William Hall, co-founder of Procyon Technologies, Inc.; Stuart Levenick, Group President of Caterpillar Inc.; and Michael Roberts, President and Chief Operating Officer
of McDonald’s Corporation. In addition to the current members, the board has proposed a new member, V. Ann Hailey, Executive Vice President of Limited Brands, Inc., who will stand for election at the 2006 annual meeting.
Our team has talent, heart and
the drive to win. And we are nowhere near done. I’d like to thank the 16,732 employees who make Grainger the place to go for the ones who get it done.

• We began to build a distribution presence in China, a market which represents approximately $30 billion in facilities maintenance products. In 2006, we plan to open a distribution center in Shanghai and launch a catalog with about 20,000 products.
We plan to continue to use our strong cash flow to benefit shareholders by making strategic investments that grow the business, increasing dividends and repurchasing shares.
Grainger also gave back to the community in ways that we are uniquely equipped to do. After the devastating hurricanes and other natural disasters in 2005, Grainger employees provided customers with what they needed to get back up and running. Beyond serving customers, employees contributed both time and money to help those affected. That’s why we received the Circle of Humanitarians Award from the American Red Cross.
Looking ahead, Grainger is positioned for continued success.
Our goals for 2006 and beyond reflect our ongoing efforts to strengthen our service offering and gain market share.
