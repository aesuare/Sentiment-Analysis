Letter to Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholders: I'm pleased to report that Avery Dennison delivered another solid financial performance in 2013, as we made excellent progress toward our long-term strategic and financial goals. For the second consecutive year, we recorded a doubledigit increase in earnings per share (EPS), driven by strong organic sales growth, continued productivity gains (including the impact of the restructuring program we began in 2012), and accretion from share repurchases. Once again we generated strong free cash flow, which enabled us to repurchase 6.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock and increase our quarterly dividend. In addition, we completed the sale of Office and Consumer Products and Designed and Engineered Solutions in mid-2013, which yielded approximately $390 million in net proceeds.

The sale marked a major milestone in the transformation of Avery Dennison. Several years of reshaping our portfolio and reorganizing our businesses have created a focused enterprise with a new baseline for our underlying cost structure, substantially improved operations and greater capital efficiency. As a result, we are on track to meet our targets for 2012-2015 sales and earnings growth and free cash flow (available in our investor presentation at www.investors.averydennison.com), and are well positioned to deliver growth and increased economic value over the long term. We have several reasons to be confident. First and foremost, we have significant competitive advantages. Our core businesses, Pressure-sensitive Materials (PSM) and Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS), are industry leaders with

high relative market share, economies of scale, strong innovation capabilities and leading positions in emerging markets. Our employees provide us with two more competitive advantages ­ our deep understanding of markets and customers, and nearly 80 years of technical expertise. They are uniquely equipped to offer powerful insights and collaborate with customers in developing products and solutions that meet their needs. In addition, they are superb manufacturers; we ended the year operating at some of the highest levels of reliability, quality and safety in our history. Our employees helped us advance our leadership in 2013, and I thank them for another great year. Pressure-sensitive Materials The Materials Group in our PSM segment delivered strong sales growth, even in economically challenged regions. We are the leading manufacturer of self-adhesive film and paper label materials, and a strong competitor in high-performance tapes and graphics and reflective materials. The global market for pressure-sensitive materials is large and growing, with many opportunities to help users of older wet-glue label technology evolve to our newer materials, which offer many design options, more varied and vivid printing, and higher application speeds. We plan to continue to use our strong customer relationships and expertise to accelerate innovation and drive top-line growth. Over the past three years, the Materials Group has launched more than 40 new products to address the needs of companies in end-markets such as food and beverage, home and personal care, and pharmaceuticals. In fact, more than one-third of our sales growth in 2013 came from innovation projects launched since 2011. We also intend to maintain PSM's excellent profit improvement trajectory. While we achieved operating margin at the high end of PSM's long-term target range in 2013, we are continuing to drive productivity improvements and reductions in material and manufacturing costs. We are investing for future growth and productivity as well, with plans to add new assets in Asia and consolidate graphics operations in Europe.

RBIS RBIS delivered another year of solid sales growth and margin expansion in 2013, and is on track to achieve its targets for 2015. RBIS is a unique provider of end-to-end solutions for the apparel industry, with branding solutions such as graphic tags, packaging, labeling and embellishments, and information management solutions, including inventory tracking and routing, price management, loss prevention and brand protection. As the clear industry leader in terms of scale, global presence, and breadth of product offerings, we create value by helping brand owners and retailers more effectively present their brands and simplify the complex processes of their fragmented, dispersed supply chains. We are gaining share in the core business with key global apparel brands and in new and emerging markets. We are also driving the growth of two powerful innovations: exterior embellishment technology, which offers designers a more creative alternative to traditional screen printing, and radio-frequency identification (RFID). We are the global leaders in RFID-based inventory and loss prevention solutions for apparel retailers, serving more customers with more systems in place than all other providers combined. Last year we increased RFID sales by 24%, and we expect growth to continue. According to RFID expert Dr. William Hardgrave, founder of the RFID Research Center at Auburn University, 20 of the top 30 U.S. retailers are now testing or already using RFID, and several European retailers are installing new systems as well. Retailers are also starting to use RFID to develop "omni-channel" marketing, which combines online and in-store shopping to improve consumers' overall experience. These are early steps in the development of the "Internet of Things," in which billions of RFID-connected objects communicate with one another and operate with minimal human intervention. RBIS has made excellent progress on operating efficiency and productivity. We have reduced our manufacturing square footage by nearly 20% since 2011, and

at the same time increased service reliability levels to an all-time high while reducing customer complaints to an all-time low. Key investments in RBIS include RFID and heat transfer assets to support the growth and productivity of these innovations. We also have increased our digital printing capacity by 60% over the past two years, which is enabling us to meet customer requirements for faster turnaround times with higher quality, consistency and efficiency. We now produce over one third of our graphic tags and labels digitally, and aim to exceed 50% by the end of 2015. Sustainability and Value Creation Avery Dennison has made substantial progress in becoming more sustainable, with greener operations and products, enhanced workplace environments and improved profitability. More important is our recognition that sustainability is a form of value creation that can contribute to our long-term financial performance. Not only is becoming more sustainable the right thing to do, it is the smart thing. Manufacturing more efficiently uses less material and creates less waste, reducing our environmental impact as well as our costs. Teams of engaged employees are more productive and creative, and make their workplaces more profitable. As competition increases for natural resources ­ including the wood pulp, petroleum and chemicals from which we manufacture our products ­ using renewable resources and finding lower-impact alternatives now can help ensure access to materials in the future. And as consumers take to social media to express their concern about the origin and composition of the products they purchase and the conditions in which they are manufactured, all companies will need to become more transparent about their supply chains. That is why we are taking the lead on responsibly sourcing materials, particularly paper. We are increasing the amount of Forest Stewardship Council-certified paper we purchase. With our scale and efficiencies, we are able to offer FSCbased materials at prices comparable to those of conventional constructions and influence the entire labeling and packaging industry. We also are working with our customers in the apparel industry to ensure that they recognize our high standards for workplace safety and other conditions around the world.

Most important of all, sustainability is stimulating a great deal of innovation. New products such as thinner label materials, new adhesive formulations that enable PET plastic recycling, and heat transfer technology for exterior embellishments have less impact on the planet than the products they replace, and can have impact far beyond their direct uses by making recycling easier and more cost-effective. Sustainability is a logical extension of our vision to help customers make brands more inspiring and the world more intelligent. And it is consistent with a basic economic truth: businesses are created to provide solutions for unmet needs. If we innovate to meet a societal need, we will reap the business benefit for shareholders. Viewing our enterprise through the lens of sustainability is pointing us toward new ways to advance our leadership and create long-term value. Transitions This April, Director John Cardis will retire from the Avery Dennison board of directors after 10 years of service. John has provided the board with financial expertise and a measured voice of reason on all matters, and I wish him the very best. Sustainable Performance Two years ago, we made specific commitments to investors on our financial strength, cost and capital discipline, and growth. With a second year of solid financial performance, we have made excellent progress. Our goal is to continue to deliver on these commitments in 2014. Thank you for your investment in Avery Dennison.
