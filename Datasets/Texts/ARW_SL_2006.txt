To Our Shareholders:
Our 2006 results represent another remarkable year of achievement for us – a year in which we posted record sales revenue of $13.6 billion, an increase of nearly 22 percent from 2005.
Since I first reported Arrow’s results to you more than four years ago, we have made steady progress across the four pillars of our business strategy – growth, operational excellence, financial stability and shared leadership. Our long-term commitment to this strategy continues to deliver results. In four years, our compound annual growth rate has reached nearly 17 percent, and our return on invested capital has more than tripled, from 3.4 percent to 11.4 percent.

In 2006, Arrow Electronics:
• Grew sales by nearly 22 percent, from $11.2 billion in 2005 to $13.6 billion
• Increased operating income from $491 million in 2005 to $622 million, an increase of nearly 27 percent*
• Generated net income per share of $2.92, compared with $2.18 in 2005*
• Delivered a return on invested capital of 11.4 percent, with the result that our return on invested capital has exceeded our cost of capital for 12 consecutive quarters
• Reduced long-term debt to $977 million, a more than 14 percent decrease compared with 2005.
We continue to lead our industry in key financial metrics, grow sales faster than the market and increase our earnings faster than sales. In any business, sales growth that exceeds market growth comes from exceeding customer expectations. At Arrow, that begins with:
• Listening to what our customers and suppliers say about their needs and expectations of us;
• Understanding what we must do as an organization to respond with the right supply chain tools and services; and
• Delivering what our customers and suppliers need to succeed, on a local, regional and global basis.
Our more than 140,000 customers and 600 suppliers worldwide rely on Arrow for the technical design, materials management, inventory planning and manufacturing services they need to bring electronic components and enterprise computing solutions to market. As we listen, understand
and deliver, we are well positioned to capture growth opportunities in both our Global Components and Enterprise Computing Solutions businesses.
Growing in Electronic Components
In response to the increasingly global nature of our customers and suppliers, we formed Arrow Global Components and appointed Michael J. Long, an Arrow executive with more than 20 years of experience, as president. Our worldwide electronic components business posted record sales in 2006 of $10.8 billion, a more than 22 percent increase compared with 2005. Each major regional electronic components business, now part of Arrow Global Components, gained market share and grew both sales and operating income.
Arrow Asia/Pacific serves a booming regional economy
that already accounts for nearly 50 percent of worldwide electronic components consumption. In the region, we are a local distributor with global capabilities – a combination that has driven sales to nearly $2.4 billion in 2006, a more than 62 percent increase from 2005. Our combined Asia/Pacific sales in the second half of 2006 exceeded our entire 2004 sales in the region. With the successful 2005 acquisition of Ultra Source Technology Corporation, we expanded our presence in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China, adding four sales offices and two warehouses to our more than 35 facilities that serve customers in Greater China.
In North America, we continue to target market segments where we see growing demand for electronic technology. In 2006, we formed three new groups to capitalize on opportunities in the high-brightness light emitting diodes
We continue to lead our industry in key financial metrics, grow sales faster than the market and increase our earnings faster than sales. In any business, sales growth that exceeds market growth comes from exceeding customer expectations.

 (HB-LEDs), industrial and transportation market segments. The lighting segment alone is expected to double in sales by 2010; the industrial segment will grow by 10 percent in 2007; and the automotive semiconductor segment indicators show increases of six percent annually through 2010. By listening to the distinct needs of our customers across all market segments, North American Components posted sales results of $4.7 billion, an increase of 12 percent compared with 2005.
Throughout 2006, Europe saw improved economic conditions and continued movement of manufacturing to Eastern Europe. The Eastern European distribution market alone grew at a compound annual rate of 24 percent during the past four years. Capitalizing on these opportunities, our European business grew its revenues to $3.6 billion,
an increase of more than 18 percent from 2005. 2006
also marked a milestone in Europe that affected our customers globally as the European Union implemented its environmental regulations for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS). During the past several years, Arrow worked with customers and suppliers to ensure a smooth transition to meeting these guidelines.
Growing in Enterprise Computing Solutions
Our Enterprise Computing Solutions business has expanded from North America to Europe. The value-added resellers (VARs) it serves provide computing solutions to a wide range of end markets, spanning from small local governments to large financial institutions to almost any enterprise that requires a server, data storage or software solution.
In 2006, revenues from Enterprise Computing Solutions grew to $2.5 billion, a more than 22 percent increase compared with our 2005 results. In 2005, we embarked
on an acquisition strategy with the goal of expanding our global presence as well as the breadth of the computing solutions we offer. To lead our continued growth, we named Kevin J. Gilroy and M. Catherine Morris to a newly created office of the president for Enterprise Computing Solutions.
In 2005, we began our expansion of this business with the acquisition of DNSint.com AG, based in Munich, Germany. We continued in 2006 with the acquisition of InTechnology plc’s storage and security distribution business, headquartered in Harrogate, England. With the completion of these acquisitions, Enterprise Computing Solutions now serves resellers in 17 countries.
In 2006, we also extended our strong position in North America. In Canada, we acquired SKYDATA Corporation, the country’s largest distributor of EMC2 brand data storage products. With the acquisition of Alternative Technology, Inc. based in Englewood, Colorado, we increased our ability to serve VARs with software solutions that optimize, accelerate, monitor and secure an end-user’s network.
In early 2007, we announced our planned acquisition, subject to customary closing conditions, of the Agilysys KeyLink Systems Group (KeyLink), a leading enterprise computing solutions distributor with headquarters in Cleveland, Ohio. The addition of KeyLink will strengthen our partnerships with International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) and Hewlett-Packard Company (HP), and create a new partnership with Oracle Corporation.

 Our nearly 12,000 Arrow employees throughout the world work each day to listen, understand and to deliver the products and services that create value for our customers and suppliers.
This expansion of our Enterprise Computing Solutions business places us in a strong position to capitalize on the fastest growing segment in enterprise computing – resellers that serve small-to-medium sized end customers. With a broader portfolio of hardware, storage, software and services, we have created new cross-selling opportunities and diversified our revenue stream.
Moving Forward
Our commitment to continuous improvement in every aspect of our operations depends on our ability to listen, understand and deliver as One Arrow. In 2006, we launched a multi-year initiative to develop a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform. During the next several years, our ERP initiative will move our best practices in common services and processes – from pricing to shipping – to one global system.
Beyond systems, operational excellence is driven by continuous process improvements (CPI). Our CPI program, now in its second year, has more than 1,300 green belt and black belt certified employees who have applied Lean Six Sigma principles company-wide to improve our ability to deliver customer satisfaction.
We continue to look for ways to improve in everything we do, and our hard work and accomplishments continue to be appreciated by those we serve. In 2006, we received more than 75 acknowledgements and awards from our customers, suppliers and other organizations.
These recognitions reflect the progress we made in 2006 toward our goal of becoming the clear number one provider of products, services and solutions to our industry. Our nearly 12,000 Arrow employees throughout the world work each day to listen, understand and to deliver the products and services that create value for our customers and suppliers.
Our 2006 results show a company on the move – a company working successfully behind a solid strategy, addressing the needs of the business and the interests of our shareholders. I look forward to reporting to you in the year ahead.
