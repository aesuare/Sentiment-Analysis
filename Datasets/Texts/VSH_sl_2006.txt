 To Our Shareholders, Employees, Customers, and Vendors
 year 2006 was the second best year in Vishay’s history. In terms of operational performance, only the bubble year of 2000 was better, thanks in large part to very temporary price increases. We are excited about the acquisition of discrete semiconductor and module product lines from International rectifier, which will expand Vishay’s product portfolio significantly. We expect that the acquisition will be accretive to earnings during 2007, thus further strengthening Vishay’s financial performance.
Our accomplishments during 2006 in the areas of product development, cost reduction, and customer satisfaction will help to drive future Company growth. We anticipate that 2007 will be another good year for Vishay.
Year 2006
Vishay’s revenues for 2006 were $2.58 billion, an increase of 12% compared to 2005. Net earnings per share for 2006 were $0.73, compared to $0.34 in 2005. Adjusted net earnings per share for
2006 were $0.99, compared to $0.51 in 2005. the adjustments are relat- ed to restructuring and severance costs, write-downs of fixed assets, and other items. (for more details about the adjustments, see the table on the inside front cover.) During 2006, cash generated from opera- tions was $349 million, compared to $203 million during 2005.
Vishay’s historically strong cash
generation has provided money to
acquire product lines and invest in
production expansion. the result is
a 20% compound annual growth rate
of revenues during the past 20 years.
In the process, Vishay has become a truly international company — a leader in the global electronics industry that sells into all geographic markets and all relevant market segments.
In November 2006, Vishay announced its intention to acquire selected discrete semiconductor and module product lines from International rectifier. the acquisition of these product lines, which had an annual run rate of revenues of approximately $320 million at the end of 2006, closed in April 2007. the acquisition represents a continuation of the successful acquisition strategy Vishay began two decades ago and further expands and complements Vishay’s wide range of product offerings. the acquisition has provided products that are new to Vishay: high-voltage planar mOSfets; high-power diodes, rectifiers, and thyristors; and automotive modules and assemblies. It also has added manufacturing plants in Italy, the UK, China, and India. We expect that this acquisition will yield an excellent return on investment.
Vishay’s capital spending during 2006 was $183 million, 60% of which was for capacity expansion. At the wafer fab in Itzehoe, Germany, we continued the transition
from 6-inch wafers to more profitable 8-inch wafers for Vishay Siliconix products. We finalized the move to larger wafers for PIN diodes at the heilbronn, Germany plant, and are planning similar moves for other Vishay semiconductor products. We expanded production capacity at the Siliconix back-end facility in Shanghai, China, and at Vishay’s state-of-the-art facility in tianjin, China, where Vishay assembles and tests rectifiers.
Vishay continued planned restructuring efforts during 2006 at Company facilities in Belgium, the Netherlands, hungary, Germany, and other countries. employment in high-labor-cost countries was reduced from 27.2% of the total Vishay workforce as of December 31, 2005, to 25.8% as of December 31, 2006. Our long-term target is 20–25%.
Vishay’s major restructuring projects, underway for several years, are now largely completed. We expect restructuring costs of less than $10 million during 2007, compared to $40 million during 2006.
Vishay’s long-term purchase commitment for tantalum powder expired in 2006. Vishay had signed this purchase commitment when market demand for tantalum capacitors was high and tan- talum powder was in short supply. As a result, Vishay was forced to accumulate large inventories of tantalum powder. Now, by reducing purchases of tantalum powder and using accumulated tantalum raw material, Vishay will have an increased cash flow of approximately $100 million over the next three years.
Vishay’s focus on r&D continued to reap rewards during 2006. A few examples:
• Vishay Siliconix mICrO fOOt® products are 70% smaller than standard products with similar performance — an important benefit when used in mobile phones and other small handheld devices. Sales of mICrO fOOt power mOSfets and power ICs, increased from approximately $23 million in 2005 to approximately $42 million in 2006, and we expect this growth to continue.
• Vishay’s patented, novel power inductor already had substantial sales in 2006. Vishay recently signed an agreement with toko, a major Japanese inductor manufacturer, for royalty payments to Vishay. there are a number of other companies interested in this market, and Vishay has started discussions with these companies.
• Vishay has taken the patented trench technology used in Vishay Siliconix mOSfets and used it in a new series of tmBSTM rectifiers that reduce power losses and improve efficiency in computing, telecommunications, and other applications. this is an example of using a technology developed in one

division and applying it to products in a different division. Vishay’s tmBS rectifiers generated sales of approximately $10 million in 2006, and we expect this to increase by 50% in 2007.
Financial Highlights
Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $2,581.5 million compared to $2,296.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $139.7 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, compared with net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2005 of $62.3 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings for 2006 and 2005 were $196.1 million and $92.9 million respectively, or $0.99 and $0.51 per diluted share.
Vishay continued to generate cash from operations during 2006. for the year ended December 31, 2006, the Company’s cash flow from operations was $349.5 million. Purchases of property and equipment for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $183.3 million, and depreciation and amortization
for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $197.0 million. free cash (net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures) generated by Vishay in 2006 was $166.2 million, compared to $66.2 million in 2005. Our cash balance at December 31, 2006 was $671.6 million.
At December 31, 2006, the long-term debt of Vishay was $608.4 million (substantially all in convertibles), and stockholders’ equity was $3,080.8 million, resulting in a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.20.
Looking Ahead
New Vishay products introduced into the market during the past five years were responsible for approximately 26% of total Vishay sales. We estimate that, without taking into account any additional acquisitions, in the year 2010 approximately 36% of total Vishay sales will come from products that are less than five years old, and approximately 46% of Vishay semiconductor sales will come from products that are less than five years old. this is consistent with Vishay’s long-term commitment to growth through new products and technologies.
As noted above, revenues from our mICrO fOOt power mOSfets and power ICs nearly doubled between 2005 and 2006. they are 70% smaller than competing products, which makes them ideal for use on the cramped circuit boards inside cell phones, notebook computers, and other portable end products. Vishay is developing a new, more advanced mICrO fOOt model with high-power capabilities. the sales potential of Vishay’s advanced mICrO fOOt model will be far greater than that of its existing model.
What makes mICrO fOOt unique is the fact that it eliminates the package that typically encases silicon-
chip components. Vishay is now taking its packageless- chip technology and applying it to the Schottky diode, another type of discrete semiconductor that is widely used in electronic circuits. Like the new mICrO fOOt mOSfets and power ICs, Vishay’s new packageless Schottky diode provides the benefits of small size and high current-handling capability.
many other products are being developed in the r&D labs of Vishay’s 18 divisions and its corporate research center.
Because Vishay is reaching the end of its major restructuring programs, we expect that restructuring costs will be considerably less in 2007 than they were during 2006. meanwhile, the Company is increasing capacity for several important products. these include Vishay Siliconix high-cell-density products, for which we project a 20% volume increase during 2007. We expect that Vishay’s transition to 8-inch silicon wafer technology will have a positive impact on the bottom line.
Vishay generates substantial cash. Vishay has generated cash flows from operations in excess of $200 million in each of the past five years, and cash flows from operations in excess of $100 million in each of the past twelve years. Because of its strong balance sheet, Vishay is very well positioned to pursue new strategic acquisitions, invest in r&D throughout all its divisions, expand into new technologies, and thereby further strengthen its position as a global industry leader. As we look ahead to positive results during 2007, we express our gratitude to Vishay’s employees, customers, vendors, and strategic business partners,
and thank the Company’s shareholders for their ongoing support.
