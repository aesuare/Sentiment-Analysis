TO OUR SHARE HOLDERS
ANOTHER YEAR OF RECORD SALES & EARNINGS FOR GENUINE PARTS COMPANY
  We are pleased to report that 2013 was another
year of record sales and earnings for Genuine Parts Company. Total Company sales were $14.1 billion and this represents an 8% increase compared to 2012. Net earnings and earnings per share for the year were each up 6% to $685 million and $4.40, respectively, compared to 2012. Our overall results reflect the good job that was done by the GPC Team in 2013, despite the challenging market conditions that
were experienced by our non-automotive business segments. We are also pleased to report that the
total value of the Company increased nicely again in 2013, with our stock price increasing 30.8% for the year. This, combined with our dividend, gave us a total shareholder return of 34.5% in 2013.
FINANCIAL STRENGTH
Genuine Parts Company further strengthened its financial condition in 2013 with increased net income and a continued emphasis on effectively managing the balance sheet. Our ongoing asset management and working capital initiatives helped us to maintain a strong cash position, with cash of approximately $200 million at December 31, 2013. For
the year, cash from operations totaled a record $1.1 billion and, after dividends paid of $326 million and capital expenditures of $124 million, our free cash flow was approximately $600 million, also a new record
for us. At December 31, 2013, our total debt was $765 million, which represents a modest 19% of total capitalization.
ACQUISITIONS
During 2013, we acquired several new businesses, which positively impacted our overall results for the year. Effective April 1, 2013, the Company completed the purchase of the remaining 70% stake of Exego, which we subsequently renamed GPC Asia Pacific. The Company had previously purchased a 30% stake in this Melbourne, Australia based business on January 1, 2012. GPC Asia Pacific is a leading Australasian aftermarket distributor with 460 locations across Australia and New Zealand and annual revenues of approximately $1.1 billion (US$).
The Company’s Industrial Group made two strategic acquisitions, with the addition of AST Bearings on October 26, 2013, and Paragon Service and Supply on December 2, 2013. We expect the combined annual revenues for these value-add industrial distributors to approximate $50 million. Additionally, our Electrical/Electronic Group made two strategic acquisitions. Trient Technologies was acquired August 1, 2013, and Tekra Corporation was acquired October 31, 2013. Both of these businesses complement the fabrication capabilities at EIS and we expect their combined annual revenues to be approximately $85 million.
The Company has continued to add to its operations with three more acquisitions thus far in 2014. Effective January 31, 2014, the Industrial Group acquired Commercial Solutions, an industrial distributor based in Edmonton, Alberta, with expected annual revenue of approximately $100 million. Effective February 1, 2014, the Electrical/Electronic Group added Electro-Wire to its operations, which significantly expands its specialty wire and cable product offering. We expect the annual revenue for this business to approximate $100 million. Also effective February 1, 2014, the Office Products Group acquired Garland C. Norris Company, a regional wholesale distributor of food service disposables and janitorial and cleaning supplies. This acquisition will further diversify the S. P.
L-R: Paul D. Donahue President; Thomas C. Gallagher Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Carol B. Yancey Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
 Richards’ product offering into complementary, adjacent market channels and it will add approximately $35 million in annual revenues.
SHARE REPURCHASES
We repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares of our Company stock in 2013 and we continue to view this as a good use of our cash. As of December 31, 2013, we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional 10.7 million shares, and we expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases during 2014.
OPERATIONS
The Company’s revenue growth in 2013 was driven by strong sales results in our automotive business. Sales growth among our non- automotive businesses proved more challenging, as these businesses were impacted by relatively weak customer demand and soft industry fundamentals throughout most of the year. Acquisitions were integral to our overall growth in revenue for the year, contributing approximately 7% to 2013 sales.
The Automotive Group, our largest segment at 53% of 2013 revenues, reported a strong 18.5% sales increase for the year. The 2012 acquisition of Quaker City and the April 1, 2013 acquisition of the Australasian business drove the high-teens revenue growth. Our underlying sales were up approximately 4% for the year, driven by our commercial business and, in particular, solid results in NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, our two primary commercial initiatives. As we turn to 2014, the fundamentals supporting demand in the automotive aftermarket remain favorable and, combined with our internal growth initiatives, we are optimistic for another year of solid growth for our Automotive Group.
Motion Industries, our industrial distribution company, represents 31%
of our 2013 revenues. Sales for Motion in 2013 were down slightly
from the prior year, as weak demand patterns in select customer segments continued to challenge the industry. Looking ahead, the recent acquisitions for this business, as well as other internal growth initiatives and relatively stable manufacturing indicators, provide us with confidence for our Industrial Group in 2014. Staying within the manufacturing segment of the economy, EIS, our electrical/electronic distribution company, represents 4% of our 2013 revenues and showed sales down 2% for the year. This group was also impacted by slow market conditions in 2013 but, much like the industrial business, should benefit from
their internal growth initiatives and a gradually improving manufacturing

environment in 2014, as well as the incremental revenue from their recently completed acquisitions.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group, represents 12% of our 2013 revenues and had a 3% sales decrease for the year. The industry-wide weakness in office products consumption continues to pressure this segment, and we do not expect any meaningful improvement in these conditions in the near future. Our focus in 2014 will be on market share initiatives, product line extensions and further diversification of our product and customer portfolios.
GPC DIRECTORS
At the April 28, 2014 Shareholders’ Meeting, we are asking the shareholders to elect Gary P. Fayard as a new Director of the Company. Mr. Fayard joined the Coca-Cola Company in 1994 and has served as their Chief Financial Officer since 1999. Previously, Mr. Fayard served 19 years with Ernst & Young, where he was partner, area director of
audit services and area director of manufacturing services. Mr. Fayard’s financial background and broad business exposure will bring a wealth of knowledge to the Board and we look forward to having him serve with us.
MANAGEMENT
Over the last year, there were several key management changes and promotions that we would like to share with you. First, in September 2013, Timothy P. Breen was named President and Chief Operating Officer at Motion Industries, further expanding his management responsibilities within the company. Tim has served the industry
for more than 30 years and was most recently the Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Motion’s U.S. operations. His proven leadership skills and vast experience make him a good fit for this key position.
In March 2013, James R. Neill joined the GPC Corporate Human Resources organization as Senior Vice President of Employee Development and HR Services. Previously, Jim was the Senior Vice President of Human Resources for Motion Industries, a position he had filled quite admirably since 2008. Jim joined Motion in 2006 and has also served in a variety of other human resources roles over his distinguished career.
Additionally, we are pleased to tell you that at our February 2014 Board meeting, our Directors elected Mr. Neill to replace R. Bruce Clayton as
Senior Vice President of Human Resources for the Company, upon Bruce’s retirement on April 1, 2014. Bruce has been extremely valuable to our management team in his 18 years at GPC, and we want to thank him for his tremendous leadership and wish him the very best in his retirement. Likewise, we welcome Jim to this important role and look forward to his many future contributions.
CONCLUSION
In looking back, 2013 was an interesting year, with a number of challenges encountered in each of our four business segments. As previously stated, Automotive fared the best with their 18.5% sales increase. The non-automotive segments had the most difficult time and ended the year with a combined 1% sales decrease. However, in all four businesses key decisions were made and actions taken that position them for solid performances in the year ahead, and we look forward
to reporting on our progress as we move through the new year. We remain committed to our core objectives of growing sales and earnings, showing continued operating margin improvement, generating solid cash flows and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Further progress in each of these important areas will keep the Company moving ahead and they will help to ensure another successful year in 2014.
We want to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to our employees, customers, vendors and shareholders for their commitment to and ongoing support of Genuine Parts Company.
