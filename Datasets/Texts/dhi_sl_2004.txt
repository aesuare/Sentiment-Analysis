Dear Fellow Stockholders:
Our Company, America's Builder, just completed another record year, our 27th consecutive year of growth in revenues and proÑtability! As a result, for the third consecutive year, we maintained our position as the number one homebuilder in America by delivering more homes in the United States than any other homebuilder! Some of the records that America's Builder achieved this year included:
‚ Earning record net income of $975.1 million, a 56% increase over our Ñscal 2003 record of $626.0 million;
‚ Earning record diluted earnings per share of $4.11, a 51% increase over our 2003 record of $2.73;
‚ Achieving record revenues of $10.8 billion (43,567 homes delivered), a 24% increase over our 2003 record of $8.7 billion (35,934 homes delivered);
‚ Achieving gross proÑt margin on homebuilding revenues of 23.1%, a 270 basis point improvement over the 20.4% earned in 2003;
‚ Attaining a record level of stockholders' equity of $4.0 billion, up 31% from the 2003 level of $3.0 billion;
‚ Initiating record new sales orders, amounting to $11.4 billion (45,263 homes), a 24% increase over our 2003 record of $9.2 billion (38,725 homes);
‚ Being the Ñrst homebuilding company in the world to sell more than 45,000 homes in a year and to deliver more than 43,000 homes in a year;
‚ Holding a record year-end sales backlog of $4.6 billion (17,184 homes), up 25% over our 2003 year-end record of $3.7 billion (15,488 homes);
‚ Reducing our homebuilding leverage ratio (net of cash) to an all-time low of 38.9%, 1.1 percentage points less than last year's record level of 40.0%;
‚ Ending the Ñscal year with $1.6 billion in ""dry powder'', including $480.1 million in homebuilding cash and $1.1 billion unused capacity on our revolving credit facility, and
‚ Achieving a return on beginning stockholders' equity of 32% and on average stockholders' equity of 28%.
These accomplishments build on our history of out-performing our homebuilding industry competitors. We understand that, for America's Builder, nothing happens until a home is sold. As a result of that focus, our year-over-year percentage increases in homes sold during the period 1991-2004 exceeded the national rate of change in homes sold in every year! In three of those years, national sales were down, but our year- over-year sales increased each and every year!
One of the most signiÑcant factors that has allowed us to achieve such dramatic results is our realization that homebuilding is clearly a local business. Our division presidents are truly entrepreneurs, charged with the responsibility and given the authority to react to changes in their respective markets and adjust land positions, product and pricing as necessary. In addition, in many of our markets, we are and have always been willing to ""customize'' our production homes, making them more attractive to our home buyers. Finally, our division presidents are stockholders through direct stock ownership and through stock options. This ownership, coupled with an incentive bonus program that rewards bottom-line performance and eÇcient management of Company assets, ensures that management and stockholder interests are Ñrmly aligned. We are convinced that our decentralized structure, our ability to ""customize'' our production homes and our management incentive plans have allowed us to grow America's Builder through all economic cycles and gives us a competitive advantage in each of our markets.
We have historically grown through a balanced combination of internal growth and acquisitions. During the last two years, our growth has been wholly internal. Our Ñve-year compounded annual growth rate in revenues through Ñscal 2004 was 28%. While we are proud of our revenue growth, we are more focused on improving our proÑtability, which is reÖected by our 44% Ñve-year compounded annual growth rate in net income.
Last year, we suggested that we could achieve our $10 billion revenue target with organic growth only. We not only did so, we exceeded it by $841 million! As we enter Ñscal 2005, we believe that we can

generate approximately $12 billion in revenues, again solely through internal growth, by continuing to more deeply penetrate our existing markets and by expanding our already successful strategy of opening ""satellite'' operations in smaller markets adjacent to our existing operating divisions. Such satellite operations remain under the operational and administrative control of their nearby parent divisions, and consist solely of a city manager and construction and sales personnel. As we have consistently done in the past, we will continue to evaluate any attractive acquisition opportunities that may arise. Based upon our history of seventeen successful acquisitions, we have no doubt that we are capable of successfully identifying, acquiring and seamlessly integrating the operations of successful homebuilding companies into the Horton ""family.''
At September 30, 2004, our stockholders' equity was $4.0 billion, 31% higher than a year ago, and
1.3 million times the $3,000 with which I started the Company in 1978! Importantly, our homebuilding leverage, net of cash, declined from 40.0% at the end of Ñscal 2003 to 38.9% at the end of 2004, an improvement of 110 basis points! Our improvement in net homebuilding leverage in 2004 was achieved solely through a continued disciplined approach to land acquisitions, in which budgeted land deals were funded only to the extent that our operating divisions met or exceeded their budgeted revenue targets. We believe that all of our credit parameters are now at investment-grade levels and have been for more than a year.
Our strong balance sheet and our consistent ability to deliver superior operating results have generated strong acceptance of America's Builder by the capital markets. In January 2004, we issued $200 million in 5% senior notes due in 2009, part of the proceeds of which were used to redeem $150 million of our
83/8% senior notes that matured in June 2004. In July 2004, we issued $200 million in 61/8% senior notes due in 2014. In September 2004, we issued $250 million in 55/8% senior notes due in 2014, and in October 2004, we issued $250 million in 47/8% senior notes due in 2010. The latter issue was our Ñrst ever with an investment-grade covenant package, reÖecting the market's acceptance of our Company as an investment- grade issuer, even though, except for Fitch Ratings, the rating agencies have not yet formally recognized us as such. We had $113 million in letters of credit outstanding and no cash advances under our
$1.21 billion revolving credit line at September 30, 2004. The $1.1 billion in capacity under the credit line, plus the $480 million in homebuilding cash at year-end, give us $1.6 billion in ""dry powder'', and aÅord us ample resources to eÅect our growth strategies in Ñscal 2005 and beyond.
On December 1, 2003, we announced that our Board of Directors had declared a three-for-two stock split, to be eÅected as a 50% stock dividend, payable January 12, 2004, to stockholders of record on December 22, 2003. In Ñscal 2004, our quarterly cash dividend amounted to $.08 per share, up 71% adjusted for the eÅect of the January 2004 stock split. Although we made no stock repurchases in Ñscal 2004, our Board authorization for such repurchases remains at $175.6 million as of September 30, 2004. To the extent that our future operating cash Öows are positive, we will continue to evaluate the possibility of future share repurchases.
We thank all D.R. Horton stockholders for helping us build a company with a solid foundation and an exciting future. Although we are gratiÑed by the recent improvement in our stock's performance, we continue to believe that our stock is signiÑcantly undervalued. Since our June 1992 IPO, our twelve-year track record in revenue and earnings growth should be the envy of most so-called ""growth'' companies with larger price-earnings multiples than ours.
We also thank our dedicated employees, suppliers and subcontractors. They are the backbone of our success as America's Builder and provide us the ability to react quickly and make sound decisions. We look forward to a highly successful Ñscal 2005 as the largest and most proÑtable homebuilder in America!
