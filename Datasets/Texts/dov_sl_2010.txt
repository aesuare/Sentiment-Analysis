            “The extensive work undertaken to fundamentally improve and
position our businesses over the past two years has enabled Dover to build a solid foundation focused on strong and achievable growth.”
—Robert Livingston, President and CEO

 Dear Shareholders:
2010 was an excellent year for Dover, one in which we delivered broad- based gains in revenue, earnings, margins, bookings and backlog. All four segments contributed to our success, as each achieved double- digit sales growth and higher margins. Dover delivered record segment margins of 16.4%, and generated free cash flow of $767 million, representing 11% of rev- enue. For the year, revenue totaled $7.1 billion with earnings per share from continuing operations reach- ing $3.74. In addition, 2010 was also the 55th consecutive year that Dover increased its dividend, marking the fourth longest record on the New York Stock Exchange. I am delighted with these results and am equally pleased with the way our operating companies focused on key strategies around international expansion, product innovation and productivity.
Many factors contributed to our strong results in 2010. Not only did we leverage the benefits of an improving global economy, we also positioned Dover in front of significant tailwinds in several of our growth spaces. These tailwinds came in forms as varied as the booming demand for smart phones, shifts to shale drill- ing and the rising middle class in developing economies. Issues around sustainability and product safety also provided a bounce for our business. Internally, we continued to invest in productivity initiatives, product in- novation activities and expanding our markets. Lastly, we made important acquisitions to support strong growth in the future. The extensive work undertaken to fundamentally improve

Our Markets
All of our businesses were solidly profitable in the year, and many even set records. I am proud of each com- pany’s achievements and how well they’ve positioned themselves in their respective markets.
Industrial Products
Faced with a challenging marketplace over the last couple of years, Indus- trial Products greatly benefitted from the significant restructuring under- taken in 2008 and 2009. Through
the downturn, Industrial Products continued to invest in the future. Industrial Products added business development and engineering talent in targeted areas, knowing that busi-
ness, though generally later cycle, would eventually rebound and grow. Today, Industrial Products is a much stronger segment than it was just two years ago and is indeed beginning to benefit from a modest recovery in its end-markets. Evidence of this rests in the fact that revenue for the year in Industrial Products was $1.8 billion, up 14% from 2009 and earnings in this segment rose to $226 million, a 62% increase from the prior year.
With respect to our Material Handling platform, revenue increased significantly driven by improving infrastructure markets. Several of our companies serving the commercial construction and industrial automa- tion markets saw significant growth in 2010 as global industrial produc- tion began to recover.
At the Mobile Equipment platform, revenue growth was more modest,
as the gains they saw in automotive service and trailers were partially offset by soft military and refuse vehicle markets. We have kept our cost base low in this platform and expect to leverage improving end markets in 2011 and 2012 into mean- ingful earnings gains.
Engineered Systems
Engineered Systems posted a record year for orders, sales and earnings
in 2010. Key acquisitions made in 2009, most notably those of Tyler and Barker, have tactically positioned Engineered Systems to serve several large customers who were entering aggressive remodel programs. For the year, revenues totaled $2.2 billion, up 20% from the prior year, and earn- ings increased 33% to $302 million.
On the Engineered Products side, Hill PHOENIX, the largest company
   
                                                                                                                                    3
 in this platform, saw store remodels hit a 10-year high for supermarket chains. While store owners were not investing heavily in new stores, they updated and refreshed their existing properties and are continuing to
do so.
With regard to our Product Identi-
fication platform, marking and coding is following the improving trends in industrial production and consumer spending and benefitting from our investments in emerging markets. We saw double-digit revenue growth last year and expect new product offerings and the completion of their global in- tegration to position them even better as they enter 2011.
Fluid Management
Growing global industrial production and favorable oil and gas dynamics played a key role in Fluid Manage-
ment’s strong recovery in 2010, as revenues increased 29% to $1.6 billion and earnings rose 50% to $388 million. For the year, Fluid Manage- ment experienced a very solid 330 basis point margin improvement. We’re in attractive markets with solid growth potential and have the prod- ucts and capabilities to capture the multiple opportunities in front of us.
Our Energy platform was a major beneficiary of several strong growth trends in 2010, such as increased
rig count deployment, shifts to shale drilling and rising energy prices. Revenues in this platform grew more than 40%. US Synthetic, with its industry-leading diamond technology in drill bit inserts, grew its business through continued investment in production capacity and technology. Further, as oil and gas wells age around the world, reliance increases
on the artificial lift technologies of our Norris Production Solutions business to efficiently extract liquids from mature wells. In early 2011, we con- tinued to grow our artificial lift offer- ings with the acquisition of Harbison– Fischer, a maker of down-hole rod pumps which are often attached to Norris Production Solutions’ sucker rods in lift applications. This impor- tant acquisition expanded our product portfolio and will enable us to deliver a more complete rod lift solution to our customers on a global basis.
Our Fluid Solutions platform ben- efitted from the increasing demand for upgraded infrastructure world- wide. In addition, emerging trends in sustainability fueled the need for this segment’s highly efficient products and solutions that meet continu-
ally expanding regulations and “zero harm” standards. Even during less

 robust industrial market conditions like those felt in 2010, we were able to grow our sales substantially as cus- tomers value our solutions and trust our technology.
Electronic Technologies
Electronic Technologies led all seg- ments with a full year revenue growth rate of 39% to $1.4 billion and earn- ings growth of nearly 200% to $250 million. It also finished with record operating margins of 17.6%.
Our electronic test and assem-
bly companies, particularly Everett Charles, saw their markets rebound as Asian electronics manufacturers meaningfully invested in new equip- ment for the first time since 2006.
On the electronic components side, we saw increases at Knowles and in our businesses that serve telecom infrastructure and wireless communi- cations. Strong global demand for cell phones, particularly smart- phones, enabled Knowles to signifi- cantly grow the MEMS microphones business in 2010. We see this trend continuing. To help position Knowles even better in this dynamic mobile communications market, in De- cember we announced our intent to acquire Sound Solutions, a leading manufacturer of speakers and receiv- ers. This transaction is expected to close at the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2011.
Electronic Technologies also has made significant progress in expand- ing its served markets and becoming less reliant on semiconductor- related end markets. In total, Elec- tronic Technologies revenue derived from traditional electronic assembly and semicon-related markets has decreased from 63% a decade ago to
17% in 2010, with larger exposures now in life sciences, consumer elec- tronics and industrial applications.
Perhaps the best illustration of this diversifying strategy is DEK’s recent entrance into the solar equip- ment market. By adapting its core screen printing equipment to the needs of the rapidly growing solar market, DEK was able to attract global customers through leading edge technology and world class customer service. DEK’s total solar revenue went from essentially zero in 2009 to roughly $40 million in 2010, with strong growth expected for 2011.
Progress On Key Operational Initiatives
In 2010, we continued to focus on operational excellence in multiple ar- eas, including expansion in emerging markets and productivity.
Expansion in Emerging Markets
A key objective for Dover, and for me personally, has been to expand our activity and pursue new opportunities in emerging economies. The fourth quarter of 2010 marked the second consecutive quarter that our revenue from Asia exceeded our revenue in Europe. Full-year growth rates totaled 50% for Asia, while Latin America came in even higher at 52%. Through- out all of Dover, sales in emerging markets totaled in excess of 20%.
We’ve invested in sales and marketing in emerging economies
to raise our profile and to capture more local opportunities. Also, over the past two years, we have opened shared manufacturing centers in India, China and Brazil. These centers provide us with significant cost
savings and synergies as we capture additional market share by aligning the products we manufacture in these countries with their local markets.
Productivity
The key initiatives that support our productivity expectations include supply chain activities, lean efforts and facility consolidations. We began the supply chain journey in 2008 with the intent of leveraging the scale of Dover, enhancing profitability and ensuring that we have the best sup- pliers in the world. In 2010, we made very solid progress in weaving this initiative into the fabric of Dover. More than ever, we consider our global supply chain to be an important lever to drive productivity.
We’ve also dedicated ourselves
to lean projects across the organi- zation and finding ways to reduce overhead and waste. The importance of these continuous efforts is recog- nized uniformly across Dover. We will continue to remain intensely driven to achieve productivity, and we expect a meaningful part of our future margin expansion to be derived from these activities.
Cultivating Growth
Consistent with our proactive ap- proach toward positioning for growth with a focus on product innovation, market expansion and share gain, 2010 marked a year that saw us make tremendous strides in our mergers and acquisitions strategy with the ad- dition of six businesses.
The successful integration of acquired businesses is critical to us in increasing shareholder value. The acquisitions we made over the last
 
                                                                                                   5
  two years added 13 cents to our EPS in 2010.
As noted earlier, in December
our Knowles business announced its intent to acquire Sound Solutions,
the world’s leading manufacturer
of dynamic speakers and receivers for cell phones and other consumer electronics. When the purchase of this Austrian-based business is final- ized, it will become Dover’s largest acquisition ever and will significantly broaden our product portfolio and enable Knowles to provide their OEM customers with a total acoustics solution. Our acquisition activity has continued into 2011, as four more deals were closed in January, includ- ing Harbison-Fischer. Together, it’s expected that Harbison-Fischer and Sound Solutions will increase our total revenues by over $500 million on
a full-year basis, while substantially adding to our earnings and cash flow for years to come.
Our focus in the year ahead will be in the same areas as in 2010. We will continue to concentrate on product innovation, geographic expansion, disciplined capital allocation and leveraging our scale, all while com- mitted to superbly servicing our cus- tomers. As the worldwide economy continues to grow, the increasing demand for our products, particularly in developing regions, will position us well for continued success.
A Final Word
2010 was a very strong year for Dover, and we are expecting another solid year in 2011 and a very bright future.
Our successes would not have
been possible without the tireless efforts of our 32,000 employees.
I thank you all very much for your en- thusiasm, dedication and hard work. I also want to thank our customers and suppliers and pledge our con- tinuing support to maintaining true partnerships. In addition, I thank the Board of Directors for their guidance and continued support as we position Dover for even greater successes in the future.
Sincerely,
Robert A. Livingston
President and Chief Executive Officer February 24, 2011
