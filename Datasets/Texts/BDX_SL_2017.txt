To our shareholders, customers and associates:
In just a few short years, we have transformed BD like no other time in our 120-year history.
We have accelerated our momentum in our core solutions, we have integrated CareFusion to enhance the value we offer to our customers, and we re-engineered our functional teams to leverage our scale and operate more efficiently and effectively. This groundwork will prepare the company for the next major milestone in our strategic transformation as we acquire and integrate C. R. Bard, Inc. I could not be more proud of our associates for the hard work they have exhibited every day to fulfill our purpose of advancing the world of health while continuing to deliver solid and dependable top- and bottom-line results.
As companies grow, they often become more complex. We have been deliberate in our approach to ensure that as we continue to grow both organically and inorganically, we continually simplify how we operate to reduce complexity and stay nimble. This approach is grounded in our deep focus and understanding of the role BD has in the healthcare ecosystem: We help the people who help the patients. That includes the caregivers, the laboratory professionals, the researchers and others in healthcare settings around the world that have direct responsibility for making patients better. They
are our heroes.
We support these heroes of healthcare by providing solutions, services, education and expertise so that they can provide the best care possible and develop the next generation of diagnostics and therapies. We help the healers. And we don’t take that
responsibility lightly.
New solutions
The power of the “new” BD is seen in our
new solutions. We no longer focus on just new products, but instead we determine how we can bring a suite of products and services to solve customer challenges. Everything starts with the customer.
We are redefining medication management technologies to support hospitals and health systems to make their process safer, smarter and simpler. Through the BD HealthSightTM platform for enterprise medication management, we have introduced a new

concept in the integration of technology, analytics and expert services to optimize the medication management process and help improve efficiency, reduce waste and improve patient outcomes.
 
 About 90% of hospital inpatients receive a peripheral IV, and those IVs have a 35% to 50% failure rate.
We are also tackling IV-related complications associated with vascular access management through our ability to combine clinical practice assessments, a comprehensive portfolio of products, expert clinical training and education to help hospitals reduce unnecessary complications.
For clinical laboratories looking for better ways to diagnose, we offer a comprehensive set of tools to support disease diagnosis and treatment. This past year, we have introduced a wide variety of new ID/AST diagnostics that can identify infectious diseases and provide antimicrobial susceptibility data to enable physicians to prescribe appropriate treatments. Through BD KiestraTM lab automation solutions, we continue to automate clinical laboratories for maximum efficiency.
We are also on the front lines of helping medical researchers develop a new generation of diagnostics and therapies through our expertise in bioscience and genomics. The new BD RhapsodyTM platform is a complete system of reagents, instruments and software for targeted gene expression in
single cell analysis with the ability to detect rare molecules that researchers use to study whether the presence of these biological markers are indicative of disease. As immunotherapy research continues to

Leadership
Developing the next generation of solutions for clinicians and researchers is just the beginning of our industry leadership. As we grow into one of the top five largest medical technology companies in the world, we are also leading in areas that are critical to the future of our industry and to society at-large.
This is evident in our approach to emerging worldwide health concerns, such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR), which current trends project could cause up to 10 million

deaths annually by 2050, surpassing deaths currently caused by cancer. To combat AMR, we have mobilized our internal teams across the company’s businesses, regions and functions to integrate our unique combination of expertise and solutions across infection prevention, diagnostics and surveillance. We are also engaging with external partners around the world through the new “I’m a Resistance FighterTM” AMR campaign, where BD is building a global coalition of organizations, clinicians and patients taking actionable steps to combat AMR.

expand, the ability to isolate and characterize individual cells becomes exponentially more important, and BD is a recognized leader in cell sorting applications. This is an area where we will continue to lead.
And we continue to invest in innovation, including new technologies under development to provide more advanced “wearable” drug delivery devices and diabetes disease management applications.
The International Diabetes Federation forecasts that by 2040 over 600 million people will suffer from diabetes, costing the healthcare system greater than $1 trillion.

We also take seriously the role we play as leaders in the communities where we live and work. BD committed up to $800,000 in cash and/or product donations to be shared among our charitable partners to assist those impacted by the hurricanes, flooding and wildfires that affected the U.S. and Puerto Rico in 2017. We are humbled by the incredible perseverance and dedication our more than 600 associates in Puerto Rico demonstrated to restore our operations following Hurricane Maria, many working tirelessly to put our customers’ and patients’ needs ahead of their own.
Partnership and collaboration
Finding solutions to current and future challenges requires partnership and collaboration with other global leaders.
In 2017, the BD Helping Build Healthy CommunitiesTM partnership was selected as one of three winners for the Healthy10 Healthy Community award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation. In conjunction with
Direct Relief and the National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC), we announced the successful results of a four-year effort to improve access and quality of care
at community health centers across the U.S., and we launched a new effort focused on enhancing the medication management process.
We also remain focused on supporting priority health needs that are aligned with the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The BD 2020 Sustainability Goals are one of many ways we contribute to the SDGs through our focus on collaborating with the public and non-profit sectors, developing innovative products, expanding access to quality health services, driving environmental stewardship and empowering our associates. We are making solid progress toward our 2020 Sustainability Goals and look forward to sharing more highlights in the coming months.
The health of our planet impacts the health of humans, so we continue to take action and form partnerships to tackle environmental challenges, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain. We are taking measures to increase climate resilience
and investing in renewable energy, and I’m proud to report that 98 percent of electric power used by our operations in the U.S. is obtained from renewable sources.
Fiscal year 2017 financial results
Fiscal 2017 once again proved the strength of your investment in BD as we continued to deliver consistent results in line with our commitments. We grew revenues after accounting for divestitures, drove underlying margin expansion and delivered strong adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth— all while overcoming multiple headwinds.
In highlighting some of our key achievements in fiscal 2017, I would first point to the successful transformation of the U.S. dispensing business model. Our strategy for end-to-end medication management is resonating with customers, and we are continuing to see sales growth as customers understand the benefits of our
integrated offering.

 Second, emerging markets continue to be a key growth driver for BD. Our momentum in China and the broader emerging markets is reflected in our strong fiscal 2017 performance in both segments.
Third, we are extremely pleased with the excellent progress we continue to make with our CareFusion cost synergies. We continue to expect approximately $350 million dollars in total CareFusion cost synergies as we exit fiscal year 2018.
Finally and perhaps most exciting, we are making excellent progress in preparing for the integration of BD and Bard. We are energized by the opportunities we will have to bring more comprehensive, clinically relevant solutions to customers and patients around the globe.
Creating a new healthcare leader
Bringing together Bard and BD will create
a new healthcare leader—one of the five largest medical technology companies in the world. And while the scale of the new
BD will create an even more valuable partner for our customers, scale alone doesn’t signify strength.
The power of the two companies stems from the combined focus of each legacy organization and bringing together different, yet very complementary approaches and cultures. Historically, BD has largely focused on process improvement in healthcare. By improving clinician, laboratory scientist and researchers’ workflows, we support improved outcomes, safety and efficiency, all while reducing costs.
Bard has built its legacy by focusing on disease states and providing some of the best clinical solutions and treatments for areas such as peripheral vascular disease, urology, hernia and cancer, which complements the similar focus BD has on diabetes care. Both companies have long believed in the power of data to demonstrate how improvements in clinical outcomes reduce the cost of care.
By combining Bard’s clinical focus on disease states with BD’s focus on process improvement, we will build a world-class medical technology leader that becomes an invaluable resource for hospitals and health
systems. As healthcare providers continue to consolidate, they are looking for partners that not only bring products and solutions but the expertise around the delivery of care and the treatment of disease, from both a clinical and economical perspective. BD and Bard bring this unique combination.
Creating a new healthcare industry leader requires strong leaders as part of the management team. Last year, we promoted Tom Polen to President of BD, overseeing both the Medical and Life Sciences segments, Americas sales and R&D. He will also oversee the Interventional segment as Bard joins BD. Following the completion of the Bard transaction, Samarat (Sam) Khichi will serve as Executive Vice President and General Counsel, leading an expert Law Group for BD. Sam will join us from Bard to replace our dear friend and colleague Jeff Sherman, who passed away in 2017 after a courageous battle with cancer. We very much look forward to welcoming Sam and more than two dozen other senior leaders from Bard to our leadership team upon close.
The ability to continue to strengthen our leadership team is a testament to the company’s focus on cultivating and developing talent across BD and our commitment to inclusion and diversity. I’m very proud to say that BD—for the first time ever—earned a perfect score in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2018 Corporate Equality Index and was designated a “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality.”
Through all of this growth and change, one thing remains constant at BD—our unwavering commitment to doing what is right. We are guided by our core set of values that help ensure we don’t put company results above company principles. This is one area that we will never change.
Fiscal 2017 was another transformative year for BD, and I am truly looking forward to what lies ahead. As much as BD has been able to affect positive change in healthcare for the past 120 years, we continue to strengthen our ability and leadership in our industry. At BD, we will continue to drive forward and innovate because we know there is a patient at the end of everything we do, counting on us. Thank you for your continued investment and belief in our purpose of advancing the world of health. We have much to look forward to together.
Sincerely,
Vincent A. Forlenza
