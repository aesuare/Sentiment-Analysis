Management Letter
2009: Annus Miserabilis III 2007 marked the beginning of what is now being called The Great Recession. 2009 represented the third annual installment, and there was no let-up in its impact on Old Republic's business. Weak Housing and Finance Markets Bring Loss For the second year in a row we posted a consolidated net operating loss. The main cause for this was significant underwriting losses among the Company's mortgage guaranty and other insurance linked to the housing and financial services fields. While our general insurance segment was less affected by underwriting difficulties stemming from these areas, profit margins were pressured by a soft pricing environment and less favorable investment income growth. The following table shows how these factors contributed to a steady decline in consolidated operating earnings during the past four years, since they peaked in 2005.

2009's Economic Backdrop and Outcomes In last year's report we observed that the "business landscape was marked by extraordinary economic events that shook financial markets and most institutional participants in them. These events can fairly be traced to government easy money and social engineering policies stretching back a dozen years or more, to many years of poor lending practices for consumer borrowings, and to a large swatch of the private sector whose mindset remained focused on short-term results." iv

The history of these times will recount how the activities and the securities invented and sold by both renowned and lesser-known financial institutions undermined the public trust and many fortifications of American enterprise. Financial charlatans peddling hocus-pocus-laden securities, errant rating agencies, accounting legerdemain, and inattentive regulation all lent a complicit hand to the debacle that ensued. This reached its denouement as 2007 came to an end. In its wake, housing as a cornerstone of the American economy was broken, and trusting investors and their investment mavens were entrapped in a maelstrom of toxic financial investments. Peoples' nest eggs sustained untold losses, as did the assets of many banks and insurance companies--which were intended as bulwarks to promises of financial indemnity. Without doubt, history will tell of the many years it will take to reset the cornerstone. It also will tell of the intrusion of government regulation that followed. The events that affected the business landscape of 2008 continued to poison the wellspring of America's economy in 2009. Last year's media reports feasted attention on the after-effects of private sector and government economic assumptions and presumptions gone awry. These after-effects have lingered longer than we would have liked and led us to continue to play defense throughout 2009. Playing defense has meant protecting Old Republic's balance sheet strength to assure our full participation in new business opportunities as the economy regains its footing. We've done this in a number of ways: · · · · Investing all available funds in transparently secure and highly liquid debt securities with relatively short maturities. As a result, we have great certainty that these can be liquidated to at least recover their original cost whenever the need arises. Staying on top of all types of receivables--most notably the long-term balances due from reinsurers--to assure their ultimate collectability. Sticking with long-established estimating practices when setting claim reserves. This assures the quality of our promises of financial indemnity and the strength of the capital resources we truly have. Limiting the amount of debt we owe, to maintain a high degree of flexibility in projecting the reach of our capital resources.

Playing defense has also required a re-assessment of our decades-long commitment to insure financial interests in the housing and consumer credit sectors of the American economy. The recent underwriting losses we've sustained from mortgage guaranty and consumer credit indemnity coverages have been of catastrophic proportions never imagined. Their impact on the long-term management of Old Republic's business has required a recalibration of our capital allocation model. It is now geared to emphasize underwriting orientations less prone to financially related catastrophic exposures, and more amenable to pricing discipline and flexibility. We remain committed to mortgage guaranty and related insurance indemnities. But we intend that they be better counterbalanced against a greater amount of coverages in other insurance lines and industries served. By doing this, we assure greater intermediateterm opportunities to expand our general and title insurance business until the mortgage guaranty playing field clears up. 2009 Performance: A Mirror Image of 2008 Leaving aside a largely non-recurring benefit from certain mortgage guaranty reinsurance transactions, Old Republic's 2009 consolidated operating results tracked fairly closely with the preceding year's. General Insurance operating income for 2009 was affected mostly by lower premium volume and moderately higher claim and expense ratios. Earned premiums for the majority of insurance coverages continued to trend lower throughout the year. Premium growth has been constrained by the combination of a moderately declining rate environment for about the past three years, and by the recession. These conditions affect factors such as sales and employment levels, both of which are important elements upon which premiums are based. General insurance investment income trends benefited from greater invested asset balances. Overall claim ratios continued to trend moderately higher. Claim experience for the consumer credit indemnity (CCI) coverage, however, remained at high levels. This added approximately 7.3 percentage points to the overall 2009 claim ratio, compared with a 6.1 percentage point increase for 2008. The overall claim ratios were 76.3% in 2009 and 73.0% in 2008, compared with an average of 66.9% from 2005 to 2007. Production and general operating expenses remained under good overall control throughout the year, but still rose by 1.6 percentage points to 25.8 percent in 2009. A small reduction in total expenses lagged a larger drop in the earned premium base. As noted earlier, 2009 Mortgage Guaranty operating results benefited from non-recurring captive reinsurance premiums receipts. During the third quarter, Old Republic's Mortgage Guaranty Group entered into reinsurance commutation agreements with four lender-owned captive reinsurers. As part of the transactions, the Company received reinsurance premiums of $82.5 million to cover losses expected to occur after the commutation date. Under GAAP accounting principles, these reinsurance commutations were treated as terminations of risk transfer reinsurance arrangements rather than transactions in which the Company takes on new or additional insurance risk. Because of this, the premiums received were booked as current income rather than being deferred--and then recognized in the future periods during which the related risk will exist and expected claims will occur. v

We estimate that nearly all of these premiums will likely be absorbed by related claim costs, which negates what currently appears to be a gain. The up-front recognition of these premiums also had the effect of looking like an 8.8% increase in 2009's net premiums. Excluding this, premiums would have shown an actual 4.1% decline. As a further consequence of this GAAP premium recognition methodology, the reported 2009 loss ratio dropped from 199.6% to 176.0%, and the mortgage guaranty pretax operating loss was reduced from $562.7 million to $486.4 million. Without these premium recognition effects, quarterly claim ratios throughout 2009 averaged 199.7% versus 199.3% for 2008. Greater claim rescissions, and a moderate decline in expected claim severity during 2009, partially offset the impact of a continued uptrend in delinquent loans on claim reserve provisions. In all other regards the lower premium levels resulted mostly from our use of more selective underwriting criteria since late 2007, from an overall decline in the industry's business penetration, and from higher premium refunds related to claim rescissions. These factors were somewhat offset by relatively high persistency levels for business produced in prior years, and by a continuing decline in premiums ceded to lender-owned (captive) reinsurance companies. Production and operating expense ratios continued to reflect successful expense management. Net investment income trended up throughout 2009. This resulted from an invested asset base enhanced by positive operating cash flow. Most of last year's operating cash flow was generated primarily by income tax-related asset recoveries and funds received through reinsurance commutations. In 2009, Old Republic's Title Insurance business turned slightly profitable for the first time since 2006. Growth in premiums and fees resulted mostly from greater refinance transactions earlier in the year, and from market share gains taken from title industry dislocations and consolidations. Claim costs rose at a quicker pace, however, as the Company made modest additions to reserve provisions in consideration of recent claim emergence trends. Production and general operating expenses--while relatively lower as a percentage of premium and fees revenues-- rose in total dollars. This reflected greater personnel and other production costs related to the higher revenues attained and anticipated. In total, Old Republic's consolidated operations shed red ink for the second consecutive year out of the past 34. Despite this, we were able to pay a slightly higher dividend to our shareholders, marking the 28th straight year of cash dividend increases. The combination of adverse operating results and the cash dividend outlay in 2009 were beneficially offset, however, by substantial gains in the value of our investment portfolio. As a result, we experienced the moderate increase in the shareholders' account shown in the following table. 2009 Total Per ($ in millions) Share $ 3,740.3 $ 15.91 (157.2) 10.3 47.7 (99.1) 376.1 (160.0) 34.1 151.1 3,891.4 $ (0.67) 0.04 0.21 (0.42) 1.59 (0.68) 0.09 0.58 16.49 $ 2008 Total Per ($ in millions) Share $ 4,541.6 $ 19.71 (188.1) (2.7) (367.5) (558.3) (78.1) (155.2) (9.5) (801.2) 3,740.3 $ (0.81) (0.01) (1.59) (2.41) (0.33) (0.67) (0.39) (3.80) 15.91

Old Republic's 2009 capital account grew by 4% following an approximate 17.5% decline in 2008. Debt levels rose to $346.7 million last year from $233.0 million at year-end 2008. Most short-term debt outstanding at the end of 2008 was refinanced as part of a $316.25 million public offering of 8% convertible senior notes due in 2012. Much of this was dedicated to the capital base of our general and title insurance segments. The resulting debt-to-equity ratio of 8.9% at year-end 2009 did not have a significant effect on capitalization strength and flexibility. As noted above, Old Republic's balance sheet retained its relatively pristine state. It continued to be devoid of poor quality, illiquid, and non-transparent investment securities. Intangible assets (such as goodwill) have remained negligible in relation to both total assets and shareholders' equity. Previously established net liabilities for prior years' claims continued to develop favorably in 2009, so as not to impinge on current-year results. vi

Market Valuation of Old Republic's Stock Old Republic's common shares at year-end 2009 reflected a 15.8% drop in value from the preceding year end marking the third consecutive year of decline. However, total market return (the sum of the year-to-year percentage change in the closing price, and the cash dividend as a percentage of the prior year-end closing price) reflected a smaller decline of 10.1%. Total return on a book value basis (the sum of the annual post-tax change in shareholders' equity per share and the pre-tax dividend yield on that account) amounted to 7.9%. In both instances Old Republic's consistent cash dividend payment made a big difference. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2009, total market and total book returns have averaged 7.2% and 9.5%, respectively. While we are always disappointed by market reversals in the valuation of our common shares, we remain confident about their long-term prospects. Outlook for Our Business In our view, the near-term prospects for the American economy are not very auspicious. We are managing the Company's widely diversified insurance lines on the assumption that the economic recovery will be rather labored and take much longer to achieve than originally anticipated. Continuing difficulties in the housing, banking, and related financial services sectors--all of which tend to be most affected by consumer income and employment levels--are expected to lend a slow pace to the rebound. In addition, a possible rise in interest rates in 2010 could lengthen the road to recovery. Even in the face of this situation, Old Republic's 2010 operations should still post better results than we saw during the past two years. While our general insurance segment is not expected to have significant opportunities for top-line growth, underwriting performance should improve moderately. Our mortgage guaranty and consumer credit indemnity lines probably bore the brunt of claim incidence and severity during 2009. As 2010 progresses, these costs should begin to subside, which will reduce downward pressure on net income. Title insurance should stay on track with its 2009 profit recovery. The substantial market share gains achieved by our associates in most parts of the nation--plus our new Florida-based title insurance underwriting joint venture--should amplify both the top- and bottom-line benefits we expect from the ultimate recovery of America's housing and mortgage lending industries. The combination of our three major business segments holds the possibility of guiding Old Republic's bottom line into the profit column as 2010 progresses.
