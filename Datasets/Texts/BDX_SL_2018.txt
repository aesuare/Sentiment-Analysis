To our shareholders, customers and associates
Every day is a new opportunity to experience and make a difference in an evolving world and a dynamic healthcare industry—both undergoing unprecedented change. We welcome the potential in each new day and the opportunity that the rising sun represents. At BD, we embrace every opportunity to keep advancing the world of health, and in no other time during the 120-plus year history of the company is there more to embrace than today.
BD has always been a critical supplier to the healthcare industry with a legacy of innovation. From the first safety-engineered syringe to the first evacuated blood collection tubes, the first commercial fluorescence-activated cell sorting system, the first automated medication dispensing cabinet and the first smart infusion pump, BD has been a leader in helping clinicians be more efficient and
cost effective while helping to improve patient and healthcare worker safety. By adding C. R. Bard to the BD family, we have added transformative capabilities in the treatment of multiple chronic diseases. These new capabilities enable BD to elevate beyond a trusted innovator and supplier into a true partner of choice for
the healthcare industry. BD and Bard are uniquely positioned with unmatched breadth, depth and capabilities to be an indispensable partner to hospitals and health systems to improve both the treatment of disease for patients and the process of care for healthcare providers. New capabilities, new call points, new opportunities. A new day.
FY18 results
The combination of BD and Bard has significantly accelerated
our strategy and is already delivering measurable results. I feel incredibly proud of what our organization was able to accomplish— beginning the integration of Bard while completing the integration of CareFusion—and delivering on our commitments. We finished the year with very strong performance and momentum across our businesses and in every region. We saw this in both our legacy
BD and Bard portfolios.
For the full year, we grew revenues, expanded margins and delivered double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth. We achieved all of this while overcoming significant headwinds and making strategic business investments. We continue to have well-balanced revenue growth between the United States and internationally, with emerging markets growing by double digits in FY18, led by China. Concurrently executing on both the CareFusion and Bard acquisitions, while

 continuing to drive our strategy forward and delivering strong performance is a testament to the agility of our organization.
In FY18, we also divested several assets, including our remaining interest in the Vyaire Medical joint venture and our Advanced Bioprocessing business, and we sold select product lines necessary to achieve regulatory clearance for the Bard transaction. On the acquisition front, we announced the acquisition of TVA Medical into our BD Interventional–Peripheral Intervention business, which is a great example of our continued strategy to pursue tuck-in acquisitions to advance our category leadership in high- growth segments.
In addition, we continued our track record of significant margin expansion in FY18, which reflects the higher margin profile of Bard and disciplined cost control, operational efficiency and synergies as the “new BD.” The cumulative effect is strong underlying operating margin expansion over the past four fiscal years, which highlights our solid execution and demonstrates that our strategy is sound. We also remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends, and FY18 marked our 46th year of consecutive dividend increases.
A new day for innovating
Our new product innovation is continuing to fuel growth. From the new BD AlarisTM infusion pump and BD HealthSightTM integrated platform in our Medical segment, to new diagnostic capabilities for the BD MAXTM platform and continued expansion of our BD Horizon BrilliantTM dyes portfolio in Life Sciences, and improving blood flow through LUTONIXTM AV catheters and CoveraTM stent grafts in the Interventional segment, we saw 25 major product launches in FY18. There are even more major launches in the pipeline planned for 2019
BD PyxisTM MedStationTM ES system
that we are equally as excited about. These include a new solution to detect narcotic diversion and help curb the opioid epidemic, a new high-throughput molecular testing platform, a new lab automation solution for clinical flow cytometry, the first drug coated balloon with an indication for treatment below the knee, and the first minimally invasive endovascular fistula creation device. Not only do our associates wake up to embrace the opportunity to bring these life-changing innovations to market, but this also creates a new
day for healthcare providers, researchers and patients.
Innovation doesn’t only result in new products and solutions. We are innovating new ways to create a more sustainable company. In FY18, BD participated in the Chemical Footprint Project to provide transparency around our chemicals management strategy, and work across the value chain to minimize environmental impact and maintain resilient global operations. The team also celebrated a decade of partnerships with PEPFAR and U.S. CDC through the Labs for Life collaboration that helps address HIV/AIDS and the Global Health Security Agenda by improving diagnostic laboratory capabilities in developing countries. We were proud to continue our innovative program to support some of the most vulnerable patients in the United States by awarding five community health centers a total of $1 million in grant funding, as part of the BD Helping Build Healthy Communities program. We are also accelerating our efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance through prevention, diagnostics and surveillance, while leading a global awareness campaign to recognize the efforts of thousands of antimicrobial resistance fighters across the world. And we are tackling some of the largest challenges in healthcare, such as cybersecurity, through the BD Product Security Partnership program, which emphasizes collaboration across the industry to enhance cybersecurity of medical technology and devices.

The new BD
The new BD is led by a team who embrace each new day. We’ve strengthened our management team with exceptional leaders
from inside and outside of BD. We named new leaders for all three business segments at BD, with Alberto Mas appointed as President
of the Medical segment, Patrick Kaltenbach as President of the
Life Sciences segment and Simon Campion as President of the Interventional segment. Alberto brings a wealth of BD experience
to his role in leading our largest segment. Patrick brings decades
of experience in life sciences and has already made a significant impact on these businesses. Simon is a legacy Bard leader with expertise across the Interventional portfolio, most recently serving
as President of the Surgery business. Another legacy Bard leader, John DeFord, was named Chief Technology Officer, responsible for
all research and development activities for the company, including developing the current and future product portfolio. As part of the company’s focus on improving the customer experience, Linda Tharby was named Chief Customer Experience Officer to work across BD on initiatives to simplify the customer experience and make it easier to do business with us. Betty Larson was promoted to Chief Human Resources Officer, a position she also held at Bard, to further elevate talent strategy and leadership competencies at BD. We also promoted Tom Polen to President and Chief Operating Officer, which reflects the leadership role he’s played developing and implementing our strategy and vision over the past 18 months. I look forward to continuing to partner closely with Tom as we take BD to the next level and fulfill our potential as the partner of choice for the global healthcare industry.

A new day
While there is much to be proud of in FY18, we face each day as a new opportunity to build on our past and redefine the future of healthcare. We expect to maintain our momentum across our businesses into FY19 and continue our track record of delivering strong financial performance.
With each new day, BD is rising to accept the challenges of the complex global healthcare landscape. We are proud and inspired by our role in the healthcare ecosystem and humbled to serve
the caregivers, researchers and other healthcare professionals who serve patients all around the world. They are our motivation to embrace each day as a new opportunity to keep advancing the world of health.
Thank you for your continued investment in our company,
