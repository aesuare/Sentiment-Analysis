2011 was another challenging year. Economic
turmoil. Political upheaval. Natural disasters. The world
as we knew it has surely changed. But despite the
challenges, Kraft Foods not only survived but thrived—
as evidenced by our top-tier financial performance
and our growing reputation as one of the world’s
leading companies. We did that by staying focused
on what matters most—to our business and to our
stakeholders—and by raising the bar across the
company. Improved performance doesn’t happen by
accident. It takes hard work (lots of it) and commitment.
I’m proud to lead the team who made 2011 such
a success for our company. And I’m equally proud
that our success benefited not only our shareholders
but also our employees, their communities, those we
buy from, those we sell to and those who enjoy our
delicious products around the world.
From investing in sustainable agriculture to
eliminating waste and promoting healthy lifestyles,
we continue to evolve the way we do business to
reduce our environmental impact and enhance our
contributions to society while delivering outstanding
financial performance.
This report provides a snapshot about what we do,
why we do it and how we’re getting on. It highlights
key facts about the five areas that matter most
to society and to our business.
Building and sustaining brands people love and
trust takes dedication. And our progress and success
in 2011 prove that we can do well
and
do good at
the same time. As we look forward to launching two
new companies by the end of 2012, we will carry
that knowledge and know-how with us into these
new organizations.
