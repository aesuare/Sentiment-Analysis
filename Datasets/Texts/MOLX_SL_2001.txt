TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
IT BEGAN AS THE BEST OF YEARS. RECORD SALES. RECORD PROFITS. UNREMITTING DEMAND. BUT BY THE END OF FISCAL 2001, MOLEX WAS IN THE MIDST OF ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE DOWNTURNS IN OUR 63-YEAR HISTORY.
After scaling up production and adding capacity and shifts, we had to reverse our position quickly due to opposite conditions in the second half of the year. We performed a balancing act, timing our moves to fulfill existing orders while instituting strict expense controls companywide yet protecting future capabilities.
We ended the year June 30 with a 6.7% sales increase to $2.4 billion and a 9.9% net profit prior to a pretax charge of $43.5 million. This was especially significant since the overall connector market declined at least 2% during the period. But we’re still not out of the woods. We anticipate business will remain weak through the first half of fiscal 2002 and recover only modestly during the remainder of our year.
Make no mistake. Molex has the financial footing to withstand uncertain times. We continue to reinvest aggressively in new products and remain unen- cumbered by debt. The company today is deeply rooted in all major electronic and geographic markets. Our manufacturing facilities are among the most technologically advanced. Most importantly, we have a seasoned management team and thousands of dedicated professionals serving customers everywhere in the world.

ACHIEVING OUR GOAL IN 24 OF THE PAST 30 YEARS
Despite challenging market conditions in the latter half of 2001, Molex posted a 9.9% net profit prior to a pretax charge of $43.5 million. While we do not believe we will see margins in the lofty 12% to 15% range again, we remain convinced that—with the exception of 2002—Molex will continue to achieve a net profit of approximately 10%, a goal that allows us to reinvest in the company and finance our growth through internally- generated funds.

EXPERIENCE IS ON OUR SIDE
Knowing that the overly exuberant market would not continue indefinitely, we prepared ourselves to gear down as rapidly as possible without compromising the character of the organization and our capacity to service customers. We understand how to do this. In fact, Molex has weathered a serious recession every decade since the beginning of the company, followed by a self-induced robust recovery.
The downturn of 2001 unfolded in phases geographically, but impacted every Molex region. It hit the Far East first, then the Americas. Europe is feeling it now. The U.S. and Japan were the most severely affected.
While Molex serves an enviable mix of customers and industries, the slowdown left no segment immune. The personal computer and consumer markets weakened in November, telecommuni- cations and networking collapsed in April and May, and automotive is beginning to decline as we write this letter.
In response, we followed a structured process Molex instituted many years ago to guide us through tough periods. We started in November with an overall tightening of expenses and moved through more specific stages such as reducing the number of temporary employees by more than 2,000, cutting salaries 15% to 40% for officers and executives worldwide, lowering employee salaries across the company for fourth quarter 2001 and decreasing work weeks to four days in most factories around the world.
In June, we announced a worldwide reduction of approximately 950 full-time employees through a combination of voluntary early retirement, involuntary reductions and natural attrition. We also closed three small plants and wrote off slow-moving and excess inventory. In total, we took a pretax charge of $43.5 million to cover the costs of these actions.

While these were difficult decisions, we believe they were necessary to safeguard the long-term success of the company.
We expect the downturn to last 15 months to 18 months, taking it into our third quarter of fiscal 2002. Thus, we had to balance our need to protect profits with the need to maintain the fabric of the company and our ability to generate new products and meet our customers’ needs. To achieve this, we decided to accept after-tax profits of less than our traditional 10% during the last six months of fiscal 2001 and all of fiscal 2002.
We want to stress that we remain committed to a 10% net profit. We expect Molex will begin reaching this goal again by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.
RELENTLESSLY BUILDING FOR TOMORROW
We believe that even during tough times, many opportunities are open to us. Molex is the world’s second largest connector manufacturer, yet we have only 8% of the global marketplace. That leaves a huge amount of business out there. Today, more than ever, we are going after it and going after it aggressively.
We are not waiting for the economy to recover. We are massing energies in every area we can control. New products. We introduced 445 new product families this year–on top of the 406 we released last year–and are now experiencing the highest level of design activity in our history. Our print activity has never been stronger, as we design-in our connectors for the next generation of our customers’ products.
Short-term sales. We are using our regional sales tracking systems to identify opportunities and then we are eliminating any barriers to completing those sales. We are focusing on our core industries: telecommunications, computer, automotive, consumer electronics/appliances and industrial, with a particular push into segments that can recover more quickly such as storage, servers and PCs.
Global accounts and distribution. We are devoting even greater attention to our key global cus- tomers to ensure they receive the best possible service. At the same time, we are concentrating on our distribution channels to better serve both our small and large customers. Distribution now generates nearly 25% of our sales.
Molex.com. We are working to speed all of our customer interfaces, including our Web site. Today, we are taking advantage of every sales opportunity through Molex.com, providing customers with more online sales drawings, 3D models and technical data more quickly. Visits more than doubled in the past year.
Cost-effective production. We are continuing to move high labor manufacturing that is not automated or cannot easily be automated to lower-cost operations in China, Eastern Europe and Mexico.
Strategic alliances. We are forming an increasing number of joint ventures in such areas as backplanes, flex circuitry and fiber optics to hasten commercialization of new technologies our customers need. We also are seeding co-development initiatives, including a very promising high frequency technology business. In addition, we are continuing to examine acquisition candidates, primarily for certain technologies that in today’s market we may be able to purchase at a lower cost than developing them ourselves.
GLIMMERS OF IMPROVEMENT
We believe all four Molex regions are at the bottom or near-bottom of the business downturn.
We expect to see improvements in the same order in which we saw declines, first in the Far East,
followed by the Americas, then by Europe. Although the recovery will be slower than we obviously
would like, we believe Molex will re-emerge stronger than ever and with a greater share of the
global interconnection market. 7
The recovery will emanate from some of the same fundamentals of the electronics industry that have fueled our business for the past two decades: the demand for more information, more entertainment, more analysis, more bandwidth, transmission and distribution of more data to more people faster than ever, more sophisticated mobile products, more intelligent appliances, more digital consumer products and more vehicle telematics. The recovery also will come from the same fundamentals that have driven Molex’s growth for the past six decades: developing outstanding products and providing exceptional service to our customers.
We are not waiting for the future. We are making things happen today. Molex is now more closely sized to projected levels of business worldwide. And we have the management team to lead us to greater success. On July 1, 2001, Joe King and Martin Slark assumed new titles and broader duties, with Fred and John Krehbiel continuing as co-chairman full time.
