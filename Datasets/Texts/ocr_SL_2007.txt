                                         Fellow Shareholders:
“We are keenly focused on stabilization and growth, on reducing costs and increasing productivity, and on enhancing shareholder value.”
The year 2007 was clearly a challenging one for Omnicare, and for our entire industry, as we continued to deal with the convergence of two major factors– notably, the ongoing evolution of Medicare Part D and the burgeoning shift toward generic drugs– and the complexities this brought to our business. Nonetheless, we believe we have put in place both short- and long- term strategies to restore growth, improve profitability and enhance shareholder value. And while not so evident in our financial results in 2007, we believe we made progress during the year in the execution of these strategies and in investing in a solid foundation for long-term growth.
The Year in Review
Net sales in 2007 were $6.2 billion, as compared with the $6.5 billion reported in 2006. Net income was $114.1 million as compared with $183.6 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.94 versus $1.50. After adjusting for special items, but including a substantial incremental provision for doubtful accounts, our adjusted net income was $168.4 million versus $328.0 million in 2006, with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.39 in 2007 versus $2.68 in the prior period.
Despite the volatility in earnings, our cash flow from operations reached a record
$505.5 million in 2007 as compared with $108.5 million in 2006. The 2006 operating cash flow was impacted by two government settlements, litigation expenses and the Heartland repackaging matters, aggregating $116.7 million, partially offset by the return of a deposit of $38.3 million from one of our drug wholesalers.
Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the full- year 2007, including special items, was $455.3 million versus $600.0 million in 2006. Excluding special items (but including the incremental provision for doubtful accounts), 2007 adjusted EBITDA was $542.9 million versus $794.5 million in 2006.
During 2007, we repaid $150 million in debt, and at December 31, 2007 had $277.6 million in cash on our balance sheet. Our total debt to total capital at December 31, 2007 was 46.2%, down approximately 230 basis points from December 31, 2006.
Pharmacy Services Business
Our pharmacy services sales were $6.0 billion in 2007 as compared to the $6.3 billion in 2006. Adjusted operating profit, including the aforementioned incremental provision for doubtful accounts, for the full-year 2007 was $518.9 million versus $748.5 million in 2006. At December 31, 2007, we served long-term care facilities and other chronic care settings comprising approximately 1,392,000 beds.
Sales for the full-year 2007 in the pharmacy services business were below 2006, owing primarily to the shift from brand to generic drugs; a lower number of beds served, along with a year-over-year mix shift toward assisted living, which typically has lower

                                        penetration rates; the deconsolidation of pharmacy joint-venture sales beginning in the third quarter of 2006; and the impact of the reduction in reimbursement rates, particularly under our Medicare Part D contract with UnitedHealth Group. Partially offsetting these factors were drug price inflation and revenue growth in our hospice pharmacy and specialty pharmacy services businesses. We saw lower year-over-year operating profit in 2007 due primarily to the lower number of beds served, a higher overall level of expense for the provision for doubtful accounts and the impact of the United Part D contract, partially offset by the increased availability and use of generic drugs.
Contract Research Business
Our contract research business (CRO), including Omnicare Clinical Research and Clinimetrics, recorded, on a GAAP basis, revenues of $195.1 million as compared with $171.9 million in 2006. Reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses in 2007 and 2006 totaled $31.7 million and $25.6 million, respectively. Excluding such expenses, adjusted CRO revenues for the full- year 2007 were $163.4 million as compared with $146.2 million in 2006. Adjusted operating profit in 2007 was $13.1 million versus $7.7 million in 2006. Backlog at December 31, 2007 was $314 million.
The year 2007 was a strong year for our CRO business financially as well as a productive one operationally, with the addition of new clients, particularly among biotech, specialty and virtual pharmaceutical companies, a major expansion of capacity in India, and more recently, the opening of two new offices in Beijing and Shanghai.
Investing in Future Growth
During 2007, and actually over the past 24 months, our entire industry was impacted by the implementation and ongoing evolution of the Medicare Part D Benefit -- the most significant change in payor systems in the history of the long-term care pharmacy industry. Overlaid on this was the tremendous shift occurring from brand to generic drugs. While there are benefits here, to be sure, we were required to deal with the complexities this transition brought to our business. Reimbursement and receivables, operating costs, drug purchasing and pricing, customer service and growth were all touched in some way by these major structural changes.
Then too, our results continued to be impacted unfavorably during 2007 by unilateral reimbursement reductions and other issues under our Medicare Part D contract with UnitedHealth Group. Our litigation against UnitedHealth Group for certain antitrust and fraud claims is pending in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois and is moving forward with a trial date currently set for October 2008. We see our claims as strong and we are looking forward to pursuing our case on behalf of our shareholders and the residents we serve.
Given the challenges we faced, we are keenly focused on those strategies that we believe will produce stabilization and growth in the business, reduce costs and increase productivity, and enhance shareholder value.
During the past year, and as we enter 2008, we have dedicated efforts and resources to those strategies that we believe will promote top-line growth which, in a scale business, can

                                        “We have a substantial presence in
a market where demand will be driven by demographics, where we are providing an essential service, and where scale, we believe, is critical for success.”
be highly leveraged operationally. Our strategies have been centered on customer retention and growth, as well as broadening our services and extending our market reach.
Late in 2006, we put in place a new customer development team focused solely on customer retention and renewal. The success of this initiative, coupled with the efforts of our pharmacy operations staff, resulted in a significant improvement in our customer retention rate in 2007. Accordingly, we plan to continue investing in and developing our customer service and retention efforts in 2008.
During 2007, we enhanced sales management and re-energized our selling efforts. We invested in our salesforce – increasing its size and productivity – while enhancing incentives for our pharmacy operations designed to increase net bed growth and manage payroll to certain metrics. We are adding marketing resources to support the salesforce and to reinforce the value proposition that Omnicare brings to its customers.
During the year, we also invested in information resources that help our clients manage resident care and costs effectively, including the acquisition of the VicuraTM electronic medical records system. We believe technology differentiates Omnicare, particularly from smaller pharmacies with limited expertise and resources to provide or employ technology.
We are also continuing to focus on broadening markets, particularly in assisted living. We are dedicating resources to increase our penetration in this rapidly growing senior care market.
Our growth strategy also includes acquisitions where we can add volume, as well as leverage our existing infrastructure and drug acquisition costs to produce attractive returns. During 2007, we substantially increased the number of beds we acquired under this program versus 2006, and we continue to see a solid pipeline of acquisition opportunities. This strategy has also enabled us to broaden our growth platform by entering adjacent markets. Execution here has taken us to the rapidly growing hospice pharmacy market, specialty pharmacy services for pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and, of course, to the CRO market.
Our efforts to increase productivity led us to expand the focus of our Clinical Intervention Centers to track and respond to the myriad administrative and formulary issues presented under Medicare Part D. As a result, we have greatly improved the efficiency of how we handle the very large number of Prescription Drug Plans with varying plan designs. This has allowed us to attain a very stable and low rate of daily rejected claims, while ensuring that residents receive the medications they need.
Our focus on reducing costs and increasing productivity during the year can also be seen in our efforts to restore our full capacity in centralized drug repackaging. In 2007, we engaged Cardinal Health, Inc. to be our contract repackager for volumes previously produced at our Heartland repackaging facility. We believe this will allow us to reduce the incremental costs associated with repackaging at our local pharmacies.
We have long had highly developed purchasing initiatives related to the acquisition of drugs. Late in 2007, we launched a new strategic sourcing initiative for non-drug purchases designed to take advantage of our scale and reduce a number of key operating costs.
Lastly, during 2007, we dedicated much effort and many resources to the Omnicare Full Potential Plan, a major new program that, in many respects, presents permanent solutions to the issues we face today. The Omnicare Full Potential Plan capitalizes on our scale and scope, reduces costs, increases productivity and addresses how we may enhance customer growth.

                                        Omnicare Full Potential Plan
Omnicare, given its size, is uniquely positioned in the industry to take advantage of scale and efficiencies and to look at new, innovative ways to enhance its business model. The most far-reaching of these initiatives is the Omnicare Full Potential Plan.
The plan is organized around best practices, a hub-and-spoke operating model, and net customer growth. During 2007, we moved more heavily into the implementation phase. Best practices are ongoing across the organization, and all 31 Regional Support Centers, or hubs, are in some phase of the implementation process, with nine now providing front-end activities such as order entry, or back-end activities such as routine refills for certain of their local pharmacies. The transfer of these activities is expected to accelerate through 2008 as technology and automation are deployed.
From an automation standpoint, we have begun installing the equipment that we plan to deploy in certain geographic areas. Using commercially available technology, we will process prescriptions by filling individual unit-dose cards and applying patient-specific labels to them, on a fully automated basis, at a projected rate of 600 cards per hour. In addition, we have developed proprietary technology called Auto-Label and Verify (ALV). This technology begins with unit-dose cards and boxes of medications that have already been repackaged, and can process prescriptions comprising 960 cards or boxes per hour. Not only will automation increase our efficiency, but it will also enhance the quality and consistency of service to our customers.
Progress is being made on the regionalization of billing and on our medical records initiatives. We have also begun the rollout of our paperless document imaging technology, which creates great flexibility in the movement of data and workflow balancing.
By centralizing these support functions, our local pharmacies will be able to focus exclusively on filling time-sensitive prescriptions, delivering enhanced customer service, customer retention, and business development, all of which we believe will have a salutary effect on net customer growth.
We continue to believe the ultimate annualized
pretax savings will be approximately $100
million to $120 million upon completion of this
multi-year program. We also believe that
reductions in inventory and other working
capital should generate a total of $50 million to $100 million in incremental cash flow by the completion of the program. So, we believe the Omnicare Full Potential Program is not only attractive financially, but also sets the stage for future growth.
A Solid Foundation for Long-Term Growth
Longer term, we believe the fundamentals underpinning our business remain sound. While 2007 was a difficult year for Omnicare as we continued to address the historic changes impacting our industry, we are executing a plan, now well under way, that we believe will realign our cost structure to the current environment in which we operate and will prepare us for the future. Structural changes are not new to the healthcare industry, and Omnicare has been successful at managing through these industry pressures in the past. Adaptability, innovation and taking the long view are lessons well learned throughout the history of our

                                        company. Moreover, we believe that our franchise and scale position us uniquely within our industry for longer-term growth.
Today there are roughly 40 million Americans age 65 and older; but as the Baby Boom generation ages, that number is expected to grow to 55 million by 2020 and reach 80 million by 2040. Moreover, it is widely held that pharmaceuticals remain the safest and most cost- effective means of treating the chronic ailments of the elderly.
So, we operate in an industry strongly supported by demographic trends, as well as the disproportionately higher need of pharmaceutical care by the frail elderly. Omnicare has a substantial presence in this market, where we are providing an essential service and where scale, we believe, is critical for success both now and in the future. We have invested to develop a scale and scope that we believe will position us to remain the low-cost provider— important as demographics drive demand as well as costs.
In closing, I want to recognize all of the Omnicare board members for their counsel and guidance. I especially want to thank Edward L. Hutton, Chairman of the Board of Directors since 1981, who retired in early 2008. Mr. Hutton has been a major contributor to Omnicare for nearly 27 years. His guidance and oversight on our board have been important to the progress and development of Omnicare. His leadership has had an indelible and positive
impact on our company. In recognition of his past service to Omnicare, he has been appointed to the honorary post of
Chairman Emeritus.
Also, as part of an ongoing effort to enhance Omnicare’s board of directors, in early 2008, we welcomed two new board members. Jeffrey W. Ubben, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Investment Officer and a founder of ValueAct Capital, and James D. Shelton, Chairman of the Board of Legacy Hospital Partners, were appointed to the board. Mr. Ubben brings the perspective of a major stockholder, broad financial knowledge, and extensive experience as a director of diverse public companies, and Mr. Shelton brings extensive industry experience and entrepreneurial skills honed over a long and successful career in healthcare.
While 2007 was certainly a period of intense industry challenges, it also proved to be the right time for us to make far-ranging decisions and investments in our business to help drive Omnicare’s future growth, leadership and shareholder value creation. I also want to acknowledge the dedication of our employees who, even as we move through major change, never lose sight of the fact that the health and well-being of seniors across the nation depend on what we do every day.
Lastly, we recognize and gratefully appreciate the patience required of our shareholders during this period. Together, the board of directors and the more than 17,000 Omnicare employees remain committed to enhancing the value of your investment.
