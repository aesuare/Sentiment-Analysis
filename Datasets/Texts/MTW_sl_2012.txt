                 Letter to Shareholders—Improving our operational efficiency while further investing for growth were key priorities for Manitowoc in 2012. This focus helped us expand margins and capture greater market share in our Cranes and Foodservice businesses.
 Glen E. Tellock Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer
 Fellow Shareholders:
Five years after writing my first letter to shareholders, Manitowoc stands as a stronger, more dynamic company with our people, products, and processes aligned to achieve sustainable long-term growth. Our market-leading positions in both busi- nesses reflect the will and resilience of our people, the culture of customer-focused innovation that underscores our global brands, and a relentless effort to enhance our financial position.
Today, we are committed to unlocking the organic value embedded in our global platforms by managing Manitowoc as an integrated company. Specifically, we are:
• Leveraging our synergies in engineer-
ing, Lean manufacturing practices, and aftermarket support to accelerate new product and service initiatives;
• Building a global sourcing capability for logistics and indirect material;
• Driving steady EVA® improvement through disciplined financial manage- ment;
• Instilling a strong safety culture across both businesses; and
• Investing in global talent management and development programs that will elevate intra-company responsibility,
job satisfaction, and performance.
In essence, we are “Building Something Real” by creating real value for customers, shareholders, and employees.
Meeting Our Commitments
We began 2012 confident that both busi- nesses would continue the strong momen- tum generated at the end of 2011. While year-end results confirmed that trend, get- ting there tested our mettle. Despite weak market conditions in Europe and uncertain
   Since its introduction less than two years ago, more than 100 of Grove’s GMK6300L all-terrain cranes have been purchased by heavy construction contractors and crane rental firms around the world.

 economic prospects in China, we achieved many of our full-year expectations. We clearly demonstrated our ability to expand margins and capture market share in both Cranes and Foodservice. Specifically, in 2012 we:
• Recorded net sales of $3.93 billion, with $2.44 billion from Cranes and $1.49 billion from Foodservice;
• Posted $101.7 million, or $0.76 per share, in net earnings;
• Generated $162.3 million in cash from operations;
• Reduced debt by approximately $80 million through enhanced profitability and management of working capital;
• Funded $87.7 million in research and development; and
• Achieved positive full-year EVA in Cranes, while recording continuing EVA improve- ment in Foodservice.
These positive results further reflect our diligent efforts to manage our cost struc- ture while continuing to invest in growth.
Executing Our Priorities
Each year, we evaluate competitive dynam- ics and market expectations as we make strategic decisions to maximize long-term shareholder value. 2012 was no different. At the beginning of the year, we continued to implement four strategic operating pri- orities: optimizing market coverage to en- hance growth; incorporating Lean initiatives to improve our margins; investing in new product innovation to seize market share; and strengthening our balance sheet.
Growth As local market dynamics change, both businesses are intently focused on fine-tuning our global manufacturing foot- print to optimize coverage and product mix, boost margins, and maintain our competi-

                manufactured in China, along with the new Potain MCT 385. This economical, top- slewing tower crane features a compact mast engineered for congested urban proj- ects. Other notable achievements included the delivery of our 100th unit of Grove’s GMK6300L, a milestone reached in less than 24 months. In addition, we shipped the first units of Grove’s GMK6400, as
well as Manitowoc’s largest crawler crane, the 2,500-ton capacity Model 31000, to a crane rental customer in South Korea.
Value Creation Our consolidated results clearly indicate that our investments to drive growth, optimize our cost structure, and enhance margins are creating signifi- cant value. Our year-over-year revenue grew by 8.5%. Gross profits improved by 13%. Operating earnings increased 29%. Operating margins climbed 120 basis points to 7.2%. And cash flow from opera- tions increased more than nine-fold to $162.3 million. Our solid financial perfor- mance helped drive a 70% increase in our stock price, as nearly 800 million shares were traded over the course of 2012.
Improving the strength and flexibility of our capital structure enhances our ability to invest in long-term growth. In 2012, we reduced our debt by nearly $80 million. Since making the Enodis acquisition in 2008, we have repaid approximately $1.2 billion in debt, and have reduced our total leverage to 4.8 times at year-end. We also believe that ongoing growth investments in markets like Brazil and Mexico will be in- strumental in enhancing our future returns.
Outlook for 2013
As we look to 2013, it’s difficult to predict how political decisions, regulatory policies, and consumer confidence will impact Mani- towoc and our customers. At a time when our markets could move in either direction, we will continue to focus on improving ef- ficiencies and building our infrastructure.
Even in the face of a slower growth environ- ment, we expect revenue and earnings growth in both business segments in 2013. In Cranes, we are encouraged by recent growth in engineering and construction backlogs. We also anticipate continued

strong demand in the Americas and most emerging markets given our strategic focus and ongoing investments. And, we still have ample opportunities to boost our gross margins, which we’ll do through new product development and operational efficiency.
In Foodservice, we will continue to face low consumer confidence and uncertainty in Europe and other geographies. We expect revenue from the quick-service restau-
rant segment to grow as we deploy more resources to strengthen our ice machine, beverage dispensing, fryer, and accelerated cooking product lines and commercialize new aftermarket services. From a margin standpoint, we expect a transitional year as new investments get implemented, take root, and move us toward our longer-term expectation of high-teens margins.
Although we expect 2013 to be a modest growth environment, we firmly believe
we have the right strategies in place to leverage our market-leading positions with prudent investments, while emphasizing our commitment to increasing profitability, boosting margins, and creating greater shareholder value.
Vision
Five years ago, we established a new vision for a stronger, more resilient Manitowoc. We expanded our Foodservice platform significantly so we could move forward with two scalable businesses. Dur- ing the recent downturn, we also set the foundation within Cranes and Foodservice for sustained growth and margin improve- ment. We feel good about our market- leading business platforms, our operating structure, and our financial position. Put another way, we believe the view out the windshield is much better than the view from the rearview mirror. Going forward, we will drive long-term growth through innovation, efficiency, and crisp execu- tion. Together, we will continue “Building Something Real.”
