2014 and beyond
Q Let’s conclude with a discussion about what investors should expect from Cigna in the coming years.
A I remain confident that Cigna will continue to extend our track record for outstanding performance, into a fifth consecutive year.
We have multiple sources for growth, including the addition of new customers, and expansion of existing relationships through increased market share and increased contributions from our ancillary product offerings.
We expect to drive continued growth in our Commercial Health Care business around the world, as well as continued growth in our Global Supplemental Benefits business. We also see long-term opportunity for Medicare Advantage growth based on our positioning relative to demographics and market expansion, and we expect an improving economic environment for our Disability and Life segment.
In addition, we anticipate that benefits from our Pharmacy Benefits Management arrangement and operating expense efficiencies will contribute to our long-term growth.
We will also continue the effective deployment of our capital, and will have good capital flexibility driven by the strong free cash flows generated from our businesses.
Based on all of these factors – along with the continued execution of our “Go Deep, Go Global, Go Individual” strategy in our target markets, and in new ones where we see opportunities – Cigna expects to further improve individual health and productivity, and deliver attractive and sustainable long-term growth, all while continuing to invest back in our company. Our clear direction, strong product portfolio, financial flexibility and outstanding global team give us a solid foundation for continued success.
On behalf of my approximately 35,000 colleagues around the world, we appreciate the confidence that our shareholders have placed in our company. We look forward to growing Cigna together over the years ahead.
