DEAR SHAREHOLDER:
In 2014, we set out to grow a truly great company for our shareholders, customers and employees.
As part of that process, we set aggressive operational excellence targets for each of our businesses. We also accelerated people development at all levels of the company to ensure we have a strong bench of talent for the future. And we began the hard work to embrace new cultural behaviors — acting with urgency, being accountable, being courageous and keeping it simple
— all without ever compromising the core values that are the foundation of who we are.
DRIVING SHAREHOLDER VALUE
We are focused on pulling three key levers to drive shareholder value: portfolio, performance and capital allocation. While there is still more work to be done, I’m encouraged by the progress we made in 2014:
Portfolio
• We divested our homebuilding business to become a focused forest products company.
• We fully integrated Longview Timber into our Timberlands operations and significantly exceeded the $20 million in synergies we had targeted from that acquisition.
Performance
• We achieved our 2014 operational excellence targets and made significant progress toward the multi-year targets we set for each of our businesses.
• We improved the competitiveness of our operations by significantly reducing SG&A expenses.
• We improved earnings from our continuing operations by 22 percent (before special items) over the previous year.
Capital Allocation
• We increased our dividend by 32 percent.
• We retired more than $1.9 billion worth of shares in conjunction with the divesture of our homebuilding business.
• We authorized a new $700 million share repurchase program and completed nearly a third by year-end.
• We made strategic investments in our businesses to improve efficiency and drive down cost.
Together, these accomplishments
allowed us to deliver a total shareholder return of more than 17 percent for the year.
We also made a number
of changes to our senior management team in 2014, and I’m excited about the expertise and energy our new leaders are bringing to their teams as they take on new challenges and drive change across the company.
LOOKING AHEAD
In 2015, our priorities remain unchanged. We are relentlessly focused on achieving the operational excellence targets we’ve set for all our businesses, which will allow us to fully capitalize on improving markets. We are continuing to intentionally develop people to strengthen our bench and build tomorrow’s team. And we are finding ways to challenge and break down old cultural behaviors to transform Weyerhaeuser into a truly great company.
I couldn’t be prouder of the work our teams have done to drive change and achieve our goals. We still have a lot of work ahead of us, but I know we will be successful because of the unmatched dedication, passion and talent of Weyerhaeuser people at all levels of the company who are focused on achieving the results we all expect.
I look forward to sharing the story of our 2015 accomplishments. Thank you for your support,
Doyle R. Simons
President and Chief Executive Officer
