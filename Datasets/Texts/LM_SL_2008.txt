To our STockholderS
This was a very difficult year for the financial markets, the global economy and for Legg mason. as is well known, disruptions in the fixed income markets stemming in part from the subprime mortgage crisis, as well as record increases over the past year in the price of commodities in general and oil in particular, have had significant negative effects on many of the global markets in which we operate. our results for the fiscal year ended march 31, 2008 were disappointing, principally due to our results in the fourth quarter. our deeper and more diversified market footprint did serve us well during the fiscal year: strong results by several managers combined with reduced, but still considerable, contribu- tions by others helped offset extraordinary charges in the fourth quarter, most of which are non-cash and subject to future resolution.
amid these adverse market conditions, Legg mason achieved record revenues for the year of $4.63 billion, up 7% from a year ago. net income, including non-cash charges, for fiscal 2008 was $267.6 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, representing a decrease of 59% and 58%, respectively, from fiscal 2007. This important measure is the most disappointing and is driven by the two non-cash charges described below. cash income for the year, as adjusted,(1) totaled $877.0 million, or $6.09 per diluted share, both representing an increase of 4% from fiscal 2007. more than anything else, our diversification, global scale and disciplined investment process helped us to maintain our funda- mental strength as a firm.
Throughout the year, investors in the fixed income markets—including ourselves—have been nega- tively affected by the unprecedented large price declines and illiquidity that threatened several key sectors of those markets, including those where structured investments in mortgage-backed products have become predominant in recent years. During the fiscal year, Legg mason provided financial support to several of our sponsored money market funds, both in and outside the United states, that had indirectly invested in these mortgage-backed securities through the purchase of securities of structured investment vehicles (“siVs”), resulting in non-cash charges of $313.7 million, or $2.18 per diluted share.(2) This was done in order to protect our fund investors and the long-term interests of our stockholders. siV investments held by liquidity funds have declined from 6% to 2% of our liquidity assets under management (“aUm”), while our total liquidity aUm have increased by over $10 billion to $170 billion during the fiscal year.(3) The ultimate realized impact of this support will be seen over time; we seek to resolve these issues in more normalized markets, which are showing early signs of improvement.
our net income was also reduced by an after-tax, non-cash charge of $94.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, related to a reduction in the value of management contracts that Legg mason acquired in connection with the purchase of a Wealth management subsidiary in 2001.

 Legg mason ended the fiscal year with $950.1 billion of assets under management. our managed assets include $327.4 billion from clients domiciled outside the United states and our managers have investment teams on the ground around the world, including nearly 450 investment staff in 12 cities across the United states plus approximately 110 investment staff situated in seven cities in seven countries outside the United states—in hong Kong, London, melbourne, são paulo, singapore, Tokyo and Warsaw. additionally, Legg mason has international distribution offices located around the world including in Dubai, hong Kong, London, Luxembourg, melbourne, miami, nassau, paris, santiago, singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Warsaw and Waterloo.
among asset classes, $508.2 billion of our aUm, or 53%, was in fixed income, $271.6 billion, or 29%, was in equity and $170.3 billion, or 18%, was in liquidity. our fixed income and liquidity assets increased by $37.3 billion and $10.7 billion for the year, respectively.
Legg mason’s investment performance and asset flows this past year have been below our expectations, with certain of our equity managers, including Legg mason capital management, private capital management and clearBridge, experiencing notable decreases in assets under management. all of our managers remain committed to improving their performance records. Legg mason’s long-term perfor- mance remains strong, with 86% of our long-term mutual fund assets beating their Lipper category average for the trailing 10-year period ended may 31, 2008.
Despite the extraordinary economic and credit upheavals, several of our money managers experienced increases in managed assets, due to a combination of positive investment performance and client inflows during the year. Western asset’s managed assets increased 6% due to investment performance and positive flows, particularly during the first six months of the year. our fund-of-hedge-funds manager, permal, increased its assets under management by 28% during the year and has more than doubled its managed

This reflects both continued strong net client flows and strong performance, a testament to permal’s rigorous manager selection and disciplined risk management processes. Brandywine Global also demonstrated continued growth, increasing aUm by 15% for the fiscal year, largely due to client inflows, following a 39% increase in managed assets in the prior year.

We raised a total of $2.4 billion in capital via two transactions between January and may 2008 to further strengthen Legg mason’s balance sheet and provide additional financial flexibility.
in January 2008, Legg mason raised $1.25 billion through the sale of 2.5% convertible senior notes
to an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & co. (“KKR”). We used approximately $180 million of
the offering proceeds to repurchase from citigroup and retire shares of convertible preferred stock convertible into 2.5 million Legg mason shares. Through certain hedging transactions, we were able to increase the effective conversion price of the notes to $107.46 per share of common stock from KKR’s actual conversion rights at $88.00 per share of common stock.
in may 2008, amid continued market uncertainty and illiquidity in the credit markets, Legg mason completed a $1.15 billion offering of equity units (including an over-allotment option) while continuing to manage our exposure to securities issued by siVs.
The combination of the two capital raises, which, in our opinion, were completed on quite favorable terms, is consistent with our historical desire to maintain a strong capital base and leaves us well positioned, particularly in this period of extreme volatility in the global markets. as of our fiscal year end, our cash position totaled $2.9 billion and our stockholders’ equity was $6.6 billion. our cash position, as adjusted for the equity units offering, was $4.0 billion at march 2008, of which approxi- mately $2.5 billion is available for discretionary purposes.

Regardless of the market environment, we made continued improvements in our infrastructure, including our distribution and servicing capabilities, to support future growth and better service the open architecture world of today.
We are pleased to report that our Us distribution team established over 9,600 new financial advisor relationships, in addition to their current relationships with over 10,000 smith Barney financial advisors, across both mutual funds and separately managed accounts during the fiscal year. included in these efforts has been a restructuring of the Us distribution team into units serving both non-smith Barney and smith Barney-registered investment advisors, regional banks and brokerage firms, insurance companies and plan sponsors. We feel strongly that the new structure leaves us well positioned to encourage future growth. among the group’s accomplishments was the successful placement of Western asset’s core plus product on three major wirehouse platforms in 2007.
outside of the United states, we continued to broaden our investment diversification and on-the- ground presence through new product offerings and the introduction of existing products in new markets and/or currencies. our firmwide client base extends to over 190 countries around the world.

This has been an enormously challenging year for the industry, with significant turbulence in the financial markets and uncertainty among institutional and individual investors. These market conditions were further exacerbated by the investment performance of several of our major money managers. While it
is not unusual for the investment performance of our managers to be volatile, it is unprecedented for underperformance to occur simultaneously at several of our larger managers within both our fixed income and equity asset classes. industry-wide, long-term fixed income fund flows declined from year-ago levels, and equity funds flows declined from year-ago levels and experienced net outflows.
We believe strongly in our business model. as a pure asset manager with leading, long-term oriented managers covering almost all of the major asset classes and strategies, we are confident in our managers and realize that to outperform over the long term, there will be periods of underperformance.

Legg mason’s earnings power remains strong. our operating income increased by 2% to $1.1 billion and our revenues increased by 7%, to a record $4.6 billion, during the fiscal year. We are maintaining our financial discipline and managing for the long term. We continue to seek new sources of growth for Legg mason, particularly outside of the United states.
it has been the hallmark of our model that our managers continuously improve their processes, particularly in response to secular shifts in the markets and client behavior. We continue to work closely with our managers on all appropriate fronts to further advance this mission.
as Legg mason continues to evolve and build upon its leading position in global asset management, our focus on the long term remains the same. as i write this letter, i have high expectations for Legg mason’s future growth and global expansion, and am hopeful that recent credit-market improvements combined with our continued commitment to reduce our exposure to siVs will lead to improved financial results.
i view the following as among Legg mason’s major growth opportunities:
• Utilizing our global footprint to increase traction in our non-US institutional separate account business;
• Continuing to penetrate third-party distributors, both within the United States and globally through our wholesaling efforts;
• Expanding our institutional funds presence into insurance and other sub-advisory channels;
• Supporting managers in product development initiatives, such as expansion in our cross-border fund products; and
• Enhancing our capabilities in the European equities space.
Before closing, i want to acknowledge with sincere gratitude the significant contributions made to Legg mason by Ed o’Brien, who will be retiring from our Board of Directors this year. Ed joined our Board in 1993, and his industry knowledge and experience have been particularly helpful to Legg mason throughout the years as we transformed ourselves from a regional brokerage firm to one of the largest asset management firms in the world.
i am deeply honored to be assuming the role of president and cEo from chip mason, one of the great leaders in our industry. at Legg mason, our aim is to be one of the best asset management firms in the world. We are an investment-driven culture, and we seek to deliver investment excellence, including superior client service, to all our investors around the world.
We are focused on restoring our historically strong investment performance, despite the challenges of continued market volatility and investor uncertainty. While the near-term outlook is challenging, we believe in the long-term value of our disciplined, diversified and global firm. Thanks to the dedication and hard work of our talented employees, we enter fiscal 2009 with renewed energy, increased discipline and a commitment to improving upon last year’s results.
