    MESSAGE FROM THE CEO
 DEAR FELLOW SHAREOWNERS,
Just as we did in FY99 – when we overcame significant challenges to post record rev- enues, record earnings per share and record service levels – FedEx Corporation has closed FY00 with the strong financial results that our shareowners have come to expect.
For the 12 months ended May 31, 2000:
Continued economic strength – particularly in the high-tech and high-value-added sec- tors – led to improved growth rates in the largest segment of our business, express transportation. Our international express business continued to grow at the fastest pace, with revenues rising 18%, led by increases in Asia-Pacific and Europe. Combine our improved growth rates with our demonstrated fiscal responsibility – for example, holding capital spending to less than $2 billion – and it’s evident that, for FY00, FedEx Corporation turned challenge into opportunity.
FEDEX STRATEGIC PLAN
“Challenge” was also the operative word for an increasingly competitive environment. To turn that challenge into our competitive advantage, FedEx Corporation conducted extensive research to develop a new strategic plan, which we unveiled in January and called “Project ARISE.”
This new strategic plan is based on three sound principles:
> To leverage a significant point of competi- tive differentiation, we strengthened our superior business philosophy – to operate independently yet compete collectively. Independently, each company is free to focus on the distinct needs of its market segment, without compromising networks or service. Collectively, the entire FedEx family works together to cross-sell services and choreo- graph customer solutions.
> To extend the strength of the powerful FedEx brand name, we rebranded our major operating companies to include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, FedEx Custom Critical, FedEx Logistics and FedEx Trade Networks.
> To provide a single point of access for our customers, we reorganized and created the new FedEx Corporate Services company, which integrates customer-related activities such as sales, marketing and information technology. Through FedEx Services, our customers now have one “touch point” to connect with the full range of FedEx services – one sales rep, one toll- free customer service line, one Web site, one customer automation platform and, soon, one account number and one invoice.
It’s really very simple. Our strategic plan is good for customers, good for shareowners and good for FedEx. Customers benefit from convenient, one-stop shopping for the full range of FedEx transportation, logistics and e-commerce solutions. Shareowners benefit from tangible, strategic opportunities for continued profitable growth. And, in the
> Revenue rose 9% to $18.3 billion
> Net income increased 9% to
$688 million
> Earnings per share rose to $2.32 versus
$2.10 per diluted share a year ago, for a 10% gain.

 process, more than 200,000 employees and contractors of FedEx Corporation benefit from increased opportunities at a company widely regarded as one of America’s great places to work.
STRATEGIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES
Although our strategic initiatives will require additional spending over the next three years, we plan to mitigate those costs as we consoli- date support functions, rationalize services, and reduce administrative costs. More impor- tantly, we expect our new strategic plan to generate substantial incremental revenues and profits beginning in FY01 as we focus on the following growth opportunities:
An estimated 1.7 million businesses ship both express and ground packages, account- ing for nearly 14 million shipments every day. These “multi-mode” shippers need one con- venient, bundled solution, which is why our integrated sales force has been trained to cross-sell both FedEx Express and FedEx Ground services.
Since we consolidated our sales teams on April 1, we’ve already begun to see results. Many companies that have looked to FedEx only for reliable express transportation are now expanding to use our other services as well. In fact, our bundling strategy brought immediate – and high-profile – business as Amazon.com tapped FedEx Express and our new FedEx Home Delivery service to participate
in the largest e-commerce distribution event to date: the delivery of 250,000 Harry Potter books, with guaranteed Saturday delivery.
For our customers, our diversified portfolio strategy is the right approach, offering the right FedEx service at the right time and the right price.
Our sales integration plan also calls for more dedicated attention to small and medium- sized customers. We plan to add more than 250 account executives – most dedicated to our smaller customers – and increase prospecting for new accounts by up to 35%.
Why the special attention to small and medium-sized customers? First, these smaller accounts generate nearly half of total FedEx revenue. Second, in today’s “start-up” business environment, smaller accounts have unique needs for transportation, logis- tics, and information services. Whether it’s a new Internet-based company or a traditional brick-and-mortar firm, smaller companies are sourcing and selling worldwide, and they need a reliable business ally to help them navigate this global economy.
Since we announced our new strategic plan last January, we have already taken two decisive steps to create entirely new revenue streams that complement our core businesses.
 > Attract new business from small and medium-sized customers.
 > Generate incremental volume in our core transportation businesses by cross-selling all FedEx services.
 > Create new revenue streams.

Corp.
  
  In February, we created the new FedEx Trade Networks subsidiary to offer customs brokerage and trade facilitation solutions for our global customers. This new operating company includes customs broker Tower Group International and World Tariff, Limited, the premier source of customs duty and tax information around the globe.
In March, we launched the innovative new FedEx Home Delivery service to major metro- politan areas – and just three months later, as we issued FY00 earnings, we took advantage of our financial strength to accelerate plans for expansion. With options for delivery by appointment, at night, or on Saturdays, we believe that FedEx Home Delivery truly fits the way we live, work and shop today. It’s a perfect solution for online merchants, many of whom have learned the hard way that timely, accu- rate fulfillment of orders is a virtual necessity.
The fastest growth during FY00 continued to be the FedEx Express international busi- ness, with revenue increasing 18% year over year and gaining over 20% in the fourth quar- ter alone.
But the global economy is also the rising tide for all FedEx companies – including the expedited service of FedEx Custom Critical throughout North America and Europe and the worldwide operations of FedEx Logistics. Our newest operating company, FedEx Trade Networks, is truly a global player, providing
electronic customs clearance to speed an inter- national shipment on to its final destination.
Although ground transportation may be con- strained by geographic boundaries, FedEx Ground is uniquely positioned to take advan- tage of the surge in U.S. imports and exports as a member of the global FedEx family. In addition, its trucks can be an important source of cross-border transportation through- out the NAFTA region.
We believe that international growth must remain a high priority as manufacturing becomes even more focused on high-tech and high-value-added items that are sold globally.
As the global economy continues at its robust pace, the evolution of e-commerce is having a profound effect. While total e-commerce is projected to generate about $450 billion in sales this year, it’s the business-to-business segment that will account for over 90% of those transactions.
No matter what the ultimate destination – business or consumer – e-commerce start-ups and traditional firms alike need one seamless, integrated system for Internet-based ordering and procurement, linked to the physical transportation and logistics solutions that ensure timely order fulfillment. And FedEx is positioned right at the heart of this trend. With our unmatched global physical network and our state-of-the-art information network, FedEx helps our customers bridge the e-world with the real world.
 > Capitalize on e-commerce.
 > Expand the high-margin international business.

 > Provide meaningful supply chain solutions.
In addition to these e-commerce solutions, FedEx enables companies of all sizes – whether they do business online or through traditional means – to streamline their sup- ply chains.
The best way to explain the supply-chain concept is by example. One semiconductor company was sourcing components from 17 different countries. It took about three weeks to get the components from suppliers in those countries through the company’s North American warehouses and on to the end customers. But three weeks is a lifetime in an industry with high obsolescence rates. With a FedEx solution, the company cut its order-to-delivery time from three weeks to under five days, while increasing its ability to track goods in transit. Plus, $8 million of inventory was converted into usable product.
That’s the true power – and the bottom-line impact – of innovative transportation, logis- tics and information solutions. In today’s business environment, it’s simply the smart way to work. And that’s why we view these integrated supply chain solutions as a major growth opportunity for all FedEx companies.
FEDEX STRENGTH
As we close FY00, I am pleased to report that the state of FedEx Corporation is very strong indeed – with strong financial results, strong growth prospects and a strong business philosophy to guide our operations.
As we move forward with our corporate repositioning, we must recognize that change is nothing new for FedEx. We’ve been chang- ing since day one and, in the process, helping to change the way the world works. To stay ahead of today’s high-tech, high-speed global economy, FedEx is changing in a very positive way – becoming more collaborative, more innovative and more efficient, with an absolute focus on continued growth in earn- ings and cash flow.
Over a quarter-century ago, Federal Express invented the modern air/ground express indus- try and changed the business world dramati- cally. Now, we’re ready to reinvent ourselves – and our industry – for the 21st century.
On a final note, I would like to express my personal gratitude for three of our distin- guished Board members: Charles Manatt, who resigned in December 1999 to become U.S. ambassador to the Dominican Republic; Robert Allen, who reaches our Board retire- ment age in September 2000; and Jackson Smart, who passed away in June. We will miss their keen intelligence, quick insight and business acumen, which have helped shape FedEx Corporation.
