Dear Fellow Shareholders: We are energized. We are focused. And we are transforming this Company based on current market realities and a clear vision of our future. Interface entered 2002 with an aggressive plan of action to increase our operating efficiency and diversify our market opportunities--and with an enormous amount of determination. I'm pleased to report that we are reaching the velocity needed to complete our transformation. A look at the numbers makes it clear why we are changing the way we do business. Make no mistake: we have been hit hard by the unprecedented downturn in our industry. In response, however, we've taken steps to make our operations as lean as possible in order to squeeze every ounce of profit out of our sales. We've rationalized ten manufacturing facilities, reduced our workforce by about 30%, and implemented a Company-wide supply chain management program to pare down our cost structure. These initiatives helped us generate $39 million in free cash flow in 2002, which is not an easy thing to do in this environment. In recent years, sales in our primary market, corporate office interiors, have fallen by 35%. We dominated the corporate office market, but it has also dominated us. We realized that this kind of dependence on a single, cyclical market was unhealthy, so a key element in our plan was to diversify. The office market will come back, and we'll get our share of the profits. But when it does, Interface will already be reaping the rewards of diversification. By leveraging our existing strengths, we can use our momentum in broadloom and modular carpet and in fabrics to gain traction in new market segments. Though we have been tightening spending to help the bottom line, we haven't pulled back into our shells. We're working hard to grow the top line, developing product and service innovations to meet market-specific customer needs, and improving how we market them. Across all of our businesses, potential target segments have been carefully evaluated before resources are allocated. Each segment is sized up in terms of how big it is, how fast it's growing overall, what our current share is, how the competition stacks up, and what we can offer it, realistically. What we can offer--better than any other company in the world--is modular carpet. And modular is poised to explode across virtually every market segment and around the globe. Interface is positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity. As the acknowledged modular market leader, we have the vision, the skills and the

experience to lead the way in product development, production technologies, marketing innovations and high value customer service. We are the company that has defined the successful model of modular carpet today--random patterning, cost-efficient installation and maintenance, interactive flexibility, recycled and recyclable materials--and our research and early successes show that large market segments beyond the corporate office are ready to buy into those qualities in a large way. We're ready for them, too, with our new i2TM modular products, which were specifically designed to be installed without regard to the directional orientation of the carpet tiles and without regard to the dye lots in which the products were manufactured. These benefits make installation, maintenance and replacement of the products easier, less expensive and less wasteful. A natural progression from the unprecedented success of our initial "random design" product, Entropy®, i2 is more than just a line of new products--it's a campaign to define a differentiated category of smart and stylish modular carpet for the commercial markets. The U.S. market for carpet in schools is $300 million annually, but there is currently a very low penetration of modular products. Traditionally, the education segment has opted for six-foot roll goods, but we are attacking that tradition head-on. Our i2 line of products is ideal for sales to schools, where ease of maintenance is a primary consideration. We have gained excellent traction in this market and we're expecting double-digit sales growth in 2003. The hospitality industry, which in the U.S. also buys $300 million of carpet every year, is a natural target for our beautifully designed modular products. Currently, modular carpet has virtually no penetration in this segment. But in recent months, major hotel chains have tested our modular carpet and found that it offers a variety of advantages over other floorcoverings. For example, carpet tiles can be quickly and selectively replaced with no special tools or skills, thus resulting in no lost revenues due to off-market rooms. The trial programs have already resulted in new orders. Healthcare facilities also face serious carpet maintenance challenges that can be met with the greatest cost-effectiveness with modular products like ours. Our carpet tile has characteristics, such as the use of our Intersept® antimicrobial, staticcontrolling nylon yarns, and thermally pigmented, colorfast yarns, which make it attractive to this industry. We believe we can take a significant share of the $400 million U.S. healthcare carpet market. Of all the new segments for modular, the vast residential market is the most enticing. We believe today's consumers are ready to embrace this smart new way to cover the floor. With solid market research showing the way, we are launching modular carpet designed, packaged and promoted to introduce consumers to the unique attributes of "carpet squares." Think about it: why wouldn't at least certain applications in the home--home offices, kids' rooms, finished basements, to name a few--be better served by modular carpet than traditional broadloom carpet? Our InterfaceFLORTM design-it-yourself, do-it-yourself concept is being launched through three channels: retail stores, catalogs, and website. We believe we're hitting the $11 billion residential carpet market at the right time, with the right products--and even a modest 2% share would double our U.S. modular floorcovering business. We are also actively pursuing modular growth opportunities internationally. Much of what we do to attack new markets in the U.S. is transferable to Europe and AsiaPacific. In Germany, where modular carpet constitutes only 5% of the commercial carpet market, we created new designs and installed a new sales team to capitalize

on what we see as an opportunity to push modular toward the level that it enjoys in the U.S. In the large Japanese market, where buyers went straight from hard vinyl tile to carpet tile, skipping over broadloom, we're experiencing significant improvements in sales. In addition, we recently introduced mid-priced products in Asia under our popular Heuga® brand, and they are opening up an abundance of new opportunities for us in a very promising marketplace. Our broadloom business has struggled to keep pace in the wake of the severe corporate market decline, but we're optimistic about its future, too. While the popularity of modular carpet is accelerating, broadloom will retain a majority share of the market for years to come. We have rejuvenated our broadloom operations under the Bentley Prince Street banner, with focused management, improved operating efficiencies and the most revered brands in the commercial market. (In a 2002 Floor Focus magazine survey of top interior designers, our Bentley® and Prince Street® brands ranked highly in design, quality, performance, value and service, with Bentley taking #1 in quality.) But the major reason for optimism is diversification. For instance, we identified the government market as a prime target for broadloom sales and pursued it vigorously. We more than doubled our contract and non-contract government sales in 2002, and we're just getting started in this $200 million U.S. market. We also introduced a line of broadloom products specifically tailored to the healthcare industry, and we've maintained our dominance in the small but profitable retail stores market. Perhaps the greatest potential market for diversification for our broadloom products is the residential market, where we are making serious inroads. In 2002, we launched the Prince Street House & HomeTM Collection of broadloom carpet, which won Best New Product Line at the annual International Design Guild residential products trade show in Atlanta. Also included within the Prince Street House & Home Collection is a line of attractive area rugs. We believe the consumer is ready for better carpet. Our service business continues to provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace, because customers enjoy the single source accountability and solutions that it offers them. Moreover, we are using the customer relationships our dealer network has built to further enhance our efforts at penetrating new markets outside the corporate office sector. Our fabrics business still is operating in a challenging environment, as a large percentage of our sales are to office furniture manufacturers, whose business is off by 35% from the year 2000 peak levels. We have formed business teams tasked with opening new territories in the residential, hospitality and government markets, and we're already seeing the benefits of their efforts. For example, our sales of fabrics for window treatments such as roman shades and vertical blinds have gone from zero to $3 million over the past two years, and we expect them to approach $10 million within another two years. Although our access flooring business has suffered from the technology bust and fall off of new office construction, it's a fundamentally sound business, with market leading products, that will recover when the market turns up. However, in order to cut losses in the short term, we have decided to pursue divestiture or some other strategic solution for our access flooring operation. Interface continues to strive towards its goal of sustainability by 2020, and 2002 marked significant progress in that direction. Right now, as you read this...

Interface facilities are producing carpet with recycled materials in both the face cloth and the backing... Interface crews are taking back old carpet for recycling... and Interface operations around the world are consuming less energy than would have been thought possible just a year ago. The growing sensitivity to sustainability in many market areas--like the architect and designer community, universities and government entities--is working to our advantage. And, when you recognize that waste is actually a potential profit center, you can see that the Company's quest for sustainable manufacturing practices is "green" in more ways than one. By creating and promoting environmentally-friendly products like Entropy random modular carpet and Terratex® upholstery fabric that is 100% recycled and designed to be recyclable, the Company is seeing real and immediate benefits from our sustainability efforts--and they can only grow over the coming years. And as we learn sustainable behavior, we also learn that nature already holds the answers to questions we haven't even thought to ask. For any problem we face, any creative challenge we encounter, we have begun to look for a natural model to help shape our response. This is known as "biomimicry," and it has everything to do with why this Company is facing such a bright future. Yes, I said "bright future." In 1973, when Interface was born, the economy was in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Just two years into our existence, Interface had to confront a major market decline. The Company had to learn quickly, and the main lesson learned was how to adapt to changes and grow stronger with each change. We've had to redefine ourselves many times over the years--through economic downturns, industry movements, the bursting of the technology bubble, and the aftermath of September 11th. And we've risen to the challenge every time, re-inventing and relearning our business, and always coming out better for it. So I have no doubt that we will make it through these difficult times and--with just a little help from the marketplace--I think we'll see yet another great period for our Company. I'd like to close by acknowledging the inspiring creativity, passion and commitment of all the people here at Interface--including David Oakey, whose unparalleled design leadership is helping us carry out our vision. We've been depending on them for more than we ever have before. We haven't had to ask for more. They've just given it. As a group, they have spontaneously and enthusiastically gone above and beyond the call of duty, applying their brains and brawn to the transformation of the Company. Everything this Company is and will be, we owe to them. And my confidence in the Company--which is boundless--is really confidence in them. I look forward to the beginning of that bright future in 2003. Sincerely,

Daniel T. Hendrix President and Chief Executive Officer
