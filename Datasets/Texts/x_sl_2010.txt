 A Message from Our Chairman
Throughout 2010, United States Steel Corporation confronted the ongoing challenges posed by a global economy still recovering from a recession of historic proportions. By year’s end, our financial and operating results showed improvement over the extreme lows of 2009 but still remained below historically normal levels. While the pace of recovery remains uncertain, we are cautiously optimistic that global economic conditions will continue to improve. We are also confident that our balanced and responsible approach to managing our company, which has characterized our 110 years in business, will continue to serve U. S. Steel and its many stakeholders well as we work through this difficult period.
Safety remained our primary core value and top priority
last year, particularly as we restarted our facilities and put
our people back to work. Active engagement of our entire
workforce resulted in improved performance in one of our key
safety measurements – Global OSHA Recordable Incidence
Rate – but we were disappointed that we did not improve in
one of our other measurements, Global Days Away from Work
Incidence Rate. We are, however, continuing to make progress
in this important area, especially when our company’s injury
rate is compared with the average rates for the steel industry and manufacturing in general in the most severe category tracked by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Days Away from Work Cases Greater Than or Equal to 31 Days. Our efforts are making a difference, but we still are not where we want to be. We remain firmly committed to achieving our goal of zero incidents and injuries across our company, and we will do everything possible to turn our goal into our reality.
Another area showing marked and sustained improvement, thanks to our focused company-wide efforts, is environmental performance. Environmental stewardship is also a core value, and the work we have done – and are continuing to do – not only aids our shared environment, but also makes good business sense. Our work thus far is having a positive effect – air and water exceedances have declined 85 percent over the last four years – but we continue to pursue additional solutions that will help us achieve further improvements.

industrial process is at the heart of our business, we face significant challenges as we attempt to reduce our overall carbon footprint. A cross-functional team that includes employees from our union-represented workforce and members of our senior leadership group is developing innovative solutions and sharing industry best practices that are reducing the energy intensity per ton of steel produced as well as related CO2 emissions. We are also committed to investing in new technology that will move the steelmaking process in a more environmentally responsible direction. Three examples that demonstrate our efforts to renew our coke making infrastructure while utilizing lower-emitting technology include the recently completed SunCoke non-recovery coke battery at Granite City Works; the Carbonyx carbon alloy synthesis process facility currently under construction at Gary Works; and the new by-products recovery coke battery and quench towers being built at Mon Valley Works’ Clairton Plant.

for capital expenditures in 2011. We are investing in coke and coke substitute production capabilities to improve our company’s long-term self-sufficiency in this key steelmaking raw material. We also plan to complete blast furnace coal injection projects at our European facilities to help us reduce our purchased coke needs. In our tubular segment, we have started construction on a new quench and temper and finishing facility at our Lorain Tubular Operations that will allow us to more efficiently serve our tubular product customers’ increased focus on North American shale resources, including the nearby Marcellus Shale. We are also continuing with the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system that upon completion is expected to provide further opportunities for us to streamline, standardize and centralize business processes across our global operations. In addition, we are actively engaged with the management team and our joint venture partner, Kobe Steel, at PRO-TEC Coating Company to construct a state-of-the-art continuous annealing line to provide certain advanced and ultra high-strength steels that are being increasingly utilized by the automotive industry to meet more rigorous vehicle safety and fuel efficiency requirements.
Looking ahead, we continue to believe that the global economy is showing positive, albeit slow, signs of recovery from one of the most dramatic downturns in history. This gradual progress has led to improved conditions in some of the markets we serve, such as automotive and energy, while demand in others, including construction, remains significantly below historic levels. We will continue to operate all of our facilities at levels that are consistent with our customers’ orders while maintaining our focus on safety, efficiency and environmental stewardship. We know our customers have faced their own set of challenges related to the economy and they are working through the recovery process just like we are. We are grateful that they have continued to rely on us to provide them with the high- quality, value-added steel products they need.
Cutting-edge research reflects U. S. Steel’s ongoing commitment to provide our customers with safe, innovative, high-quality steel products.

    In Appreciation
Jeffrey M. Lipton retired from our
Board of Directors in November 2010, after four years of honorable service to our company and our shareholders. Mr. Lipton served as chairman of the Audit Committee for three years and was also a member of the Corporate Governance & Public Policy Committee. We thank Jeff for his service, support and leadership.
Executive Vice President and
Chief Operating Officer John H. Goodish retired from United States Steel Corporation in December 2010 after 40 years of distinguished service. John’s impact on our company has been significant, particularly in the areas of safety and employee development, and he played an important role in the series of acquisitions during
the last decade that have positioned our company for continued growth in North America and Central Europe. We thank John for his many years of dedicated service and insightful leadership to The Corporation.
In addition to demand uncertainties, we expect to contend with increased costs for steelmaking raw materials in North America and Europe as the global appetite for these vital manufacturing inputs follows a growth pattern that has been evident for the better part of the last decade. Our Tubular segment will also face raw materials cost pressures, but we expect to continue to benefit from the energy industry’s ongoing development of the large North American shale oil and gas reserves. The ability to tap these reserves has been made possible by technological advancements in unconventional drilling that require the types of tubular products our company is capable of manufacturing.
While uncertainties still linger in the overall economy and some of the specific markets we serve, one thing has remained clear throughout this difficult period – we are more than capable of confronting and overcoming whatever challenge is presented to us, just as we have done throughout our company’s history. Throughout our 110-year history, we have enjoyed highly profitable periods and survived industry-shaping events that claimed many of our oldest competitors and spawned new ones. Through it all, we have remained focused on our core values and relied on the dedication and talent of our worldwide workforce and the commitment and expertise of our management team to emerge a stronger, better United States Steel Corporation. We thank you for your continued support of our company.
Sincerely,
John P. Surma
Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer
