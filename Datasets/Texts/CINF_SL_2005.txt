 To Our Shareholders:
 Property Casualty Net Earned Premiums (Dollars in millions)
Your company set new records in
2005, with net income up 3.1 percent to $602 million and operating income up
7.3 percent to $562 million. This was the fourth consecutive year of higher property casualty underwriting profits. Investment income set another record, continuing our unbroken string of year-over-year increases in this measure.
Dividends from our Fifth Third Bancorp common stock added $106 million to investment income, which in total contributed $526 million to earnings before taxes. The growth rate reached 6.9 percent, and we anticipate another good year in 2006, in the same 6.5 percent to 7.0 percent range. Lower unrealized gains in our investment portfolio in 2005, due primarily to a lower year-end market value of the Fifth Third stock, led to book value of $34.88 versus $35.60 at year-end 2004. Return on equity improved to 9.8 percent from 9.4 percent, while return on equity including comprehensive income declined to
1.6 percent from 4.6 percent, also reflecting year-end market values.
The cumulative, steady efforts of our independent agents and our associates over the past several years once again showed results. Property casualty underwriting profits rose 10.8 percent, contributing
$330 million before taxes. The statutory combined ratio improved to 89.0 percent from 89.4 percent, with commercial lines continuing strong at 87.1 percent and personal lines improving more than 10 points to 94.3 percent. A.M. Best Co. estimates
the industry's 2005 combined ratio at
102 percent.
With increased competition in the current marketplace, our 2005 property casualty
statutory written premiums reached
$3.076 billion, up 2.6 percent compared with A.M. Best's estimate of 0.7 percent industry growth. Life insurance written premiums reached $205 million, up 6.6 percent. Statutory property casualty surplus, a key measure of financial strength, remained exceptionally strong at $4.194 billion.
Issues and Perspectives
Looking beyond 2005's very satisfactory numbers, certain trends suggest that 2006 will be a challenging year for our industry and for your company. We anticipate that our results may be tempered by our decisions to give up short-term gain in order to achieve long-term results. Briefly, these are the issues and our perspective:
• The property casualty insurance marketplace. Pricing on commercial lines business, the source of 71 percent of our premium revenues, is softening. It's increasingly difficult to take business away from the quality insurers that are our main competition in our agents' offices. After a few good years, there is plenty of capital and surplus to support growth, and every insurer wants to put it to work. And, while we focused on restoring personal lines profitability in 2005, other carriers refined their pricing models and began reducing their prices for good accounts. Even as we earned a full-year underwriting profit on personal lines for the first time since 1999, we began working on plans to resume personal lines growth.
As a result, we are projecting that our 2006 written premiums will be flat to slightly up, with modest growth in commercial lines offsetting a decline in personal lines.
• Expenses. Your company is investing in our future. Infrastructure improvements include major automation projects that

Property casualty net earned premiums increased 4.8 percent in 2005. On the statutory basis that facilitates industry comparisons, net written premiums rose 2.6 percent, and the company continued its track record of outpacing industry growth, estimated at 0.7 percent.

 improve service to and communication with our agencies. We are incurring expenses for new project development as well as deployment and enhancement of systems in operation. Current earnings also are charged for the previously capitalized costs of developing the systems now in operation. We've also added staff to work on these projects and to service our growing business. And in 2006, we will begin expensing options as required, with a per-share earnings impact of about 2 cents per quarter.
For both commercial lines and personal lines, lower 2006 earned premium growth could contribute to a higher expense ratio as we continue investing in our infrastructure. Overall, we expect to achieve a property casualty combined ratio in the range of 92 percent to
94 percent, which would be excellent but would not match our outstanding
89.2 percent GAAP ratio in 2005.
• Catastrophes and reinsurance. After two years of multiple hurricanes and other catastrophe losses, most observers believe we are in a period with higher potential for severe weather. Our 2005 catastrophe losses were $127 million compared with $148 million in 2004 and $97 million in 2003, including ceded and assumed reinsurance. Considering this trend,
along with our increased retention under 2006 reinsurance agreements, we believe catastrophe losses could contribute between 4.0 to 4.5 percentage points
to our 2006 combined ratio, slightly above historic levels.
We expect premium costs for all of our 2006 property casualty reinsurance agreements to be about $7 million less than 2005, without taking into account the reinstatement premiums we paid in 2005. However, reinsurance costs for some business lines are rising. Our savings primarily arose from the exceptional financial strength that allowed us to
increase
our 2006
retentions,

deductible-

amounts
that we
would pay
before our
reinsurers would cover some or all of our excess losses.
• Reserve development. Insurers set aside loss reserves from current earnings for claims that are still in the settlement process or that have not yet been reported. Generally, as time goes on, we study those reserves and adjust them if claims are coming in lower or higher than anticipated, with a corresponding benefit or charge to current earnings. In 2004 and 2005, underwriting income and combined ratios benefited from higher-than-normal favorable development of reserves.
While we anticipate a benefit again in 2006, we expect it may improve our combined ratio 2 to 3 percentage points, compared with 5.7 points in 2005 and 6.7 points in 2004.
Productivity Drives Opportunities
While these trends could pressure your company's short-term performance, we nevertheless remain very confident about the future. We have seen soft market pricing before and know that our best approach is to price every account in line with the risk we assume, continuing to target a profit in our overall insurance underwriting. We are patient, and we have proven capable of achieving industry-leading results, seeing opportunities in all market cycles.

insurers with the highest 2004 revenues. Cincinnati Financial Corporation – No. 19 – stood at the top of the list for after-tax profits per employee.
You don't have to look far to find the sources of this exceptional productivity.
Productivity Drives Progress
Your company has made strides in updating its technology. We're now placing our forms libraries and state manuals online. Several business areas have eliminated waiting and duplication of effort by centralizing their files in online document repositories, where they are simultaneously available on demand to multiple viewers. Life insurance and claims operations have used this capability to streamline their processes and reduce turnaround time. Cincinnati and our vendor were recognized with a 2005 Best Practices Award from the Association for Information and Image Management for enabling field claims representatives to remotely capture, index and submit supplemental claim materials, such as pictures and audio files, via an Internet connection.
Our commercial lines department began imaging its files in 2005. By year-end, half of its teams were using online underwriting and policy files for new business and renewals, with plans to include the other half during 2006. Our commercial lines policy quoting system now is available in all of our states, for all major product lines.
We launched a new, Web-based commercial policy processing system, e-CLASTM, late in 2005. The initial release produces Ohio Businessowners Package policies. We have plans to extend the system in 2006 to our agents in additional states and to start preparations for adding the next lines
of business, commercial auto and commercial packages. On the personal lines side, our Diamond policy processing system is live, as of early 2006, in 10 states that represent approximately 85 percent of total personal lines premium volume, and many agents are beginning to see the benefits of easier renewal processing.
People Drive Productivity
The most important source of our productivity truly is our people. Their effectiveness, above and beyond efficiency or automation, leads to profits. From our
14 investment portfolio managers responsible for our $12.657 billion of securities, to our 100 field marketing representatives who manage agency relationships and $282 million of new commercial lines business, associates across the company are highly skilled and intensely alert to opportunities to contribute to your company's success.
In 2005, underwriters continued to pay particular attention to insurance-to-value and risk transfer when renewing policies. Field claims associates, led by Vice President Charles “Bud” Stoneburner II, CPCU, as
of early 2005, responded to more than
3,300 hurricane claims and more than 200,000 claims in total, paying all that was due under the policy and doing so with a human touch.
The Relationship Mindset
Your company's professional claims representatives continue to be our best advertising program. Satisfied agents and policyholders often report that they could pay less for a policy from another carrier but refuse to give up the service of their local Cincinnati field associates.

The company historically has maintained its ratio of net written premiums to statutory surplus below the industry average. The lower the ratio, the stronger a property casualty insurer's security for policyholders and its capacity to support business growth. In 2004, the company transferred equity securities to the property casualty subsidiary. The transfer accounted for most of the reduction in the ratio for 2005 and 2004.

  Cincinnati associates connect with their customers, coming forward to meet their needs. That initiative extends to their community. In 2005, associates organized relief for tsunami and Katrina survivors, in addition to participating in regular activities such as blood drives, school partnerships and fund drives for the arts and United Way.
En masse, they put work aside for a few minutes, lining the streets in front of our headquarters offices to joyfully welcome a local battalion back safely from Iraq and to somberly salute soldiers who had sacrificed their lives.
Deeply engaged with people, Cincinnati associates have the right mindset to create the strong agency relationships cited by both A.M. Best and Fitch Ratings as they affirmed your company's financial strength ratings in 2005. The A++ from A.M. Best places your company among the top
1.6 percent of property casualty insurance groups. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services also award very strong ratings to your company.
Franchise Worth
All of these superior ratings increase our franchise value, attracting good agents by giving them a sales point to emphasize with the many insurance buyers who are willing to pay a fair price for high quality protection. In 2005, we began appointing agencies to actively market in Delaware, our 32nd state of operations. New appointments pushed us past the 1,000 mark to 1,024 agency relationships operating in 1,253 locations. Leveraging the Cincinnati claims and ratings advantages, each reporting agency location produced $2.5 million of business, on average, making us the top carrier within more than half of our agencies and one of
the top two carriers in three-quarters.
The independent agencies we select are
recognized across our industry as strong sales organizations. This year, the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers
of America gave one of our Minnesota agents its most distinguished honor and named 36 Cincinnati agencies among just 139 chosen nationally for its 2005 Best Practices Study Group. Another agency in North Carolina earned Rough Notes' Marketing Agency of the Year title. These agencies market the worth of their service, their insurance skill and local knowledge along with Cincinnati product and service advantages. What they offer is a step above the rest, positioning them to go on the offense as value players rather than compete primarily on price.
We also go on the offense by continuously improving products and tools and refining our underwriting guidelines and rate structures. During 2005, for example, we introduced a new edition of our commercial property form and our new Termsetter series of life insurance products. In 2006, we are working on improved worksite life products and enrollment software, as well as expanded eligibility and coverage updates for our Businessowners Package Policy. Your company's personal lines operations have moved into the profitable range. In 2006, we are working to improve our high policy retention and attract desirable personal lines accounts by adjusting rates, increasing our loss-free credit and incorporating insurance scores into our pricing.
Steady Over Time
Our intention remains to be a steady market participant, capable of writing most types of accounts served by local agencies.

  Consolidated Pretax Investment Income Less expenses
(Dollars in millions)
That steadiness is good for shareholders, too. In a study published in 2005, Aon Re Global listed Cincinnati Financial as the first runner- up among all commercial insurers for having the lowest earnings volatility over a two-year period. Aon's premise is that less volatile earnings will, over time, lead to increased shareholder value. It's a premise we share.
Over time, the effects of insurance pricing and economic cycles even out. At any point, we choose to look past the peaks and valleys, focusing on what it takes to assure growth and profits over the longer term. That's the basis for our total return investment program and our emphasis on common stocks, which make up 54.8 percent of our consolidated portfolio's market value.
We like stocks with steadily increasing dividends and potential for appreciation. While our financial stocks, including our largest holding in Fifth Third, are cyclical, they meet this longer-term investment objective. In late 2005, we began selling our core holding in Alltel Corporation common stock when its business model and outlook for dividend increases changed. With that sale complete early in 2006, we are investing the proceeds in line with our overall investment objectives.
Since 1996, the board of directors also has authorized investment in our own shares, including the most recent authorization of
10 million shares approved in August 2005. Your company returned $267 million to shareholders during 2005, including
$63 million through repurchases of our common stock and $204 million of cash dividends paid. Shareholders also received a 5 percent stock dividend in April. Total return to shareholders was 9.1 percent in 2005 versus 4.9 percent for the Standard &
Poor's 500 Index. For the five years ending December 31, 2005, our total return reached 40.9 percent versus 2.8 percent for the
S&P 500. Cincinnati Financial has outperformed the S&P 500 in 13 of the
past 16 years.
Over time, we seek to increase earnings
per share, book value and dividends at a rate that would allow long-term total return to our shareholders to exceed that of the Standard & Poor’s Composite 1500 Property Casualty Insurance Index. Our five-year total return matched the Index return.
NASDAQ and Mergent, Inc., introduced a new NASDAQ Dividend Achievers Index in February 2006, naming Cincinnati Financial as a founding member. It is comprised of NASDAQ-listed companies that have increased annual regular dividend payments for the last 10 or more consecutive years.
In fact, your 2006 indicated annual
dividend of $1.34 per share represents the 46th consecutive year of increase.
Your company's people are prepared to rise above any challenges that 2006 may bring and to dedicate themselves to increasing shareholder value, over time.
