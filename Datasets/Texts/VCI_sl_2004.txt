$1 billion in revenue. Much of this 14% increase in revenue was organic growth. Over the years, we have identified emerging opportunities and diversified our product portfolio. The free-standing insert (FSI) continues to be the most cost-effective mass-reach promotional vehicle. It represents one of 18 products and services we now offer our customers. We have a team in place focused solely on new product development and we continue to
think outside of the products we currently offer.
Today Valassis specializes in the growing area of home-delivered promotional media and is the only company that can deliver an integrated marketing campaign at the market, neighborhood and household-targeted level. Integrated solutions distinguish Valassis as the market leader and provide our customers with an additional promotional presence to achieve short-term sales objectives, long-term brand loyalty goals and everything in between.
To Our Shareholders:
Integrated solutions are a key component of our Vision1, and in 2004, integrated solutions helped us surpass the historic milestone of
These synergistic multi-product campaigns, coupled with the diversification of our product portfolio, expansion of our strong customer base and status as the industry’s low-cost producer have been strategic drivers
of this growth. We are excited by the greater impact these factors will have on future earnings.
Our long-term strategic plan is beginning to deliver sustainable revenue growth even though we have been experiencing competitive pricing pressure in the traditional co-op FSI industry. Our earnings per share (EPS) has declined as a direct result of this single factor. In July, we initiated a price-improvement strategy. We are encouraged by customer developments and we are cautiously optimistic about the co-op FSI pricing environment. Demand for the FSI has been strong, and overall, the FSI industry has experienced 10 consecutive quarters of mid-single- digit unit growth.
In addition to our business strategies, a number of positive macro trends2 including larger marketing budgets and the movement of marketing dollars toward home-delivered media, contributed to the increased demand for Valassis products in 2004. We
benefited from the redirection
of telemarketing dollars as a result of the National Do Not Call List and expect to reap the benefits of additional redirected dollars due to increased television fragmentation, commercial blocking products and commercial-free radio.
We also tested new media products
in 2004 in select markets in Germany, Spain and Italy, three of the five European countries where we do business. We will continue to develop new products in 2005, having crafted unique strategies for each country.
In all European markets, consumer acceptance of promotional incentives has been favorable.
Another growth opportunity lies in our direct-mail programs that are driven by frequent shopper card data. Resulting from the increased demand for these products, our 1 to 1 segment performed exceptionally well in 2004, achieving 59% growth. Following the acquisition of Catalina Marketing’s Direct Marketing Services in September 2004, Valassis is the clear leader in frequent shopper data-based direct-mail programs.
We anticipate our total 2005 revenue to be up by a mid-single-digit
3 AWARDS IN 2004:
percentage with an EPS between $1.80-$2.00. We have continued to build a strong balance sheet, and
we had $188 million in cash on our books at December 31, 2004. We expect to generate an additional $90- $100 million in free cash flow in 2005. Our Board of Directors authorized 75% of free cash flow from operations in 2005 to share repurchase, which was determined to be the best use
of cash to provide the highest return for our shareholders.
I cannot talk about our accomplishments without talking about the energetic, unwavering dedication and innovation of our 4,100 employees and their commitment to our Vision. They drive our success in the marketplace and in the workplace, making Valassis one
of the “100 Best Companies to Work For”3 on FORTUNE magazine’s prestigious list for the eighth consecutive year and earning us a place in FORTUNE’s Hall of Fame.
This innovation and creativity carries through from our employees to the diversity and uniqueness of the customized integrated marketing solutions we offer, which are integral to our Vision. As we pursue our Vision and grow our revenue beyond the $1
billion milestone, we are looking forward to building on this momentum in 2005. Valassis will continue to evolve as a leading marketing services company focused on meeting our customers’ needs and driving shareholder value.

2 MACRO TRENDS: MARKETING AND ADVERTISING DOLLARS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO SHIFT TO HOME-DELIVERED PROMOTIONAL MEDIA DUE TO: INCREASES IN TELEVISION FRAGMENTATION; THE RISE OF TELEVISION COMMERCIAL BLOCKING PRODUCTS; GROWTH IN COMMERCIAL-FREE RADIO PROGRAMMING; AND GREATER PARTICIPATION IN THE NATIONAL DO NOT CALL LIST. THESE MACRO TRENDS OBSERVED IN 2004 ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN 2005.
