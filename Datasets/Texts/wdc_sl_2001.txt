      FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
Western Digital Corporation made tremendous progress in fiscal 2001. The entire organization has been focused on ensuring that our infrastructure and business model are tuned to remain healthy during difficult times and to deliver better returns to our shareholders in periods of stronger growth. We believe we are succeeding in this effort.
Noteworthy during the year were significant changes in the infrastructure of the hard drive industry. With growth in the PC industry slower than at any time since the industry’s inception in the early 1980s, the hard drive business witnessed the privatization of industry giant Seagate Technologies, the merger of Quantum’s hard drive business with Maxtor and, more recently, the decision by Fujitsu to exit the desktop hard drive business. These developments leave three leading desktop hard drive companies – Western Digital, Seagate, and Maxtor – with approximately 75 percent of the worldwide personal hard drive business, and provide an outstanding opportunity for more rational industry dynamics in the years ahead.
Although the PC industry’s growth has been slowed by the worldwide cutback in
information technology spending, we are convinced of its viability as a high volume,
growing market, albeit at slower than earlier rates. Potential growth drivers for the EIDE
hard drive industry in the next year are plentiful, including the launch of Microsoft’s new
Windows® XP operating system, the eventual corporate desktop PC refresh cycle, less expensive microprocessor chips that drive system performance, the increasing application of EIDE drives in entry-level servers, and the
                              reality of new consumer electronics products featuring hard drives. IDC forecasts a compound annual unit growth rate of over 120 percent from 2000 to 2004 for hard drives shipped into these non-traditional applications, with shipments exceeding 35 million in 2004.
Even though financial results in fiscal 2001 failed to satisfy our longer-term goals for the company, Western Digital’s core hard drive business made great strides. Unit volume grew 19 percent and revenues eight percent as our market share climbed above 15 percent, a significant improvement from our year-earlier share.

Western Digital employs aggressive cost controls that result in an expense structure regarded as the most competitive in the hard drive industry.
This business turned profitable in the year’s second quarter and remained in the black through year-end. Gross margins more than doubled, to 10.8 percent, and full-year operations produced a massive reduction in operating losses, from $147 million to a near-breakeven $3.6 million.
On a consolidated basis, operating expenses were cut by 13 percent and our net loss was reduced by nearly one-half. Before non-recurring items, the net loss fell 72 percent.
The improving financial performance flowed to Western Digital’s balance sheet as well. Debt was cut in half, working capital increased six-fold, cash used in continuing operations was reduced by over 40 percent, and shareholders’ equity moved back into positive
territory – a swing of $117 million. Equity growth was aided by the sale, near year’s end, of an additional nine million shares of WD common stock to the clients of one of our substantial institutional shareholders, Wellington Management, for $38 million.
A company-wide focus on cost controls and efficiency advances enabled Western Digital to emerge from this period with the industry’s leanest operating expense structure, well positioned to address the emerging opportunities for cost-efficient rotating magnetic storage.
In solidifying our place among the industry leaders, we worked closely with our recording-head and media suppliers to achieve time-to-market and time-to-volume
leadership in the 7200 RPM segment of the hard drive business.

Western Digital led the industry in these drives throughout the past year as we brought to market 7200 RPM desktop hard drives with peak capacities of 60, 80 and finally 100 gigabytes. The company’s 7200 RPM drives grew to account for 58 percent of our fourth quarter revenue mix.
      Western Digital's hard drive business achieved near break-even results for 2001, an improvement of over $200 million in just two years.

        Western Digital has been awarded a multi-year contract with Microsoft to supply hard drives for its XboxTM video game system.
Western Digital continues to win accolades for quality and responsiveness from our major PC OEM customers and channel partners. Once again we were awarded the Channel Champions honor in the desktop hard drive category by Computer Reseller News magazine – the only hard drive manufacturer to be so recognized in the ten year history of these awards. We are confident that we can
continue to earn business from reseller partners and from major PC
OEMs such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Dell, Apple, NEC and
Gateway by consistently placing among the first to market and first to
volume with reliable, high-quality hard drives backed by industry-
leading service.

 Also providing confidence in our future is the company’s progress
and the industry’s promise with non-PC applications of hard drives,
clearly the most promising incremental growth opportunity for the hard
drive business since the integration of hard drives into PCs. Western
Digital has been awarded a multi-year contract with Microsoft to
supply hard drives for its XboxTM video game system, expected to debut
in the 2001 holiday season. We are also working with leaders in the
cable, satellite and set-top box industries such as Scientific-Atlanta,
DirecTV, Philips, Motorola and Sony as they design hard drive
technology into their future products. The predicted rapid spread of hard drive applications in these and other consumer electronics products means tremendous new opportunities to diversify Western Digital’s markets and revenue streams.
Western Digital is the sole independent hard drive supplier that focuses exclusively on EIDE products, so the company is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing application of EIDE drives in the entry- level server and workstation markets, previously the sole domain of
SCSI drives. We also have extensive knowledge of the enterprise storage
market. By 2004, IDC forecasts that EIDE drives sold into the
enterprise market will exceed 7.5 million, versus less than 1.2 million in
2001. Several factors are driving this trend, including price, favorable
client workload performance, emerging EIDE applications for
workstations and servers, and advances of the Serial ATA interface that
eliminate old barriers to SCSI replacement.

    Although we are excited about the growth prospects in our core business and new emerging applications for hard drives, we continue to allocate resources carefully and selectively to leverage our core competencies into new ventures. For example, Keen Personal Media offers a new tier of TV service that allows cable companies to remain engaged with their customers as the providers of a convenient, personalized television experience. The company’s system entered beta testing with two cable TV operators in July 2001, and has attracted $6.5 million in third-party investment capital.
Two other new venture investments, SageTree and Cameo Technologies, apply Western Digital’s capabilities in different ways. SageTree is providing packaged analytic applications and professional services for the supply chain intelligence market. The company, financed
in part by an investment from data warehousing leader NCR, has
bundled MicroStrategy’s business intelligence platform in its
supply chain, manufacturing and field performance suites.

Cameo Technologies has announced Universal Pictures as its first major customer for CameoCASTTM, a consumer network that delivers and manages video entertainment and promotional content locally on consumers’ personal computers. Universal is participating in a beta program with thousands of consumers in advance of a full business relationship with Cameo.
To reduce the investment risk associated with WD’s new ventures, each of these businesses is required to attain a level of revenue or outside funding within a certain period of time, or be restructured or divested.
Western Digital has redeemed over $400 million in long- term debt in the last two years.
       Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, we sold the assets of Connex, a developer of network storage devices, when our analysis indicated the need for a substantial further investment and an uncertain future for all but the biggest competitors in that market. Western Digital received $11 million in cash and gained an important new customer through an agreement to supply hard drives to the buyer of Connex, Quantum Corporation’s Snap Appliances business.

        ...we will continue to make investments in promising technologies related to our own, within the limits of prudent risk-taking.
Also, after year’s end, the assets of SANavigator were sold to McDATA Corporation for $29.8 million in cash. The sale of this successful startup in the SAN software business resulted in a healthy return on our investment. Our experience with investments in fledgling businesses like these is mixed, as can be expected. Nevertheless, we believe Western Digital has a duty to pursue new business opportunities in order to advance technology, leverage our core competencies, open new markets and create a better-balanced business model for the long term. So, we will continue to make investments in promising technologies related to our own, within the limits of prudent risk-taking.
Our outlook is favorable. In our new, cost-effective corporate headquarters we have a capable new management team. They are supported by an enthusiastic and battle-tested team of 7,800 WD employees worldwide who have rebuilt Western Digital into one of the hard
drive industry’s most respected companies.
We have proven Western Digital’s ability to weather difficult markets, intense competition and technological challenges, time after time. Our success under the most trying circumstances has given us confidence that further progress can be made in our financial performance. We are confident of Western Digital’s ability to manufacture and market highly complex products requiring great precision in production and assembly, and of the strong market position these abilities give us in the newly consolidated and restructured hard drive industry. We will explore every way Western Digital’s abilities can be employed productively and profitably.
