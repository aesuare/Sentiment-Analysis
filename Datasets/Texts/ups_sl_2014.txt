      Dear Fellow Shareowner,
History has shown that networks can act as a powerful, enabling force in politics, business and society alike. In the business world, for instance, networks can enable companies to develop products and enter markets more quickly and more efficiently than on their own. Thanks to the rapid advances in networks and analytics,
I believe we sit at the dawn of an unprecedented era of progress.
At UPS, we’ve leveraged the power of networks to help
our customers realize their goals for more than a century now. In 2014, our company delivered a record 4.6 billion packages – including 572 million packages in December, a make-or-break month
for many retailers. The management team and
I received numerous calls and emails from customers big and small who wanted to express their appreciation for the efforts of UPSers.
I am extremely proud of our team and the service they provided this year.

       Of course, the path forward will be uneven and there
will be periods where the long-term investments we make will affect our near-term results. This was true in 2014, when we invested in additional capacity to reaffirm that UPS could rise to the challenges and opportunities created by e-commerce. While we delivered on our commitment to customers, the higher operating costs dampened our profits. In 2014, our adjusted net income* increased 1.2 percent,
to $4.39 billion on a 5 percent increase in revenue, to $58.2 billion.
Last year, I was honored that the UPS board asked me to serve as the 11th chief executive officer in the history of
this great company. I began working part-time for UPS in 1974 while attending Delta State University in Cleveland, Miss. Forty years later, I sincerely believe we’ve barely scratched the surface when it comes to the potential of UPS. As the pace of change accelerates and the world shrinks even further, the unmatched reach and flexibility of the UPS network will enable our customers to navigate these changes more nimbly than their rivals. Yes, I am confident UPS is networked for growth.
The Five Key Investments for the Future:
At UPS, we’ve long taken pride in our ability to balance the needs of our customers with the needs of our shareowners. It is incumbent upon the management team to demonstrate the operational efficiencies that enable us to generate the kinds of returns investors have come to expect. We have a plan in place to do just that. At our Investor Conference in New York last November, I outlined five key initiatives to boost our customer service, our productivity and, in turn, our profitability. They include:
• Adding more capacity to our global network. UPS will make about $3 billion in capital investments during 2015 as we accelerate our hub automation and capacity expansion projects. These investments will enable UPS to build on our reputation for reliability and service, while boosting our efficiency and profitability. Last year we announced plans to invest more than $1 billion in Europe over the next five years, expanding our ground network capacity to accommodate the extraordinary growth we’ve experienced there.
• Improving efficiency through innovations like ORION, our proprietary route-optimization software. By the end of this year roughly 70 percent of our U.S. drivers will be using ORION. When fully implemented in 2017, ORION is expected to generate between $300 and $400 million in combined cost reduction and avoidance.
                                                                                4

     • Further expanding our network and capabilities in growth markets around the world. We’ve identified and are implementing strategies in 13 key emerging and growth markets that present the most opportunity. For instance, in 2015, UPS will begin expanding in 20 new markets across China, while deepening our presence in the 33 markets
we currently serve today. In addition, we’re adding more premium services and expanding our focus on key industries as well as large Asian multinational companies.
• Focusing on fast-growing industries such as healthcare and e-commerce. Since 2011, we’ve nearly doubled
our healthcare footprint, to 7 million square feet. On the e-commerce front, we continue to expand the size of our UPS Access PointTM network, and by the end of 2015 will have more than 20,000 remote locations where consumers can pick up packages on their own schedule.
• Reengineering processes and interfaces to generate greater customer satisfaction. We have more than 20 internal optimization projects underway to streamline our inside operations, control costs and improve customer service levels.
We believe these initiatives will enable us to accelerate growth and generate higher returns. In fact, we’re confident in our ability to continue to generate returns on invested capital* in excess of 25 percent.
Fortunately, we are starting from a position of relative strength. Our free cash flow1 generation remained robust in 2014 at $3.4 billion, even after making after-tax contributions of $800 million to company-sponsored pension plans, as well as $1.5 billion to transfer certain union employees to multiemployer healthcare plans.
Our robust cash flow enabled UPS to pay dividends of $2.4 billion, an increase of 8 percent per share over the prior year. Since going public, our efficient use of capital has enabled us to return $50 billion to shareowners. I expect that we’ll return more than $30 billion to shareowners over the next five years.
The good news going forward is the global economy is expected to be modestly stronger in 2015. While parts
of Europe and Asia are expecting slower growth, the U.S. economy continues to gain momentum. In addition, UPS is well-positioned to benefit from trends in global economic activity: e-commerce is expected to grow at four times the rate of global GDP, and cross-border e-commerce should grow at seven times that of the global economy.
Of course, we anticipated these trends and have invested not only in the fastest-growing economies, but in industries like healthcare and retail that should drive profitable growth for years to come. I am confident our growth initiatives, along with our capacity expansion projects and operation technology implementations, will yield benefits for shareowners.

is expected to grow at four times the rate of Gross Domestic Product.

our broad portfolio
of specialized capabilities with our vast network, there are few limits to what we can do.

Our average daily package volume grew by 6.4 percent in 2014, signifying market demand for the unique solutions UPS offers. We’ve learned when we combine our broad portfolio of specialized capabilities with our vast network, there are few limits to what we can do.
Average revenue per piece declined 1.7 percent, reflecting high demand for lightweight, lower-yielding solutions as well as changing regional trade patterns. While the management team is focused on reducing costs and improving the efficiency of our network, we also have a number of revenue initiatives in place. UPS provides high-value solutions that customers appreciate. As a result, we must ensure UPS
is compensated appropriately for the service we provide, especially during peak periods.
To improve the efficiency of our operations, we created
a team in 2014 to serve as a “control tower” and avert potential bottlenecks in our network. In 2015, the control tower will continue to focus on capacity management, but will also be used for revenue and yield growth opportunities.
On the operating side of the equation, in 2015 we will continue to bend the cost-curve lower with operational technology implementations that improve productivity and reduce overtime. We will expand U.S. hub capacity in key areas, ultimately reducing the need for temporary sorts. I am confident our team will manage costs, tighten up the plan and keep service levels high.

Our U.S. Domestic segment recorded a 5.2 percent rise in revenue, as the e-commerce revolution creates greater demand for our omni-channel solutions. By working closely with retailers, we enable them to fulfill online orders right from their stores. These solutions not only reduce the time in transit, but also help merchants capture sales that might otherwise
be lost if their distribution centers are out of stock. During the recent holiday season, the number of retailers employing a local distribution strategy increased by 50 percent and the number of stores participating rose by 30 percent.
Adjusted operating profit* declined 2 percent, to $4.5 billion, and the adjusted operating margin* fell to 12.6 percent.
The decline was the result of extreme weather-related costs in the first quarter and higher operating expenses as we invest in the UPS network to more efficiently handle the increasing demand for e-commerce.
International revenue rose 4.5 percent, bolstered by the emerging recovery in Europe. Adjusted operating profit* improved 6.1 percent over the prior year, to $1.9 billion.
Total International daily shipments climbed 6.4 percent to
2.7 million. Export products increased 7.8 percent and Domestic products were up 5.3 percent. The Europe region led the way with strong growth as the supply-chain continues to evolve and the UPS portfolio is resonating with customers in the region.
Currency-neutral shipment yields declined 1.5 percent, as shifting regional trade patterns have resulted in faster growth coming from intra-regional shipments, especially in Europe. In addition, the demand for lower-priced deferred products resulted in a drag on average shipment yield and profitability.
                                                                                                     * See reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures on page A1.

Supply Chain and Freight
The Supply Chain and Freight segment recorded a 5.1 percent increase in revenue, to $9.4 billion. Adjusted operating
profit* increased 6.5 percent to $718 million, while adjusted operating margin* expanded 10 basis points to 7.6 percent.
The Freight Forwarding business unit experienced solid improvements in Ocean Forwarding and the North American Air Freight products. However, continued excess capacity
on the major trade lanes out of Asia pressured revenue and operating profit expansion.
Meanwhile, the Distribution business unit continues to produce high-single-digit revenue growth and steady margin expansion. Enhancements to UPS healthcare capabilities around the world contributed to the improvements.
UPS Freight® continues to develop its customer base in the U.S. and saw revenue increase 5.8 percent as a result. Freight customers enjoy the convenience of working with an LTL carrier that has the strength of the UPS network behind it.
Corporate Responsibility
UPS is committed to being a good steward of the planet, and our customers are looking to us as a supply chain partner to help them meet their own sustainability goals. Since 2000, we have driven 350 million miles in our alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles. Our continued investment in these vehicles has UPS on pace to achieve its goal of
1 billion “green” miles by the end of 2017.
UPS again was recognized in 2014 for its global leadership in sustainability. UPS received a top ranking on the CDP’s Climate Disclosure Leadership Index of S&P 500 companies for the fourth year in a row. With a score of 100 out of 100, UPS ranked among the top 10 percent of companies measured and one of only 14 to receive a score of 100. UPS was also selected as a constituent of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (DJSI) for the second consecutive year, and was included on the DJSI North America Index for the 10th consecutive year.
Last June, UPS reaffirmed our commitment to the communities we serve with a pledge to complete 20 million hours of global volunteerism and community service by the end of 2020. To achieve this goal, the total volunteer hours of our employees will increase more than 12 percent and nonprofits will receive volunteer assistance valued at more than $460 million, by the end of the initiative.

The power of our network and our people give UPS a bright future.
  2015 and Beyond
We live in an era of great change, with new technologies disrupting not just many traditional business practices—
but many elements of how we work, how we shop and how we live. During the past year, we demonstrated our ability to adapt to the dramatic changes in retail and other industries. 2015 will be a year in which we not only reinvest, but reexamine, reengineer and refine our operations to ensure we are more efficient and more profitable going forward.
We anticipate that earnings per share in 2015 will increase between 6 and 12 percent. Overall, UPS expects operating profit to increase between 5 and 9 percent.
UPS is a strong company. We’re not intimidated by the pace of change, but not so secure that we’re complacent. Times change and we’re changing with them. We believe that the power of our network—and the 435,000 UPSers who run it— gives us a bright future.
