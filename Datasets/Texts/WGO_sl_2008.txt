To Our Fellow Shareholders
 Fiscal 2008 was a very significant year for Winnebago Industries as we celebrated our 50th anniversary. While extremely challenging from a market perspective, this past year allowed us to celebrate our past accomplishments while preparing for our future.  We are proud that from our humble beginBob Olson nings in 1958, we have Chairman, CEO and President built Winnebago Industries into the nation's top-selling motor home manufacturer. · According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., a retail reporting service for the motor home industry, Winnebago Industries has been the top-selling manufacturer of Class A and C motor homes each year since calendar 2001. After beginning production of the new Class B ERA earlier in Fiscal 2008, according to Statistical Surveys, we are already the 3rd best selling manufacturer in the Class B market calendar year to date through August. The 2008 Winnebago Itasca Travelers Club Grand National Rally also had an anniversary theme of "Rock'n Reunion - Celebrating 50 Years on the Road with Winnebago Industries" and featured special events including a live broadcast from the site on CBS "The Early Show." · For the past 12 years, we have earned the Recreation Vehicle Dealer Association's Quality Circle award for excellence in sales, product, management, and service/warranty/support. Winnebago Industries is the only company to have received this prestigious award all 12 years the award has been given.

We celebrated our 50th anniversary with our employees by providing them with a special anniversary jacket and with special activities at the Company's annual picnic.

Winnebago Industries' management was honored to ring the closing bell at the New York Stock Exchange on the Company's 50th anniversary on February 12, 2008.  During this historic year, we celebrated our 50th anniversary with events for our employees, our motor home owners, our dealers, our communities in which we manufacture our products and even on Wall Street.  Since we produce a discretionary product in a cyclical industry, we've certainly experienced a number of downturns throughout our 50 years in business. Unfortunately, Fiscal 2008 will be ranked among one of the toughest years we have had in the past half century. While the fiscal year started on a fairly positive note with a good first quarter; by November, we were seeing a downward trend in the motor home market that was led by volatile and rising fuel prices and low consumer confidence. According to the Conference Board, the consumer confidence index fell as low as 51.0 in June, less than half of the 105.3 recorded in June 2007. Housing devaluations and mortgage failures began to have a negative effect on the credit market as well. This was followed by tighter credit hurdles for both the wholesale and retail motor home markets. We are currently facing a tighter credit environment as more lenders exit the RV market and the surviving lenders tighten their requirements for RV loans.  Our dealer partners have been very aggressive at reducing their inventories in an effort to reduce their costs and as a result, their inventories have been decreased by over 800 units since the beginning of Fiscal 2008. Consequently, orders to the factory have slowed, causing us to reduce capacity and expenses. Further exacerbating the current market is the uncertainty associated with the presidential election.  In the past half century, we've experienced our share of industry downturns. But, more importantly, we've experienced recoveries that led us to grow into a stronger company. So, what steps are we taking to manage through this current downturn? · Production capacity decreased ­ The Charles City Manufacturing Facility (CCMF) was idled on August 1, 2008 and production of Class C motor homes was moved back to our main campus in Forest City. Since this was completed in the last month of our Fiscal 2008, most of the benefit from the idling of this facility will be seen in Fiscal 2009. Production was also reduced on the remaining motor home lines, operating primarily on 4-day work-weeks and also using alternating work schedules, operating two of the three production lines each week. Workforce reduction - We have downsized our workforce by over 1,000 employees throughout Fiscal 2008, which included employees effected by the idling of CCMF. Since the end of the fourth quarter, we have further reduced our head count by 300 employees and currently have approximately 1,930 employees, a 42 percent decrease since August 25, 2007. Total savings ­ With the efforts we have taken so far, the annual fixed cost savings we expect to realize in Fiscal 2009 are estimated to be approximately $12 million. We will continue to investigate other cost savings throughout the months ahead.

In-source ­ With lower motor home volumes, we now have the capacity to bring some component manufacturing that was previously out-sourced during high volume periods due to limited resources back inhouse into our vertically integrated systems. This lowers part costs, reduces inventories, absorbs overhead, and preserves jobs for our employees. Focus on inventory reduction ­ Due to difficult market conditions, our chassis inventories increased in Fiscal 2008. We look at the reduction of inventories as a significant opportunity in Fiscal 2009.

 With the high cost of fuel on everyone's minds this year, we are very fortunate to have excellent offerings of fuel efficient products in our product lineup. In fact, with fuel efficient offerings dating back to 1974, we have a strong history of innovation in the development of fuel efficient products. We are proud to continue that tradition as the pioneer in the creation of the Dodge Sprinter based Class C category with the launch of the highly popular Winnebago View and Itasca Navion three years ago and the more recent introductions of the Itasca Navion iQ and the Class B ERA.  When the economy recovers, I believe we will be faced with pent-up consumer demand for our motor homes as more and more Americans realize the beauty and appeal of this lifestyle and current customers come back into the market after waiting to upgrade their motor homes during this current economic downturn. We continue to develop innovative new products to meet the needs of our customers' ever changing demands and will be ready to take advantage of a growing market when the economy turns around. The fact is I believe our best opportunities are yet to come.

2009 Itasca Navion iQ · New Product Development ­ We continue to work diligently on new products and have a very exciting lineup of innovative, new 2010 products yet to be unveiled throughout the coming year.
