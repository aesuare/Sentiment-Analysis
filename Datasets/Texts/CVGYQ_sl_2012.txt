  TO OUR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS:
AS WE LOOK BACK AT 2012, WHAT QUICKLY COMES INTO FOCUS IS NOT THE PAST, BUT THE FUTURE. THE REASON FOR THIS IS SIMPLE—IT WAS A YEAR IN WHICH WE INVESTED SIGNIFICANTLY IN LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION.

Our team was exceptionally productive on the many fronts outlined in our Annual Report, and in the face of difficult commodity markets, we managed to maintain our profitability. This strong effort resulted in a handsome return for our shareholders and positioned Covanta for a sustainable and prosperous future.
Continuous improvement is part of our culture, and 2012 was no different. We stepped up our perfor- mance, renewing and solidifying our strong client relationships; continuing to advance our world-class safety, environmental and operating performance; executing on our commitment to return capital to our shareholders; and investing in numerous growth initiatives, big and small. We’re confident that with our never-ending drive to strengthen performance and proactively adapt to client needs, technological advances and market dynamics, we will continue to create value for all of our stakeholders.
Building and maintaining partnerships with our clients and communities are crucial to our success. We take great pride every time a client awards us a long-term contract or renews its relationship with us because it demonstrates confidence in our ability to deliver environmentally superior service on competitive terms. This past year, clients extended waste and energy contracts totaling $2.5 billion
in revenue, with an average term of 12 years. By securing two million annual tons of waste and 750,000 megawatt-hours of annual electricity sales, we further solidified our base operations. We’ll continue to vigorously pursue contracts to build upon our long-standing tradition of developing sustainable solu- tions for our clients, and extend our predictable cash flow well into the future.
In terms of operating performance, 2012 was an outstanding year. We achieved record Energy-from- Waste boiler availability of over 92% and we improved our metal-recycling efforts, resulting in the recovery and recycling of 432,000 tons of metal. We also marked the five-year anniversary of our Clean World Initiative, which has had a remarkable impact on our business. One of the most gratifying accomplishments of this program has been our success in improving our already impressive emissions performance. We now consistently operate at less than 25% of the levels allowed under the U.S. Clean Air Act. This bodes well for the future as we continue to drive the leading edge of industry performance.
During the past year we also continued to demonstrate our disciplined approach to capital allocation. We doubled our annual dividend to $0.60 per share and repurchased nearly $90 million of stock, reducing our actual share count to 132 million by year end—a reduction of almost 17% since we started the buyback program less than three years ago. We also completed several smart financial transactions, including refinancing nearly $2 billion in debt to extend maturities, enhance flexibility and lock in attractive interest rates. In addition, we positioned ourselves well for future growth on several other fronts:
• We added system-wide capacity with the completion of the Honolulu facility expansion, and made great progress on construction of the Durham York facility;
• We began a program of significant investment in new metal recovery systems that, in the coming years, will yield meaningful improvement in the quantity and quality of metal that we recover and sell;
• We formed a joint venture with TARTECH eco industries AG to acquire the exclusive rights in North America to an exciting technology which will be used to recover metal at ash monofills;
• We enhanced our special waste services which led to significant special waste revenue growth, setting the stage for continued strong growth for years to come;
• We worked to maintain a competitive advantage with technology, investing in our innovative CLEERGAS® gasification technology, as well as in LNTM and VLNTM, our technologies to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions;
• Finally, we continued to make progress on our project development opportunities which hold meaningful potential, but depend largely on decision-making within our prospective municipal government partners.
The future—2013 and beyond—holds much promise for Covanta. There will be challenges in the years ahead, some known and some not yet foreseen, but we have a proven ability to mitigate, adapt and find hidden opportunities. Our experienced, innovative and opportunistic team will maintain a steadfast commitment to provide excellent service for our clients and generate strong returns for our shareholders. And to this commitment we dedicate our results.
