Fluor Corporation 2009 Annual Report

1

Dear Valued Shareholders
Despite the significant challenges presented by the global financial crisis, I am proud to report that Fluor achieved its second-best financial performance in the Company's nearly 100-year history. This was made possible by leveraging our competitive strengths and dedication to superior execution across the full spectrum of the markets that we serve. Net earnings of $685 million, or $3.75 per share, were just below 2008's record year. Revenue was $22.0 billion, a decrease of just 1.5 percent. While changing market conditions led to some project scope reductions and cancellations during the year, Fluor begins 2010 with a healthy $27 billion backlog, excellent client relationships and one of the industry's strongest balance sheets. Diversification, Flexibility and Fiscal Discipline Our performance is a testament to our geographic and industry diversity, which has long been a central strategy for reducing the cyclical impact of individual markets and enhancing consistency in long-term performance. Having advanced global information systems, standardized processes and a dispersed project execution model also supports our ability to respond to changing market conditions and meet client needs. To help mitigate the effects of the challenging economic environment and provide a solid foundation for renewed growth, we implemented an aggressive cost-savings program early in the year. This better positions us from a cost perspective for what we believe will be an extremely competitive marketplace in 2010. Additionally, Fluor stakeholders benefit from the Company's conservative financial strategies and fiscal discipline. We maintain the highest credit rating of any publicly traded company in our industry. Our strong balance sheet allows us to continue to pay quarterly dividends, make periodic share repurchases, invest in critical employee training and launch new strategic initiatives. At year end, we had minimal debt and $2.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. Business Performance Our market opportunities continue to be broad-based. While Fluor won new awards of $18.5 billion, this was down 26 percent from record bookings in 2008. This decline is a direct reflection of the reduction in global investment last year. However, we are well positioned to benefit when capital spending and the overall economy recover. In our Oil & Gas segment, our focus is on international markets. The Upstream side of this business provides the greatest opportunities for large projects where we can bring our extensive program management capabilities to bear. During 2009, our team successfully completed the $1.5 billion RasGas Common Offplot project in Qatar. We also continued to strengthen our Fluor Offshore Solutions unit in 2009, by forming new alliances and building client relationships focused on projects in the Middle East, North Africa, China and Australia.

Fluor Corporation 2009 Annual Report

On the Downstream side, Fluor is performing well on a number of important U.S. refinery projects, including the $3.4 billion Whiting Refinery Modernization project for BP America and multi-billion-dollar refinery expansion work for Marathon Oil in Detroit, Michigan, and Garyville, Louisiana. We also see future downstream opportunities abroad, primarily in Europe, Mexico, the Middle East and Asia, while future petrochemical prospects are focused in China and the Middle East. Major new oil and gas awards in 2009 included an onshore processing facility in Russia, two refinery projects in Mexico, a gas storage project in The Netherlands, and incremental refining, petrochemicals and oil and gas production work. Fluor secured the only material new oil sands project to be awarded to any company during 2009, a $1.8 billion contract for Imperial Oil's Kearl project in Canada. In our Industrial & Infrastructure segment, new awards were again wide ranging. Our Mining business is benefiting from strong demand for copper, gold and iron ore projects. We are currently executing a number of projects ranging from iron ore in Australia, copper and gold mining in South America to nickel in Canada and diamonds in Africa. With a significant volume of Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) activities, 2010 should be another strong year for our Mining team. Our Infrastructure unit had a solid 2009 with significant progress on several large projects. New awards included a highway expansion project in Utah and additional awards for the I-495 project in Virginia. The team's work on the world's largest wind farm off the U.K. coast positioned Fluor to win exclusive rights to develop other large wind farm projects off the coast of Scotland. A source of tremendous pride is Fluor's ongoing work on the world's largest self-anchored suspension bridge in the San Francisco-Oakland area of California. Existing and proposed transportation initiatives in North America and Europe should continue to generate new opportunities for our team. Fluor's Government group performed very well in 2009, as we served various federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense and Energy. During the year, we recorded more than $2.3 billion in new awards, including the U.S. Army's LOGCAP IV Task Order 5 to support the military at over 70 operating bases in northern

Afghanistan. In addition to our long-term contract, we benefited from the U.S. Recovery Act program, with additional funding for our operations, management and remediation work under way at the Department of Energy's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Fluor's Power segment had its best year ever in 2009, posting record profits, and holds great potential for future growth. We are a leader in providing power-generation, carbon-capture and plant-betterment technologies to help customers deliver on key strategic and environmental initiatives. Last year, the Company was honored with the Project Management Institute's distinguished Project of the Year Award for its work on Newmont Mining's TS power plant in Nevada. In 2010, we will complete Luminant's new 1600-megawatt Oak Grove power plant in Texas. Key new power awards included an integrated gasification combined cycle fire rebuild project in Italy and FEED work for Tenaska's proposed supercritical 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant in Texas, which, if approved, will be the first coal plant with advanced carbon capture and sequestration. As the United States moves toward a nuclear renaissance, we continue our support of Toshiba on NRG's South Texas Project, which will include two new nuclear reactors should the project proceed. As part of our Power segment, we established a Renewables business line to consolidate our expertise in the growing sectors of solar, wind and biomass. Prospect activity in the United States and Europe is robust, and during the year, we were selected by eSolar to provide engineering for its 46 megawatt concentrating solar power plant. Our Global Services segment continues to be effective at renewing existing long-term contracts, although it has seen reductions in small capital work and deferrals in scheduled maintenance as clients trimmed discretionary spending. Our team maintains a presence on nearly 300 sites, and we remain optimistic that normal spending levels will return in late 2010. Leadership During 2009, we made several organizational changes to better position and utilize executive talent where it can most effectively address client needs and execution excellence. I have great confidence in David Seaton, a

25-year Fluor veteran, who was appointed Chief Operating Officer to manage day-to day operations, while I concentrate on client relationships and growth strategies. We also bid farewell to two members of our Board of Directors. Vilma Martinez retired to become the new U.S. Ambassador to Argentina, while Dr. Peter Watson departed to focus on his advisory business. We are grateful to both for their strategic counsel and many contributions. We welcomed Nader Sultan, a senior partner of F+N Consultancy, to the Board last year. He brings great insight and a valuable global perspective gained from 33 years as a senior executive in the Kuwait oil industry. Looking Ahead As we enter 2010, we are confident that we have the right strategies, diversification, financial structure, organizational focus and leadership to capitalize on available opportunities and position Fluor for long term growth. Our optimism is supported by the increasing volume of FEED activities, positive ongoing client discussions and improving global economic conditions, which all point toward new capital investments over the next several years. Our actions in 2009 to focus on cost management and to invest in areas of strategic growth should position us to take advantage of emerging opportunities. We will continue to pursue projects on a selective basis where we believe we have a competitive advantage and an effective strategy to win that includes adequate risk protection. Over the long term, we will continue to work to provide superior solutions to our clients, drive innovation and leverage our strengths, track record

and brand. We expect that the substantial earnings power of our existing backlog, combined with our expectations for new business, will allow us to deliver strong earnings in 2010. Our business and financial performance is the result of extraordinary commitment and capability at every level of our Company. I am immensely grateful to Fluor's many employees for their dedication to the values of safety, integrity, teamwork and excellence that are the hallmarks of our great Company. Finally, our successes in 2009 would not have been possible without our loyal clients and shareholders. We deeply appreciate your continued confidence in our Company and its future. The insight gained from our almost 100 years in business gives us tremendous strength that I believe is unmatched in the industry. I continue to be encouraged by Fluor's ability to deliver, and I remain confident in Fluor's industry leadership.
