LKQÕS STRENGTH EVIDENT IN WEAK ECONOMY
We are pleased to announce that LKQ achieved record results in 2009. We achieved revenue of $2 billion, representing a 7.3% increase over 2008. Despite a period of weak economic growth in the United States, we realized solid organic sales increases as the use of alternative automotive parts continued to expand. Taking advantage of our solid financial condition, we continued to invest in our businesses and grow inventory while others may have been
contracting their inventory levels. In so doing, we capitalized on our nationwide distribution network to meet the increased demand from our customers.
As 2009 progressed, some of the challenges facing our industry seemed to diminish and reach a level of stability. By year-end, miles driven was trending upward and consumer confidence had improved. More importantly, auto insurance companies continued their efforts to control claims costs through increased use of aftermarket, recycled and refurbished auto parts as an alternative to more costly new OEM parts.

INTEGRATED OPERATIONS
IMPROVE CROSS-SELLING OPPORTUNITIES
LKQÕs financial results reflect our continued progress towards integrating our wholesale recycling operations with the aftermarket and refurbishing businesses we acquired in late 2007 with the Keystone transaction. We started the year with a redesigned regional organization focused around our wholesale product lines. The new structure provided clearer direction and goals for the operating units, and led to a heightened focus on the needs of our customers. Looking forward, we are pursuing additional opportunities to integrate our wholesale product lines through shared distribution networks and improved cross-selling to our customers.
BREADTH AND DEPTH OF INVENTORY OFFER TRUE ALTERNATIVES
With competitive pressures holding down auto insurance policy rates, insurers are actively searching for ways to contain repair costs. The breadth and depth of our inventory, maintained throughout our nationwide network of warehouses, provide our customers with true alternatives to the use of new OEM parts. Recycled and refurbished products are able to fulfill some of the demand for alternative parts, but their availability is constrained by the supply of salvage vehicles and core parts. We believe our aftermarket sales will realize the greatest benefit from these demand trends. Our extensive aftermarket product lines, including Platinum Plus, CAPA and Value Line parts, provide a broad set of options for our customers.

 PROVIDING WAYS TO CONTAIN
REPAIR COSTS
The collision and mechanical repair industries are looking for ways to control repair costs without compromising quality. We continue to develop and refine parts supply programs that make it easier for our customers to use alternative parts for professional repairs. To help our customers accomplish their objectives, we have developed programs to offer a broad array of superior aftermarket, recycled and refurbished parts that provide alternatives to new OEMreplacementparts. Theprogramsoftenincorporatesystems and operational support to improve repair shop participation rates. We believe that our parts supply programs differentiate our products and customer service from the competition.

   SELF-SERVICE RECYCLING SHOWS STRONG RECOVERY
Our self-service recycling operations rebounded nicely from the depressed commodity markets we saw in the fourth quarter of 2008. As the year progressed and the supply of lower priced cars improved, our self-service revenue grew. We closed the 2009 year with better yields driven by higher commodity prices and a strong focus on parts sales.
   TRUCK OPERATIONS PICK UP SPEED
We were especially encouraged by the performance of our truck operations in light of the significant downturn throughout the freight transportation industry in 2009. While revenue from the sale of used parts and trucks was soft, margins remained at profitable levels. Disruptions in the global economy and commodity markets had a severe impact on demand from export buyers of heavy-duty trucks; however, we continue to see demand for secure truck disposals. Moving forward, we will seek improved export sales while developing a stronger domestic marketing effort and a broader presence throughout the United States.
STRATEGIC GROWTH THROUGH KEY ACQUISITIONS
We completed a number of strategic acquisitions during the year. Our largest purchase was Greenleaf Auto Recyclers, a company with 17 wholesale recycling operations and the second largest provider of recycled auto parts behind LKQ. We also purchased an aftermarket business with a total of four locations in Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania in order to enhance our aftermarket sales in those markets. Continuing our plan to build a network of heavy-duty truck sales locations, we purchased truck operations in Tampa, Florida; Easton, Maryland; and Fresno, California. These acquisitions and others being planned represent a combined effort to expand our footprint to new geographic areas, along with enhancing our presence in existing markets.

RECOMMITTING OURSELVES EACH DAY
Our success is made possible by the more than 10,000 dedicated employees of LKQ who recommit themselves every day to meeting the needs of our customers. We will continue to invest in our people through training and safety programs to ensure they are equipped with the skills to provide the highest levels of customer service and to promote a safe work environment.
Our outlook for 2010 is positive as we build upon the momentum created in 2009. The strong earnings and cash flow generated last year leaves LKQ in a stronger-than-ever position to execute our strategy. We have an unwavering commitment to providing cost effective, environmentally-sensitive solutions for the repair of collision damage and the replacement of car and truck mechanical parts. By continuing to execute this plan, we should deliver increasingly strong results for our stockholders.
