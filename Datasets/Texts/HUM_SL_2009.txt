Despite a fragile economy and a volatile political environment, Humana completed a successful 2009 highlighted by solid revenues and earnings growth. We extended our leadership in consumer health benefits even as we expanded our horizons to embrace an invigorating new dream – to help people achieve lifelong well-being.
In support of our traditional strengths
as well as this enhanced vision for the future, we pioneered innovative wellness programs that have the potential to measurably improve the health of our 10.3 million medical and 7.2 million specialty members as well as the general public. We also pointed the way toward practical solutions to some of society’s
most pressing health care conundrums – childhood obesity, the lack of electronic connectivity among doctors and patients, and out-of-control health spending – through results-oriented programs that displayed the spirit of renewal and resourcefulness that has characterized our firm since its founding almost 50 years ago.
For 2009, company revenues increased by 7 percent, to $30.96 billion, from $28.95 billion in 2008. Earnings per diluted common share for 2009 of $6.15 increased substantially from
the $3.83 per diluted common share we earned in 2008.

 Operational Discipline in a Tumultuous Environment
 Government Segment
Throughout the year, favorable performance in our Government Segment – particularly in Medicare – outweighed the negative effects of the general economy, the competitive environment, and the H1N1 virus on our Commercial business. Humana Military Healthcare Services remained a solid contributor, as it has for more than a decade.
We were pleased to close 2009
with an appreciable gain in net-new Medicare Advantage enrollment.
Ending membership rose from just
over 1.4 million at December 31 of
last year to approximately 1.5 million
at December 31, 2009 – a net gain
of nearly 73,000 members. We also
saw a significant shift toward network- product enrollment as we continued
to increase the size and scope of our Medicare provider networks throughout the year. Membership in our Medicare Advantage network products grew by
28 percent in 2009 versus 2008. These favorable outcomes were achieved despite becoming the first major company to incorporate member premiums across our Private Fee-for-Service benefit designs.
For 2010, we again structured premiums and benefits to conform to the changing payment environment. Additionally, we are increasingly realizing the beneficial effect of our progress on our “15 percent solution”
– our commitment to provide Medicare Advantage services to our senior members, with enhanced quality, for at least 15 percent less than it costs the federal government to provide the same or lesser services – which helps mitigate the effect of this changing environment and allows our value proposition to remain strong.
Initial results from the 2010 selling season show higher Medicare Advantage membership retention ahead of previous expectations. Medicare Advantage
plan membership grew approximately 220,000 in January, bringing our
January 31, 2010 enrollment to approximately 1,729,000. Importantly, we also saw the continued growth in
members opting for network-based products, with 71 percent of our fully- insured Medicare Advantage enrollment choosing coordinated care plans. In addition to the individuals who are joining our plans, employer groups are beginning to see the benefits of Medicare Advantage as a solution
to their retiree-health care coverage needs. Our breadth of product offerings nationally positions us well to grow
in the group Medicare market.
The other major portion of our Government business involves our long-standing relationship with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to administer a contract under its TRICARE

In mid-2009, we learned that the DoD had awarded the third generation TRICARE contract for the South Region to another contractor. However, we were encouraged later in the year when the Government Accountability Office (GAO) upheld Humana Military’s protest of that contract award. In December 2009, the DoD’s TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) notified the GAO of its intent to take corrective action with respect to
the GAO’s decision, though we cannot determine what specific actions TMA will take and whether such actions would change the award of the contract. In
the meantime, we continue to deliver
outstanding service under the current contract – which TMA has notified us will be extended through March 2011.
Commercial Segment
With respect to our Commercial Segment, the ongoing external pressures noted previously resulted in a downturn in our results for 2009 versus the prior year. However, we believe that effective monitoring of medical cost data allowed us to begin raising premiums early enough in 2009 to overcome these issues for 2010. In addition, growth
in our ancillary and specialty products, together with our enterprise-wide administrative cost savings initiatives, position us favorably for stabilization in Commercial earnings moving into 2010.
On the whole, we’re taking a deliberate, strategic, long-term approach to creating the efficient and agile infrastructure we’ll need to take advantage of future growth opportunities, in this segment and throughout the enterprise.
Positive developments within our Commercial Segment this past year include growth in our individual
and specialty benefits businesses. HumanaOne individual membership grew 13 percent during 2009 and now totals more than 367,000 members. Specialty benefits membership also grew this past year, totaling approximately
7.2 million members at the end of 2009, 7 percent more than at the end of 2008.

Consumer Programs with Healthy Results
5 2009AnnualReport
As an active participant in the health-reform debate, Humana is taking an increasingly prominent role in launching programs that attack a fundamental accelerator of our health-care crisis – widespread unhealthy behaviors, leading to out-of-control costs. To demonstrate how childhood obesity can be curtailed, for example, The Humana Foundation partnered with 20 members
of Congress – 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans – on the innovative American Horsepower Challenge. This unique, Humana-created exercise/videogame initiative, which features pedometers linked to computers, showed its ability to increase middle schoolers’ activity while they have fun and engage in friendly competition. At the end of the initial four-week program, the nearly 1,600 participating students and 20 members of Congress had walked a combined 132 million steps – just over 50,000 miles –
and burned 2.25 million calories. If the miles walked had been driven in a car, the carbon emissions would have equaled 22.1 metric tons. Importantly, even as
this three-semester program comes to an end, the Georgia Institute of Technology will continue to study the ongoing health benefits that the American Horsepower Challenge has had on its participants.
Similar success was achieved through Humana’s signature Freewheelin bike- sharing program. As the lead sponsor of the 2009 Summer National Senior Games in Palo Alto, California, Humana provided athletes and spectators with access to Freehweelin bikes. By the end of the two-week event, Freewheelin riders had taken 2,406 rides, pedaled 11,072 miles, burned 343,241 calories and reduced their carbon footprint by 3.9 metric tons.
 
 Lifelong Well-Being: An Enhanced Strategy for Future Growth
From a strategic perspective, we felt 2009 a good time to step back and take a fresh look at our strategic direction resulting in the expansion of our strategic horizons to embrace an invigorating new dream – to help people achieve lifelong well-being.
This vision is solidly grounded in our successful concentration on consumer- focused innovation over the past decade while at the same time embracing a more comprehensive strategy for future growth. Besides physical health, well- being includes financial, social, and even community health. Our focus therefore
Humana’s 15% Solution
is broadening to emphasize cross-selling and the development of life-enhancing ancillary products and services. While still in its early stages, lifelong well-being is a promising expansion of Humana’s proven strength: our appeal to the individual consumer on a one-to-one basis.

 Our focus is broadening to emphasize cross-selling and the development of life- enhancing ancillary products and services. While still in
its early stages, lifelong well-being is a promising expansion of Humana’s proven strength: our appeal to the individual consumer on a one-to-one basis.
These efforts will benefit immensely
from the wisdom and experience of the two newest members of our Board of Directors. William E. Mitchell, chairman of the board and former chief executive officer of Arrow Electronics, has created and executed information-technology solutions for a variety of enterprises worldwide. He brings his expertise to bear on Humana’s industry-leading health information-technology initiatives like
Availity, the multipayor provider portal we co-founded in 2001. David B. Nash, M.D., founding dean of the Jefferson School of Population Health at Thomas Jefferson University, is a widely recognized innovator in an emerging medical discipline that unites population health, health policy, and individual health. He is an ideal guide as we broaden our traditional boundaries and create an exciting new platform for future growth.

      In Summary
It remains too early to tell what kind,
if any, of health reform will be enacted in Washington. Rather than focusing on possible outcomes and their potential implications, we are concentrating instead – as we have throughout our history – on initiatives that will continue to position us well regardless of the political environment. They are:
• consumer-focused products;
• driving productivity in
medical spending;
• robust actionable data; and
• constant innovation to engage our members actively in improving their health and well-being.
With our proven ability to appeal to senior customers while successfully managing the regulatory environment over more than 20 years, we intend
to grow membership in Medicare
while enhancing our coordinated care model to keep increasing the value we offer our members. We also anticipate improved Commercial results associated with contributions from our ancillary and specialty businesses, administrative expense reductions, and pricing
actions taken early last year. Finally,
our emerging emphasis on lifelong well-being holds promise for future growth in new revenue-producing areas that leverage Humana’s long-held strengths in one-to-one sales, service, and customer retention.
Sincerely,
David A. Jones, Jr. Chairman of the Board Significant Stockholder
Michael B. McCallister Director, President and Chief Executive Officer Significant Stockholder
  We are concentrating – as we have throughout our history – on initiatives that will continue to position us well regardless of the political environment.
