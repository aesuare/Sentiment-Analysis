 Dear Goodyear Shareholders,
We find ourselves in the midst of very interesting times. Today’s economic uncertainties and the new economic realities of
the world have significant implications for the tire industry and for Goodyear.
The global economic slowdown increased both in severity and geographic scope throughout 2008. By year end, the economy had a significant impact on volume in each of our business units, which negatively impacted our fourth quarter results.
We should not let the global economic decline overshadow the many positive actions we took and the results we achieved in 2008 as we successfully executed against our strategies. Through three quarters, our segment operating income was up 5 percent from 2007 despite slowing economic growth. Let me highlight some of our key achievements for the year:
• Total sales of $19.5 billion, about equal to 2007 despite the economic slowdown.
• Global revenue per tire up 8 percent.
• Price and mix improvements offset raw material cost increases of approximately 13 percent, thanks to some strong early pricing actions and solid product mix improvements.
• Record revenue in three of our regions: Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific.
• Share of market for Goodyear-branded products increased in our major markets.
• The Latin America and Asia Pacific businesses reported record segment operating income.
• Significant progress against our 4-point cost savings plan generated more than $700 million in savings in 2008 alone.
• Major restructuring actions, including the shutdown of our Tyler, Texas, and Somerton, Australia, manufacturing facilities.
• The implementation and funding of the VEBA Trust – our innovative approach to dealing with the health care costs of our United Steelworker retirees in the U.S.
• Aggressively curtailed tire production to better manage our inventories and our working capital needs.
• Full year segment operating income of more than
$800 million. This performance is evidence of the power of our core business model and the strategic drivers we’ve implemented over the last several years.
• Named by Fortune Magazine as “The World’s Most Admired Motor Vehicle Parts Company” and named by Forbes as one of “America’s Most Respected Companies” and additionally we were on Forbes’ list of “Most Trustworthy Companies
in America.”
These points are important because they provide us with a solid operating base from which to address what we expect will be a challenging business environment again in 2009.

   Time for Extraordinary Actions
These extraordinary times require extraordinary actions. It is very clear to us that given the challenging 2009 economic environment, our intense focus on the Seven Strategic Drivers remains a solid strategic foundation. As we address the market challenges head-on, we are not creating a new path. Rather, we will be taking a proven path to the next level. In fact, I would say our Seven Drivers resonate operationally today even more than they did back in 2003 when we first committed to them.
As I’ve continually said, everything we accomplish at Goodyear starts with leadership. I emphasize leadership because success against our other six Drivers simply is not possible without outstanding leaders in place throughout our company.
With leadership as our core, there are three specific areas that will keep us on our proven path toward success. These areas are:
• Top Line – encompassing new product leader-
ship, building our core brand strength and leveraging our industry-leading distribution network.
• Lowering Our Costs – aggressively aligning our cost structure with today’s lower industry volumes.
• Managing for Cash – focusing on the strength of our balance sheet and generating funds to reinvest in our business.
Top Line
The unmatched capability of our new product engine has quickly become the “Public Face of the New Goodyear.” Our industry-leading new product engine has delivered an unprecedented number of innovative, award-winning new

products at a pace previously unattainable in our industry. As a result, we have been able to:
• Drive a richer, more-profitable product mix
and increase our revenue per tire.
• Consistently offset higher raw material costs
with improved price and product mix.
• Increase the share of market of Goodyear-
branded products.
• Introduce new products that have had
dramatic revenue and margin impact and that have consistently gained overwhelming endorsements
from independent third-
party sources. Most recently, both Goodyear-brand and Dunlop-brand tires dominat- ed the results of the critical European winter tests that consumers rely on to guide their purchase decisions. Our new product offerings
have continually energized our
industry-leading network of tire dealers. In today’s economic environment, our new product engine and outstanding dealer network are critical. Globally, we will introduce more than
50 innovative, high-impact new products in
2009. Our dealers in all regions of the world are supportive and appreciative of our efforts. During challenging economic times, new products, strong dealer support and innovative marketing programs will be the core revenue-generating strengths for Goodyear.
In 2009, a key product introduction for the North American market is the Assurance Fuel Max tire, a new product with fuel saving technology that means consumers can potentially save 2,600 miles’ worth of gas over the life of
the tire when compared with our previous and hugely successful Assurance tire. This tire provides 27 percent less rolling resistance – so it rolls easier and requires less power. That
27 percent equates to a 4 percent overall improvement in highway fuel economy and less money spent at the gas pump.
Lowering Our Costs
Since announcing our 4-point cost savings plan in 2005, we
have implemented $1.8 billion in cost reductions. In addition, we’ve eliminated approximately 25 million units of high-cost production capacity. We continue on our path to have more than 50 percent of our total capacity in low-cost countries by the 2012 timeframe. At year-end 2008 we were at 43 percent.
To address the current environment, we have implemented significant reductions in our global workforce, a process that has been ongoing for the last six years. Since the middle of 2008, we
have eliminated more than 5 percent of our global workforce or almost 4,000 positions.
In addition to the implementation of the VEBA Trust, we implemented a salaried pension benefit freeze in the U.S. as we migrated to a defined contribution retirement plan.
Our planned cost actions for 2009 are nothing less than a continued “attack” on our cost structure, with the intent of driving our breakeven
point considerably lower. We are raising our 4-point plan target to $2.5 billion by the end of 2009. We will meet this target by: • Further reducing our global workforce by nearly 5,000.
From mid-year 2008 to the end of 2009, we will have taken
out almost 9,000 positions.
• Implementing a global freeze on salaries.
• Lowering our manufacturing cost through a combination of
shortened work weeks, reduced manufacturing personnel
and reduced third-party sourcing.
• Increasing our continuous improvement efforts through
lean manufacturing and Six Sigma processes.
• Delivering increased purchasing savings.
• Eliminating non-essential discretionary spending. • Continuing to close underperforming retail stores.
In addition to these 4-point plan actions, we are aligning our manufacturing capacity with lower industry demand. We plan to reduce manufacturing capacity by an additional 15 million to 25 million units over the next two years.
Managing for Cash
Our focus on managing for cash has guided our actions over
the past several years. Considering the current environment, we

are in a much better position today as a result of these past initiatives. These initiatives included:
• A series of debt transactions that extended our maturity
dates to a point where the only significant maturity we have
prior to 2011 is $500 million in December 2009.
• A highly successful equity offering in 2007.
• The VEBA Trust agreement, which eliminated more than
$1 billion in liabilities.
• The sale of non-core assets, including our engineered
products and fabric businesses at fair and attractive prices.
• A series of contingency actions beginning in 2008, including
cutting tire production, curtailing capital expenditures and reducing discretionary spending.
Our planned 2009 cash actions will continue to be aggressive.
We are implementing targeted inventory reductions made possible by significant improvements in our supply chain. We anticipate these reductions will reach more than $500 million or approximately 15 percent of inventory. We also are adjusting our capital expenditure plan and now expect spending of between $700 million and $800 million in 2009. In addition
we are pursuing non-core asset sales.
While we believe these actions are appropriate and address
the business challenges as we see them today, flexibility in this uncertain global economy is an imperative. As in 2008, we are preparing contingency actions beyond the initiatives outlined above. We are fully prepared to implement additional actions if market conditions further deteriorate.
Confidence in Goodyear
As macro economic challenges persist, I remain confident in Goodyear’s ability to drive performance. That confidence derives from:
• A “game-tested,” proven leadership team that I believe is
the best in our industry.
• A proven track record, based firmly on the strength of our
strategies.
• The continued success of our products in today’s marketplace,
our dedication to driving our innovative global new product engine and the strong marketing programs and network of successful dealers we wrap around our products.
• The significant actions we are taking to improve our cost structure.
• And, our absolute focus on managing for cash.
Our confidence is also bolstered by the constructive dialogue
we have had with our customers. They believe in us. As an example, at our February North American dealer conference in
Washington, D.C., we introduced 12 outstanding new products for the consumer tire business alone. We launched four new commercial products that targeted specific performance needs for a variety of truck applications. Our dealers were enthusiastic and hugely supportive of these product line additions. This is not just
a North American statement on new products. I’m simply using North America as an example. Our global offerings are unmatched in the industry. Globally we will introduce more than 50 new products this year. Our dealers in other regions of the world are equally supportive and appreciative of our efforts.
Prior to our annual dealer conference, we did not know what the dealers’ mindset would be given current business conditions. It quickly became clear they share the same calm and confident determination that is held by the Goodyear team. I was impressed. Dealer after dealer commented that our unprecedented focus on innovative new products in a down market provides them with both the products and the associated marketing tools to capture an increasing share of consumer purchases and further strengthens our mutual position for the future.
Ironically, we went to the dealer conference to energize our dealers. Instead, their positive attitude energized us. Times may be difficult, but they trust in Goodyear. Our track record
of innovation, our commitment to grow their businesses and our ability to rise above adversity gives them confidence.
Our goal in 2009 is to reward their – and your – confidence in us by aggressively position- ing Goodyear to weather this economic storm and to seize upon the opportunities when our markets rebound, as they inevitably will.
