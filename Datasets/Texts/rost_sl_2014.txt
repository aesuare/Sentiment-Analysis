                To Our Stockholders
Delivering bargains that our customers can count on every day will always be our top priority at both Ross Dress for Less and dd’s DISCOUNTS. We are pleased to report that the successful execution of this core strategy drove another year of solid sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2014.
Solid Sales and EPS Growth in Fiscal 2014
For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, sales grew 8% to $11.0 billion, up from $10.2 billion for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2014. Comparable store sales for 2014 increased 3% over the prior year.
Net earnings were $925 million in 2014, up from $837 million in the prior year. Earnings per share grew to $4.42 compared to $3.88 in 2013, up 14% on top of strong multi-year gains. Operating margin increased 35 basis points in 2014 to 13.5%, benefiting from a combination of higher merchandise gross margin and leverage on operating expenses.
Ongoing Store Growth and Expansion into New Markets
As planned, the Company opened 86 net new locations during the year, consisting of 64 Ross Dress for Less and 22 dd’s DISCOUNTS. We ended 2014 with a combined 1,362 stores in 33 states, the District of Columbia and Guam.
Our store growth included ongoing expansion of Ross Dress for Less in established regions as well as the new markets we entered beginning in October 2011. By the end of 2014, we operated a total of 81 Ross locations in Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Kentucky and Indiana. dd’s DISCOUNTS also entered five new states in 2014 including Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Oregon.
For 2015, we plan to open about 70 new Ross Dress for Less and 20 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about ten older locations.
We continue to believe that Ross Dress for Less can grow into a chain of at least 2,000 locations across the United States and that dd’s DISCOUNTS can eventually expand to about 500 stores. Combined, this reflects projected long-term domestic capacity of about 2,500 locations, providing us with significant store growth potential over the next several years.
Continued Gains in Sales and Profits at dd’s DISCOUNTS
dd’s DISCOUNTS delivered another year of solid gains in sales and ongoing operating profits in 2014. Like Ross, dd’s DISCOUNTS continued to benefit from their ability to deliver a faster flow of fresh and exciting product to their stores while operating on lower inventory levels. Its solid performance also reflects that dd’s customers continue to respond favorably to its compelling value offerings.
Healthy Cash Flows Fund Growth and Ongoing Stock Repurchases
Operating cash flows in 2014 helped fund new store expansion and infrastructure improvements to support our long-term growth. We invested approximately $650 million of capital during the year, including about $200 million to open new locations and update existing stores, $240 million for distribution and information technology projects,

                and $210 million for the acquisition of our New York Buying Office building, which we financed with a $250 million bond offering. We ended the year with approximately $700 million in cash and short-term investments and $400 million in long-term debt.
For fiscal 2015, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $450 million to fund new store openings as well as ongoing infrastructure investments, including the completion of another new distribution center.
During 2014, we repurchased $550 million of common stock, or about 7.4 million shares, under the two-year $1.1 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors at the beginning of 2013. In February 2015, we announced a new two-year $1.4 billion stock repurchase program to be completed during fiscal 2015 and 2016. Our Board also approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $.235 per share, up 18% on top of an 18% increase in the prior year.
The growth of our stock repurchase and dividend programs has been driven by the large amounts of cash our business generates after funding store expansion and other capital needs. We have repurchased stock
as planned every year since 1993 and have also raised our quarterly cash dividend annually since 1994. This consistent record reflects our unwavering commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns.
Flexible Business Model Enhances Long-Term Profitability
We are pleased with the solid sales and earnings growth we achieved in 2014. In 2015, we will continue to focus on the initiatives that have driven our success over the past several years.
First, our top priority will always be delivering the best values possible to our customers. As a result, we will continue to make strategic investments in merchandising. The people and processes of this critical organization are key to gaining access to the most desirable name brand products available in the marketplace.
Second, we will continue to operate our business with lean selling store inventory levels. Over the past several years, we have reduced in-store inventories by more than 40%, which has contributed to improved sales and gross margins. For 2015, we are planning selling store inventories to be down slightly on top of these multi-year declines.

 Finally, we will continue to maintain tight expense control throughout our entire Company. This has helped drive profitability while still enabling us to invest in the most vital areas of our business to support our long-term growth.
Looking ahead, we are excited and optimistic about our long-term prospects, as we believe that off-price will remain a strong-performing sector of the retail industry for the foreseeable future. We know that consistently delivering bargains our customers can count on every day will always be the key to enhancing our opportunities for growth in both sales and profits over the short and long term.
Social Responsibility at Ross
The six Ross Dress for Less stores we opened in Northern California in 1982 have grown into the largest off-price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States, with 1,210 locations at the end of 2014. dd’s DISCOUNTS, which we launched in 2004, had 152 stores at year end. Our success over the past 32 years has been driven by an unwavering commitment to creating value, with a focus on excellence, ethics and integrity in all we do. This extends far beyond our mission of offering customers
great name brand bargains. It also means enhancing the lives of more than 71,400 associates by providing a work environment where they can grow and succeed.
Our greatest assets are the people that work in our stores, distribution centers and offices. They play a key role in delivering great value to our customers and we want to recognize their hard work and commitment in contributing to our ongoing success. Further, we continue to support the communities where we operate through local hiring and philanthropic efforts, including a foundation we established in 2013 that supports our charitable mission to help create a brighter future for today’s youth. In addition, we continually look for ways to strengthen operating efficiencies while minimizing our impact on the environment.
In closing, we would like to thank all of our customers, business partners and stockholders for their continued support.
Sincerely,
      Norman A. Ferber Michael Balmuth
