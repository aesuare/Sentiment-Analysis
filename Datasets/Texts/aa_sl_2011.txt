Whenever someone tells me, "I have good news and bad news," I always ask for the bad news first. For Alcoa in 2011, the bad news was that aluminum, one of the world's most liquid commodity assets, became a proxy for the uncertainty in the world economy. As Europe showed substantial weakness in the second half of the year, and the forward price of aluminum on the London Metal Exchange (LME) dropped dramatically in May from $2,800 to roughly $2,000 per metric ton by December, so too did the stock performance of Alcoa and our peer companies. We are acutely aware of the dramatic impact that Alcoa's share price drop had on so many people. For you, our shareholders, it was particularly disappointing given that earlier in the year Alcoa had risen to be one of the top three performers in total shareholder return among all Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) companies. For our managers and employees, it was frustrating that external factors overshadowed the good work they were doing on the shop floor and with our customers. I have reflected long and hard on the implications of the unusual events of 2011 for Alcoa and for the aluminum industry. Let me share my thoughts with you. The good news is that in an ironic way, Alcoa's performance in that volatile year actually validated the fundamental strength of our Company and the strong prospects for Alcoa and for aluminum. Even as the LME price dropped, physical demand for aluminum remained strong and grew worldwide by 10 percent over the course of 2011, while regional premiums approached all-time highs. Because of how we responded to the economic crisis of 2008-2009 with our Cash Sustainability Program, we began 2011 with a strong balance sheet and a solid cash position. Our rise as a top performer in the DJIA in the beginning of 2011 and the fact that we ended the year with our stock performing better than our aluminum peers reinforced Alcoa's resilience in coping with adversity and our strong investment fundamentals.

Aluminum peers include aluminum and alumina producing companies with a market capitalization of at least $3 billion (as of 2010) and some publicly traded shares: Aluminum Corporation of China Limited, United Company RUSAL, Norsk Hydro ASA, Alumina Limited, National Aluminum Company Limited, and Shandong Nanshun Aluminium Co., Ltd.

2011 Financial Performance
The theme of this report, "Alcoa Won't Wait", is appropriate for Alcoa's operating performance in 2011. We didn't allow external forces in the markets, forces that we couldn't control, to distract us from doing what we do best: making money by producing quality products. Productivity, volume, and price mix improvements of more than $1 billion resulted in doubling profits over 2010; strong organic growth drove a 19 percent increase in revenues; and reductions in working capital and capital expenditures helped us to end 2011 with significantly more cash and less net debt than at the end of 2010.

Outstanding Financial Performance in 2011*

· Income from continuing operations of $614 million, or $0.55 per share · Excluding impact of special items, income from continuing operations of $812 million, or $0.72 per share

· Revenue of $25 billion, up 19 percent vs. 2010 · Adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion · Free cash flow of $906 million · Days working capital at a record low 27 days

Every one of our four business segments delivered for Alcoa. Flat-Rolled Products and Engineered Products and Solutions each achieved historic highs in profitability and drove strong organic growth in 2011. In our upstream operations, the Alumina business continued to return to historic high profit levels, and our Primary Metals business, where the LME price drop and rise in raw materials cost had the greatest impact, finished the year about 20 percent below the 10-year average profitability. For each of our three operating groups, 2011 also created a strong base to meet our longer term growth goals. Global Primary Products (GPP): In our upstream business, we have been driving operational efficiencies and aggressively managing energy costs to drive our smelters and refineries down the cost curve and improve our cash flow. For example, in 2011, GPP reduced "Days Working Capital" (DWC) by four days and reduced its total working capital by $130 million, or 12 percent. Our long-term objective is to improve our refinery position from the 30th percentile in 2010 to the 23rd percentile in 2015, and our smelter position from the 51st percentile in 2010 to the 41st percentile in 2015. Given the long-term nature of this business, these 2015 targets cannot be reached overnight; restructuring and investment programs are in place to achieve them. Flat-Rolled Products (FRP): In our midstream business, we achieved $1.4 billion in organic growth in 2011, which is 55 percent of our $2.5 billion 2013 incremental revenue growth target. A seven percent increase in volume, along with shifts in the Group's portfolio towards higher margin products, drove FRP's historic profit performance and record adjusted EBITDA/MT. Growth projects in Russia, China, and Davenport, Iowa, are capturing global opportunities that will contribute to our top-line growth while achieving higher profitability. Engineered Products and Solutions (EPS): Our downstream business achieved 44 percent of its 2013 revenue increase target of $1.6 billion, with approximately $700 million in organic growth in the first year. Every downstream business unit ­ Fasteners, Forgings, Power and Propulsion, Wheels, and Building and Construction ­ contributed to that success by driving revenue growth through new product introductions and share gains. EPS also acquired the aerospace fastener manufacturer TransDigm, which contributed $58 million in revenue in 2011.

Much of the success of our businesses in 2011 was due to the continuation of the Cash Sustainability Program, which we originally launched to successfully navigate the economic crisis of 2008-2009. Late in 2011, as it became evident that economic uncertainty in Europe, price volatility, and rising costs for raw materials and energy would continue into 2012, we launched a new phase of the Cash Sustainability Program. Now, we've set even more ambitious goals for improvements in productivity, procurement, working capital, overhead, quality, and technology. As our first step, we announced the curtailment of 12 percent of our smelting portfolio, representing some of our highest-cost smelters, which will further improve the cost profile of our GPP portfolio. Across the spectrum of our businesses, we will build on the strategic and operational progress we made in 2011.

Regional Growth
In 2011, we had solid contributions from all our regions with the exception of Europe, where the economy had a negative impact on FRP and high energy prices depleted GPP's profitability in Italy and Spain. Let me also update you on those countries where Alcoa made strategic investments in recent years:

China
Our base in China is built around imports, mainly of alumina and midstream manufacturing in country. To expand our presence in that growing region, especially Alcoa's fabricated business segments, in 2011, we developed a relationship with the respected China Power Investment Corporation (CPI). One of the first steps is an agreement in February 2012 to form an Alcoa-CPI joint venture company to produce high-end fabricated aluminum products for the aerospace, automotive, commercial transportation, consumer electronics, and packaging markets in China. Majority-owned and managed by Alcoa, the Shanghai-based joint venture will be an important step in our strategy for profitable growth in the dynamic China market.

Brazil
After years of construction in Brazil, our operations in Juruti and São Luís are now at full production capacity. At our Juruti mine, for example, we increased production in 2011 by 50 percent while at the same time reducing cash costs 30 percent by the end of the year. With a hydro dam at Estreito moving toward peak capacity, we are driving down the aluminum and alumina cost curves while benefitting from cleaner power.

Saudi Arabia
As I discussed in last year's annual report, at the end of 2009, Alcoa formed a joint venture with the Saudi Arabian Mining Company, Ma'aden, to build the largest and lowest-cost integrated aluminum facility in the highly populated Middle East region, where infrastructures are developing to keep pace with growing consumer demand. The project leverages efficiencies from integrating the mine, refinery, smelter, and rolling mill, and from low energy costs embedded in a brand new infrastructure environment. The construction is on budget and on schedule for all four segments, with the smelter and rolling mill scheduled to come on line in 2013 followed by the mine and refinery in 2014.

Customer Value Through Innovation
It is important to consider how, in a year of single-digit end market growth, Alcoa achieved a 19 percent revenue increase, primarily from organic growth. I believe that there were two key drivers of that growth. First, in every one of our key markets ­ aerospace, automotive, consumer electronics, packaging, commercial transportation, building and construction, and industrial ­ customers are seeking cost savings from greater energy efficiency, fuel reductions, and recyclability. Second, Alcoa innovation is providing customers the means to achieve those savings. The rising cost of fuel is one major factor driving aircraft manufacturers to dramatically reduce the weight of their planes, and the lightweight material of choice remains aluminum. Our advanced aluminum-lithium alloys promise a 10 percent weight reduction and 30 percent life-cycle cost savings, and we believe they will continue to be the right choice for aircraft, ensuring an aluminum-centric fleet for at least the next 10 to 15 years.

Most of the 1,700 new orders at the 2011 Paris Air Show consisted of Airbus 320neo and Boeing 737 MAX narrow body planes.

At the Paris Air Show, Airbus awarded Alcoa a multi-year supply agreement for aluminum sheet and plate products that use our advanced-generation alloys. This strengthens the Alcoa-Airbus relationship across virtually all Airbus commercial aircraft programs, allowing us to provide a wide range of products from fasteners to fuselage panels to Airbus' newest wing skins. We also continue to build on our strong relationship with Boeing. At the air show, we also announced a partnership with Spirit AeroSystems to jointly produce a revolutionary fuselage panel for commercial airliners that uses Alcoa's third-generation Al-Li 2060 aluminum-lithium alloy ­ lighter, lower-cost, and with lower production risks than composite-intensive aircraft. Innovations from Alcoa's downstream manufacturing businesses also play a vital role in improving aircraft efficiencies. For instance, Alcoa's Power and Propulsion business produces advanced cooling designs and thermal coatings that allow jet engine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to increase turbine operating temperatures, reduce weight and emissions, and improve efficiencies, while avoiding potential durability issues from these harsher operating conditions. This means jet engine manufacturers can build hotter-running engines that have greater fuel efficiencies and reduced nitrogen oxide emissions. As a result of our innovations in fastener solutions, we have increased our fastener content in new aerospace platforms versus legacy programs, and have boosted our content of new patented products. For instance, we developed a range of fasteners for the Boeing 787 and the Airbus 350 to integrate the function of lightning strike management with the structural fastening of the airframe. Combined with our content on the Boeing 767, the new fasteners on these three platforms will generate over $120 million in increased revenue by 2013. Extrusions made from Alcoa's third-generation aluminum-lithium alloys are currently flying on fuselage and wing applications for large commercial airframes, and our segmented die forgings coupled with our proprietary cold-worked, stress-relieving process are used to deliver the largest forgings in the industry, including the aluminum inner rear spar of the A380. This monolithic piece saves Airbus weight and cost and improves performance. In the industrial gas turbine market, OEMs are looking for efficiencies, reduced nitrogen oxide, and an improvement in the number of start-stop cycles and operating hours. Our Alcoa Power and Propulsion business has developed an advanced platform core technology that allows us to direct cooling air in a gas turbine blade where it wasn't possible before, allowing the industrial gas turbine to run at higher temperatures while keeping the platform temperatures below the oxidation point. The resulting higher firing temperature yields greater turbine efficiency, increased power output, and lower emissions. Alcoa is also driving a greater use of aluminum in the global ground transportation and automotive industries as they seek fuel cost savings and reduced emissions from weight reduction. Since 1990, the increased use of aluminum in the world's vehicle fleet has avoided putting one billion tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere and saved more than 84 billion liters of gasoline ­ results welcomed by regulators, manufacturers, and consumers alike. As the automotive sector seeks greater fuel efficiency, we see a potential for over 10 million metric tons of new sales, with an expected growth of 7.5 times today's consumption in global automotive sheet in flat-rolled products. Since the U.S. CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) regulations require an average of 35.5 miles per gallon (mpg) for automobiles by 2016 and may go up to 54.5 mpg by 2025, the use of aluminum in cars manufactured for the U.S. market will grow dramatically. To meet that demand, in September we

announced a $300 million investment to expand our Davenport, Iowa, rolled products plant. Earlier, in June, U.S. President Barack Obama visited Davenport Works, where we told him how that facility has been building America's planes and spacecraft for decades. I feel great pride knowing that once again the teamwork and passion of Alcoans is opening up a new frontier of advanced manufacturing in the U.S. We're applying Alcoa innovation in many regional and end markets. For BYD, a Chinese "green energy" technology manufacturer, we developed an all-aluminum bus space frame that also incorporates Alcoa forged aluminum wheels and fasteners. Our prototype reduces the weight of the BYD electric bus body by 40 percent (nearly one ton) versus steel options. BYD plans to produce thousands of the electric buses for the Asian market and for export. In Russia, we are providing our advanced aluminum sheet Prototypes of BYD's electric buses hit alloy 1565M to the Russian the road in China's Hunan Province tanker and semi-trailer maker, Becema, to build a lightweight aluminum cement hauler. By using Alcoa's new advanced sheet alloy, the weight of the tank body has been reduced by 25-30 percent over traditional aluminum alloy and reduced three times over the weight of a steel tank. And in the U.S., our technologists are working with defense contractors to keep soldiers safe. One of our rolled and forged product innovations is an armor alloy solution based on Alcoa's latest ArmXTM 7085 products. Aluminum armor kits are currently being fielded through Oshkosh DefenseTM for the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) A4, which provide critical blast protection for the vehicle.

2011 SUSTAINABILITY HIGHLIGHTS
For the tenth consecutive year, Alcoa was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and was also honored as the Aluminum Sector Industry Leader.

Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes
The U.S. Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) recognized Alcoa for our transparency in reducing emissions and mitigating the risks of climate change in our operations. The CDP featured Alcoa on its Carbon Performance Leadership Index ­ one of only 11 companies ranked. The revolutionary Reynobond ® with EcoCleanTM is the first coil-coated architectural panel that cleans itself and reduces air pollution. In fact, 10,000 square feet of Reynobond with EcoClean installed on a building's surface has the approximate air cleaning power of 80 trees.

Architectural panel without EcoCleanTM

In many developed countries, buildings are one of the largest energy-consuming and GHG-emitting sectors (in the U.S., they account for 72 percent of all electricity consumption and 38 percent of all carbon dioxide [CO2] emissions). While the commercial construction market is in recession, we have been preparing for the inevitable turnaround in the industry through strategic acquisitions and innovation. In 2011, we completed the integration of the commercial window business of Traco; Alcoa now has the most comprehensive product portfolio in the industry and groundbreaking innovation in this sector. We introduced the revolutionary Reynobond® with EcoCleanTM, an architectural panel that actually cleans itself and the air around it. We also have developed curtain walls that improve thermal performance by 25 percent and aluminum sunshades that cut solar heat gain by half. Our strategy for the fast-growing consumer electronics market is to capitalize on aluminum's light weight, durability, heat conductivity, and limitless surface finishes. To build on the life-cycle benefits of aluminum, we took a minority share in Electronic Recyclers International (ERI), the largest U.S. recycler of electronics waste. This partnership allows Alcoa to bring its expertise in recycling to the growing challenge of e-waste and to enhance the role aluminum plays in making electronics more sustainable.

Architectural panel with EcoCleanTM

Alcoa and CPI agreed to work together to develop smelting and clean energy projects to help China derive 15 percent of its energy from non-fossil fuel sources by 2020. Alcoa was recognized by the respected Exame Sustainability Guide 2011 for our social responsibility model around our bauxite mining activity in the Juruti Velho region of Brazil.

Finally, the increased demand for recyclable products is driving growth in our global packaging business. For example, in 2011, the aluminum can market grew two to three percent, led by strong performance in China and Brazil. And in Western Europe, the aluminum can continues to gain share against the steel can. In each of our end markets, Alcoa innovation is delivering value for our customers in an environment where they need us more than ever. Among all of the world's aluminum companies, Alcoa has the technology leadership, established customer base, and global presence to address our customers' needs. It's for that reason that we say, "Alcoa Won't Wait."

Our Enduring Values
Our Values are the foundation for everything Alcoa has achieved in 2011, and for the past 125 years. They helped us cope with the recent volatility in our markets and they are our True North as we chart the course of Alcoa's future. We are honest and ethical in all of our business dealings, we respect one another, we care for the natural environment, and we protect the health and safety of our employees. Consider our 2011 safety record. We ended the year with a total injury recordable rate of 1.24, an eight percent improvement over 2010 and a remarkable 72 percent better than the U.S. Manufacturing Average of 4.4. Forty-eight percent of our locations did not log a single recordable injury or illness, and 79 percent did not experience a single lost work day case. While in 2011 we did not experience a single employee fatality, that record was diminished with the occurrence of one contractor fatality. This painful incident has driven us to intensify our efforts to ensure that everyone ­ whether employee or contractor ­ knows that we hold all who work at an Alcoa facility to the same high safety standards. We are also committed to the health of our environment. Alcoa's GPP business lowered its CO2 intensity by 23 percent from 2005 levels, a big step towards our 2030 goal of a 30 percent reduction. These reductions are the result of our promoting best practices to reduce process emissions, and a continual drive toward energy efficiency, especially in refining where we achieved a three percent reduction in CO2 intensity in 2011. We have received widespread recognition for how Alcoans live their Values. For the tenth year in a row, Alcoa was chosen to be on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and the Covalence Ethical Rankings again placed Alcoa at number one in its Basic Resources category. The ranking looks at Alcoa's ethics, labor standards, waste management, and human rights policy, and confirms the Values that Alcoans have lived for generations. Around the world, in virtually every Alcoa community, the Company has received recognition for the good work of our employees.

Alcoa Australia employees planted trees in support of Alcoa's Ten Million Trees initiative.

In 2011, Alcoa and Alcoa Foundation provided combined community giving of $38 million, with an emphasis on the environment; Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education; and workforce development in manufacturing. In these and other areas, Alcoans were more active in their communities than ever before, serving with big hearts and high enthusiasm. In October, we hit a new Month of Service all-time high, with 56 percent employee participation ­ double the average volunteer rate for other U.S.-based companies. More than 31,000 Alcoans worldwide gave their time and talent to revitalize green spaces, feed the hungry, improve schools, care for the elderly, and support other locally meaningful causes. In total, Alcoans served an astounding 892,738 people in communities around the world.

Looking Ahead
As we enter 2012, we remain cautious in the short-term and highly optimistic in the long-term. Volatility persists in Europe; political uncertainty could stall the U.S. recovery; and there is a possibility that the meteoric pace of economic growth in China may slow. Yet the long-term trends are very favorable to our businesses. With a growing world population, increased urbanization, and higher demand for lightweight and recyclable products, we expect that demand for aluminum will double between 2010 and 2020. At Alcoa we remain confident that we have the correct strategic priorities ­ profitable growth, disciplined execution, and Alcoa Advantage ­ to guide us through the uncertainties and capitalize on those trends. And, we have the financial discipline to support continued profitable growth in 2012 and beyond. Above all, we have a workforce of committed Alcoans who live our Values every day. Leading Alcoa in these times is an honor that I treasure. It drives me and our executive team every day. We can't wait ­ we won't wait ­ to find new and better ways to deliver value, consistently and responsibly, in good times and tough times, for our shareholders, our customers, our communities, and our employees.
