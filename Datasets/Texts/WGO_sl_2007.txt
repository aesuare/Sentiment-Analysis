To Our Fellow Shareholders
 We were pleased with our performance in fiscal 2007. While 2007 was certainly not a record year for the Company or the recreation vehicle (RV) industry, we worked hard to maximize our opportunities and were pleased with our performance in a challenging market. The economic environment during the fiscal year created challenges with high fuel prices and interest rates for our dealer partners and retail buyers that were considerably higher than their lows in calendar 2004. Regardless of challenging conditions, it is our continued goal to remain as profitable as possible in any given market.  To help us achieve a leadership position in profitability, we rely on three very important factors to drive our business: Innovation, Quality and Service. we worked closely with Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation to create the Freightliner XCL chassis and then further enhanced the XCL chassis with the addition of our own SuperStructure® design. The Maxum chassis features a lowered frame rail design that is seven times stronger than a similar raised rail chassis. This design provides a lower center of gravity which translates into superior ride and handling characteristics and incomparable exterior storage space ­ up to 220 cubic feet.  Other new diesel products for 2008 include a totally redesigned Winnebago Journey® and Itasca Meridian® and the brand new Winnebago Destination® and Itasca Latitude®. The Destination and Latitude offer a novel chassis choice ­ a standard Workhorse UFO rear engine gas chassis or an optional Freightliner rear engine diesel chassis. Placing the gas or diesel engine in the back of the motor home provides a quiet ride and a flat floor in the front of the motor home for versatile, residential-style floorplan designs.  We have experienced tremendous success with our fuelefficient Winnebago View® and Itasca Navion® Class C diesel motor homes, driving our Class C market share to a commanding 24.5 percent for calendar year to date through August 2007, significantly higher than our next closest competitor at 16.2 percent. For 2008, we are also offering these products in a Dodge Sprinter gas chassis configuration that is exclusive to Winnebago Industries. We also just introduced the all-new 2008 Itasca Navion iQTM model at the industry's fall RV shows in Harrisburg, PA and Pomona, CA. The Navion iQ represents the next step in Dodge Sprinter based product innovation. Available on the Dodge Sprinter diesel chassis, the Navion iQ is a low-profile motor home with a streamlined front-end design. It incorporates features that make the most of usable space like curved cabinetry and cab seats that rotate to become part of the living area. The Navion iQ is offered in two 24-foot floorplans and is an exclusive Itasca brand offering.

Innovation

 Innovation was a driving factor in our new 2008 model year motor home lineup, particularly in our diesel offerings. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., a retail reporting service for the RV industry, calendar year to date through August 2007 we had approximately 24.5 percent of the Class C retail market segment and 21.6 percent of the Class A gas segment. With 9.3 percent of the current Class A diesel market segment, we have identified this category as a great opportunity for growth.  In order to grow our market share and as a testament to our drive for innovation, our new 2008 model year lineup of Class A diesel models were completely revamped and include new chassis configurations, creative new floorplans, luxurious features and one-piece windshields.  At the top of our product lineup, the Winnebago Tour® and Vectra® and the Itasca Ellipse® and Horizon® feature an allnew MaxumTM chassis for 2008. To develop this application,

Contributing to the high level of our quality is our excellent workforce in Iowa with an average of over 12 years of service with the Company. Our use of technology in the design and manufacturing processes of building motor homes has also contributed to our high level of quality.

state that will eliminate non-value added activities. This powerful tool allows us to map the flow of products and information to allow us to see any potential weakness or wastes in the flow and to prioritize activities needed to achieve a better flow of products or processes.  We believe that our high level of quality is also one of the reasons we have been able to achieve the leading position in retail sales for seven consecutive years. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., an independent retail reporting service, we led the industry with 18.8 percent of retail sales of Class A and Class C motor homes combined for calendar year 2007 through August.

Service

 We excel in service to our dealer partners and motor home owners. In fact, we believe we have the most extensive service program in the industry and regularly score the highest of any of the public motor home manufacturers on our service and warranty support on the RVDA Dealer Satisfaction Index survey. This is driven by our extensive service support, including our exclusive Win Net dealer computer network for immediate warranty claim submittal and to place part orders electronically. Other service programs include the Preferred Care Warranty Plan and Premium Roadside Assistance Program for our motor home owners, as well as technical service, warranty and parts support for our dealers. We are also the only motor home manufacturer to have trained service district managers who provide a valuable link between our dealer network and Winnebago Industries with a wealth of service and warranty expertise. Our Owner Relations department also provides a staff of dedicated, trained professionals who are ready to assist our Winnebago Industries motor home customers.

repurchases and dividends, the company has returned $466.8 million to shareholders in the past decade.  The one question shareholders repeatedly ask us is when do we think the motor home market will start to grow again. While that is difficult to precisely predict, it is our belief that a return to growth in the motor home industry is tied to the general economy. We are encouraged that the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates in September 2007 and fuel prices have remained stable during recent months. This should bode well for the motor home industry.  We continue to believe in the long-term growth opportunities for our business. The long-term demographic trends continue to favor motor home market growth as the baby-boom generation continues to enter the prime motor home buying age of 50 years old and older. According to a 2005 University of Michigan study, the age at which people are entering the motor home market is also broadening. We have seen more buyers coming into the motor home market as early as 35 years old because they have found that motor homes fit their active outdoor lifestyle activities such as for tailgating, motor sports events and for towing their motorcycles, four-wheelers, boats and other "toys" for weekends or vacations. We have also seen motor home enthusiasts remaining in the RV lifestyle longer as they lead healthy and active lifestyles into their 70's.  We will continue to focus on product innovation, quality and service for our dealer partners and motor home customers. We believe this will continue to result in solid profitability and the best returns possible for our shareholders.

Outlook

 Market conditions remain soft due in part to higher fuel costs and interest rates, as well as lower consumer confidence levels due to sub-prime credit and other concerns. As we stated earlier, it is our goal to be profitable in any given market. In spite of these market concerns, we have consistently met this goal. Even with the downturn in the motor home market throughout the last three years, we are proud of our performance, remaining solidly profitable.  We continue to believe in the long-term strategy of returning profits to our shareholders. We believe that through the repurchase of our common stock and by increasing dividends, we are effectively achieving these goals. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased 2,160,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $64.7 million. As of August 25, 2007, we had $17.5 million remaining on the current share repurchase authorization. Since December 31, 1997, we have repurchased approximately 25.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $400.9 million. Additionally, we have paid $65.9 million in dividends to shareholders in the last ten years. When you combine the stock
