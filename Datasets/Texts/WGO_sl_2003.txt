To My Fellow Shareholders:
We are extremely pleased with Winnebago Industries' solidly profitable performance in fiscal 2003. Despite a sluggish economy with low consumer confidence, the war in Iraq, rising unemployment and fluctuating fuel prices, Winnebago Industries was able to produce record revenues and net income second only to the Company's record performance last year. Revenues for fiscal 2003 (52 weeks) were a record $845.2 million versus $825.3 million for the previous fiscal year (53 weeks). Net income for fiscal 2003 was $49.9 million versus $54.7 million for fiscal 2002. On a diluted per share basis, the Company earned $2.65 a share versus $2.68 a share for fiscal 2002. Included in net income was $1.2 million from discontinued operations, or six cents a share, in fiscal 2003, versus $1.8 million, or nine cents a share, in fiscal 2002. Once again, the hard work of our employees and dealers led to a successful year in a less than ideal economic environment. These outstanding results are not by accident, but due to our continued focus on profitability. This focus on profitability began in earnest in 1997 when we challenged ourselves to be the most profitable public company in the recreation vehicle (RV) industry. We measure our profitability by using four guidelines: Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), Operating Margin as a percent of sales and Net Profit Margin as a percent of sales. These statistics have been highlighted in our last three annual reports because of their importance as a means to measure our performance against that of our competitors. Winnebago Industries and the next five largest public motor home manufacturers used in this analysis accounted for approximately 70 percent of all Class A and C motor home sales during the first eight months of calendar 2003. The graphs below demonstrate that we continue to lead the public companies in the RV industry in profitability in nearly all measurements.

The Company's large cash balance provides us with security; however, due to the current interest rate environment, this amount on our balance sheet is actually detrimental to our Return on Assets measurement. At this Minnie Winnie time, we believe the best use for our excess cash is to return it to our shareholders through the repurchase of the Company's stock and through the increase in our cash dividends. Our Board has authorized eight stock repurchase programs beginning in December 1997 through August 30, 2003, having repurchased 8.7 million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $174.0 million during that time. This included the repurchase of 676,199 shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $20.2 million during fiscal 2003. On October 20, 2003, Winnebago Industries repurchased 1,450,000 shares of stock at $44.12 per share from Hanson Capital Partners, LLC, which is owned and controlled by the family of Company founder John K. Hanson and his wife, Luise. As of November 10, 2003, outstanding shares were 16,925,614. In addition to the repurchases of the Company's stock, we have now doubled our annual cash dividends by paying 10 cents a share to our shareholders on a quarterly basis, rather than semi-annually. In fiscal 2004, we expect to pay a total of 40 cents a share annually, versus the previous annual dividend of 20 cents a share. Winnebago Industries is the sales leader in the motor home market. According to Statistical Surveys, Inc., an independent retail reporting service, Winnebago Industries' retail market share of the total combined Class A and C motor home market leads the industry at 19.2 percent for the first eight months of calendar 2003, compared to 20.9 percent for the same period in calendar 2002. Motor home retail shipments slowed during the first four months of calendar 2003 due to concerns about the war in Iraq. Consequently, there was an oversupply of product on some dealers' lots. This led many RV manufacturers to use costly incentives to push their products into the market. We chose to correct our inventory imbalance primarily through the adjustment of our production schedule by removing seven full days of production, most of which was within our third fiscal quarter. As a management team, we were faced with the decision of using incentives to match our competitors in order to retain market share, or abide by our goal of managing for profitability. We maintained our primary goal to obtain the best possible return for our shareholders. While this led to

some softening of our market share, we felt profitability was our first concern. We have publicly stated many times that we are not interested in being the largest motor home manufacturer in terms of revenues, market share or volume, instead, it is our intention to be the best in terms of profitability. Part of the reason we're able to be more profitable than our competitors is we believe that Winnebago Industries also leads the industry in RV manufacturing technology. By utilizing the latest technology for the production of our motor homes, we believe we increase quality and maximize the productivity of our workforce and facilities. We also believe our vertical integration provides us with profit advantages. We build the majority of parts used in the production of our motor homes. Examples of this include building our own furniture, as well as manufacturing our own vacuum-formed plastics such as shower pans and front dashboard panels, rotational molded plastics such as water and wastewater holding tanks, and aluminum extruded parts for trim parts, as well as for strength and support within the motor home. Building high-quality motor homes is how we will continue to succeed in the RV industry. We consider the annual dealer satisfaction index (DSI) survey by the Recreation Vehicle Dealers Association to be a great measurement tool for not only product quality, but also the quality of our sales, management, service, warranty and support processes. The DSI helps us improve dealer/manufacturer relations by identifying how dealers perceive our strengths and weaknesses. We are extremely proud of our results from the 2002 DSI survey. Not only did we get the highest ratings of any RV manufacturer, we have received this Quality Circle award for the last seven years - the only RV manufacturer to achieve this status. We believe the last question on the survey sums it up best: Which manufacturer provides the product most valuable for your dealership's success? Winnebago Industries is again ranked the highest in this question with a 92.0 percent rating, scoring 6.2 basis points higher than the next closest motor home competitor. While 2003 was a challenging year due to the war in Iraq and low consumer confidence levels, we look for improvement in 2004. The current low interest rates are a catalyst for continued growth of the RV market in the near term. Approximately two thirds of our customers currently finance their motor home purchase. The low interest rate environment together with the potential of deductibility of interest paid on

We believe consumer confidence levels will rise as the job market improves throughout the United States. Winnebago Industries' executive management team has an average of 26 years tenure with the Company. I can honestly say that we have never seen a more positive future for the motor home industry. Demographics are certainly in our favor as our target market of consumers age 50 and older is expected to increase for the next 30 years. In addition to growth in our target market due to the aging of the baby boom generation, a study conducted by the University of Michigan for the RV industry shows that the age of people interested in purchasing RVs is also expanding to include younger buyers under 35 years of age as well as older buyers over age 75 who are staying healthy and active much later in life. This study also shows an increased interest in owning RVs by a larger percentage of all U.S. households. Owners are now using their motor homes for much more than just traditional camping. Motor homes are used to pursue consumers' many lifestyle passions which may include riding their ATVs in the desert, or going to motorsports events, or tailgating at sporting events or attending horse or dog shows. Consequently, we see people now purchasing motor homes who may never have dreamed of owning an RV before, simply to provide a means of support for their other

recreation choices. In order to continue to grow with the expanding motor home market, we completed a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Charles City, Iowa, to build Class C motor homes. This enables us to produce additional Class A models in our Forest City facility. Motor home production in the new Charles City facility began in March 2003 with a ramp-up of production throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. This is the largest expansion to date for Winnebago Industries and will increase our production capacity by approximately 30 percent. The additional capacity will help us meet the anticipated increase in demand for our motor homes in the future. The future indeed looks promising. The keys to our continued success remain in introducing innovative new products such as our Winnebago Vectra and Itasca Horizon diesel motor homes (featured later in this report), as well as having the highest quality product available in the marketplace. In addition, Winnebago Industries will continue to strive for the best shareholder return possible as we grow with the market into the future. In closing, we are saddened by the passing of Luise V. Hanson, wife of Winnebago Industries founder, the late John K. Hanson, on October 19, 2003 at the age of 90. Luise worked side-by-side with her husband during the formative years of Winnebago Industries and served on the Company's Board of Directors from 1958 to 1981. From 1981 to the time of her death, the Board honored her with the title of Director Emeritus. Luise played an invaluable role in W i n n e b a g o Industries' history and will be truly missed.
