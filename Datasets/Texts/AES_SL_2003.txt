Chairman and CEO Letter
To our shareholders:
2003 was a year of solid performance for AES. We
began the year with a number of ambitious goals. And then, we met them. We strengthened our financial posi- tion and balance sheet well ahead of schedule. We restructured key elements of our business portfolio and challenged our operating units to improve their perfor- mance dramatically. Now, while keeping an eye on the lessons of the past, a reenergized AES is focused on a promising future.
Our business is one of creating and managing valu- able long-term assets. Yet in the past few years, AES’s rapid growth left it with too much near-term debt, matur- ing faster than could be supported by operating cash flow. Our response was to raise $3.1 billion in debt and equity, extending our debt maturities more evenly through 2015. Overall, AES parent company debt was reduced by $1.2 billion last year. As a result, our publicly traded debt rallied to par or better by year-end. We are pleased with how quickly AES achieved these results. And we welcome the recent recognition of our improve- ment by the rating agencies despite the continued tur- moil facing much of the electric power industry. We expect to continue to reduce debt at the parent level, as our debt progresses toward investment grade.
This rapid turnaround required tough decisions about our business portfolio. To improve our liquidity and reduce our debt load, we sold 14 facilities in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and the US. Despite the
difficult market, these facilities sold at attractive prices, bringing in proceeds of $1.1 billion. The key, however, was not just selling businesses that could realize good value in a difficult market. It was also avoiding the sale of businesses that are essential to our business strategy. We met that test. Our asset sale program helped our short-term liquidity – and clearly affirmed the substantial market value of our global portfolio.
Several of our businesses required significant restructuring. Eletropaulo, our distribution company in São Paulo, Brazil, had a complex business structure and a heavy short-term debt burden. The restructuring process was prolonged and volatile. However, the agree- ment reached in the last days of 2003 preserves material value for AES and gives our Brazilian businesses a capi- tal structure more suited to their cash flow profile. Brazil’s government demonstrated its commitment to the fair treatment of foreign investors, who will play a crucial role in meeting the growing demand for power in Brazil.
Similarly, important progress was made in develop- ing a refinancing plan for Gener, our generation business in Chile. This is a solid business and the second-largest electricity generator in a country with bright long-term prospects. The equity injected into Gener will strengthen its balance sheet and help it return to financial health. The reinvigorated company is now poised to capitalize on the growth in the Chilean electricity sector and to be an important contributor in our global portfolio.

DEC Goal
    Our repositioning also demanded painful but nec- essary write-offs of past investments. These decisions were made to establish a sound business portfolio on which to build successfully in the future. For example, we wrote off our investment in Drax, a large merchant power plant in the United Kingdom. We originally had hoped to refinance Drax in a way that maintained an ownership interest for AES. In the end, however, the right decision was to turn over our ownership to the lenders when it became clear that no other scenario would produce acceptable returns for us. This kind of strict, disciplined decision-making is a critical dimension for us to maintain, particularly as we look toward renewed growth.
Our portfolio restructuring is largely completed. Our focus is now on improving operating performance. To do this, we have made a number of important changes in the past year. We have realigned our business leader- ship under two Chief Operating Officers, John Ruggirello for the Generation group, and Joe Brandt for the Integrated Utilities group. Additionally, new leaders have been appointed to senior positions across the enterprise.
We have carefully identified the key drivers of performance for our businesses and have set demanding goals. Success will mean that each AES business operates at top-quartile performance by 2006 and top-decile performance by 2008. Given the impressive
achievements of AES people last year, we are confident that industry-leading performance will be reached.
In the generation business, for example, an impor- tant driver of performance is high availability of our power plants. AES started the year with plant availability of 85%, which is about average performance in the US. So our people went to work to do better. We ended the year with plant availability of 88%, which moved us to top quartile performance. And we think we can still go further.
One of the main drivers of performance in the distribution business is reducing commercial losses. These losses result, for example, when customers con- nect to our system without paying. Our distribution busi- nesses in El Salvador alone reduced commercial losses by $2 million last year, so we know that dramatic improvement is possible. Many of our non-US utilities still have room for major improvement that could yield hundreds of millions of dollars of additional revenue with no additional costs. We will seize every opportunity for such improvement.
We are well along with the three-phase recovery plan we launched last year. The first phase, to stabilize our finances, is complete. The second phase, to improve operating performance, is well underway. Now, AES is moving into the third phase, to begin growing again through disciplined investments.

    Capitalizing on global investment opportunities will enhance future growth and value creation. In the develop- ment of these opportunities, we have consciously decided to refocus our efforts under new, dedicated leadership. In February 2004 we recruited one of our directors, Bob Hemphill, to rejoin AES to lead this effort. Bob and his very capable development team will evaluate potential investments in a disciplined manner, identify the best oppor- tunities, and pursue these with our proven development skills and responsible attention to the quality of our invest- ment portfolio.
This strategy will take maximum advantage of our global footprint and resources: transferring knowledge and best practices from country to country; scanning markets around the world to identify the most attractive investment opportunities; drawing on functional and geographic expertise; and building upon demonstrated capacities for both entrepreneurial creativity and opera- tional excellence. The combination of these factors gives us a distinct competitive advantage.
AES is moving in the right direction. We expect double-digit growth in earnings per share over the next several years, driven by sales growth, performance improvement, continued debt reduction, and new investment opportunities. And we believe earnings and cash flow growth above the broader market averages
should be a meaningful contributor to favorable stock price performance.
Thank you for the trust you have shown by investing in AES. We look forward to earning your continued support with a company that is reenergized and worthy of your continued trust.
Sincerely,
Richard Darman Chairman of the Board
