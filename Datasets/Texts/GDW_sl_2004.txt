Golden West Financial Times

From the Office of the Chairman
Golden West Financial Corporation reported the Company's best year ever in 2004, with records set for earnings, asset size, loan originations, and capital. In particular, our diluted earnings per share reached an all-time high of $4.13, a 16% increase over the previous record of $3.57 set just a year ago in 2003. Assets passed the $100 billion mark in September 2004 and ended the year at $107 billion, up 29% from the prior year. Loan originations jumped 36% from 2003, and net worth exceeded $7 billion at yearend. Additionally, Golden West produced newsworthy results in three other important areas. First, net deposit inflows of $6.2 billion were the second highest in the Company's history. Second, our loan quality measures continued to be excellent. The ratio of nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructured to total assets fell to .33% at yearend 2004, down from .51% at December 31, 2003. Plus, we recorded virtually no chargeoffs for the seventh straight year. And, third, our already low general and administrative expense ratio fell even further, dropping to .90% in 2004 from .98% for the prior year. Of course, in 2004, as in every other year, we carried out our unique business model within the context of specific market interest rates, economic conditions, and demand for home loans.

Wind Shift Causes Updraft in Short-Term Interest Rates; Long-Term Yields Hold Relatively Steady In 2004, short-term interest rates, which had reached 45-year lows in 2003, started to move up. The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee raised the Federal Funds (Fed Funds) rate five times, bringing the level to 2.25% at yearend, up 125 basis points from the 1.00% level where it had hovered since June 2003. Three-month LIBOR, a sensitive short-term interest rate to which many adjustable rate debt instruments are pegged, also increased.

Favorable Economic Currents Lead to Drop in Unemployment The benign business climate that prevailed in 2004 resulted in moderate Gross Domestic Product growth. Because of the calm atmosphere,

the unemployment rate dropped to 5.4% at yearend 2004 from the elevated level of 2003, when the jobless figures equaled or exceeded 6.0% for more than half the year.

Long-term interest rates displayed more variability than short-term yields. The Ten-Year U.S. Treasury Note rate, which has a direct bearing on the cost of traditional fixed-rate mortgages, remained near historical lows throughout the year, but fluctuated within a 120 basis point band. During the year, these yields trended down in the winter to a mid-March low, then rose in the spring to a mid-June high, before gently subsiding during the summer and fall and then turning up again at the end of the year.

25% from the all-time high $3.8 trillion set in 2003. The falloff was driven by the 50% drop in the refinance market, after the prior year's "refi mania." Partially offsetting the decline in refinance activity was the strong 2004 U.S. home sales market, which hit new highs in terms of both number sold and dollar volume of mortgages written. The climate for adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), our primary product, warmed up in 2004, with ARMs increasing as a percentage of nationwide originations,
