Fellow Shareholders:

By almost any measure, 2008 was another excellent year for Biogen Idec. We grew revenues 29 percent and non-GAAP diluted earnings 34 percent over 2007. All three of our marketed products delivered strong growth, with TYSABRI (natalizumab) exiting the year on pace to become a blockbuster. We've transformed our product pipeline over the past two years and now have 20 programs in Phase 2 clinical trials and  beyond, five potentially first-in-class or best-in-class compounds in registration  trials and another compound in registration trials from our anti-CD20 collaboration with Genentech Inc. Strategy Designed to Meet Current and Future Challenges Our achievements in 2008 flowed from the execution of our well-defined, long-term strategy, which, at its core, is focused on addressing serious unmet medical needs. This strategy anticipated an environment in which many large pharmaceutical companies would face the multiple challenges of patent expirations on major products, less than fully productive pipelines and pricing pressures in developed markets. We have long held the belief that, even in the face of such conditions, first-in-class or best-in-class therapies that change the standard of treatment for life-threatening or life-altering disease will continue to have value for patients and shareholders. We have developed  and supported such therapies through robust research and development and highly disciplined business development; by pursuing treatments for diseases that require relatively small, specialized sales forces, rather than a large sales-and-marketing infrastructure; and by expanding our presence globally to increase the diversity of our  revenue stream and maximize the value of our marketed products. In addition, while virtually no one foresaw the severity of the current challenging economic environment, our long-term strategy has emphasized the importance of  a strong balance sheet and cash flows; as of December 31, 2008, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $2.3 billion. Excellent Performance from Outstanding Products Our 2008 revenue totaled $4.1 billion, more than double the amount five years ago at the time of the merger that created Biogen Idec. These financial results were driven by the strong performance of the company's marketed products. In 2008, our global multiple sclerosis (MS) franchise reached about $2.8 billion in revenue, up 33 percent over the previous year. The franchise is anchored by AVONEX  (interferon beta-1a), the world's No. 1 prescribed therapy for MS patients. Benefiting from its long-term safety and efficacy profile, AVONEX maintained its impressive  market leadership with more than 135,000 patients on therapy worldwide at the end of 2008. TYSABRI, a therapy that has established a new level of efficacy for the treatment of MS, added more than 16,000 MS and Crohn's patients in 2008, ending the year with more than 37,000 patients on therapy. While TYSABRI's launch trajectory is on par with some of the industry's biggest blockbusters, the pace of growth slowed in the second half of the year as prescribers assimilated news of the first cases of a rare brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, in TYSABRI patients since the drug's U.S. reintroduction and European launch in July 2006. We continue to actively look for ways to identify patients at risk of PML, improve early detection and treat the brain infection. Meanwhile, sales have stabilized, and we are now focused on regaining TYSABRI's momentum. We continue to believe that 100,000 patients on TYSABRI is an appropriate goal and that it is a matter of when ­ not if ­ we achieve that goal. This belief is based on the compelling efficacy profile of TYSABRI ­ the first MS drug ever to demonstrate an  improvement in physical function for some patients with this debilitating disease.

Great companies are built on outstanding people, products, pipeline and performance ­ Biogen Idec is delivering on all fronts.

Importantly, as we proceed through 2009, we are redoubling our efforts to focus prescribers on TYSABRI's unprecedented efficacy. The long-term experience with TYSABRI continues to grow and will provide the medical community with greater clarity regarding the product's safety and efficacy profile over longer periods of time. RITUXAN (rituximab), a treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) that Biogen Idec discovered, developed and co-promotes in the U.S. with Genentech, continues to build on its  success. This product, which, like AVONEX, has for years ranked among the top 10 biotechnology products, is expanding within autoimmune diseases and potentially other new indications. Data from two Phase 3 studies in RA patients presented last year support the potential use of RITUXAN earlier in the course of treatment for this debilitating disease. Separately, we and our partners plan to file for approval to market RITUXAN in another difficult to treat  cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), based on data showing that RITUXAN plus chemotherapy significantly increased the time patients lived without their disease advancing, compared to chemotherapy alone. Broad and Deep Pipeline In 2008, we advanced a number of pipeline programs, further strengthening one of the most robust pipelines in the industry. We delivered 11 data readouts that allowed the company to make critical clinical development decisions. We started five programs in human clinical  trials and transitioned six programs from research to development status. The strengthening of Biogen Idec's product pipeline over the past two years is the result of organic R&D and highly disciplined business development. In 2008, to support the continued advancement of the pipeline, the  company invested more than $1 billion in R&D, representing approximately 26 percent of the company's  full-year revenues. In total, we now have more than 60 clinical trials ongoing in 15 indications across neurology, oncology, immunology, cardiology and hemophilia; and more than 35 preclinical and discovery research programs. In both breadth and depth, our pipeline rivals those of our peers as well as companies substantially larger than Biogen Idec. Strong and Experienced Board Our Board has a strong track record of serving the best interest of shareholders. In 2008, our independent directors met with investors on a number of occasions. We were also pleased to appoint three new strong,

independent directors to our Board: Nancy L. Leaming, Stelios Papadopoulos, Ph.D., and Brian S. Posner. These individuals bring business, investment and leadership experience that further strengthens our Board and best positions us to drive value for the company's  shareholders in the years ahead. Looking Ahead to 2010 On nearly every front, we are making significant progress against the 2010 goals we set for the company in late 2007. Our 29 percent revenue growth and 34 percent non-GAAP diluted EPS growth put Biogen Idec solidly on track to generate 15 percent revenue and 20 percent non-GAAP diluted EPS growth compounded annually from 2004 through 2010. AVONEX continued its record of solid performance. Based on the positive data in RA, we and Genentech plan to file for approval to expand RITUXAN's use against this debilitating autoimmune disease. Although our progress toward 100,000 patients on TYSABRI slowed, we believe that TYSABRI will one day be the leading  treatment for MS because of its unparalleled efficacy. We made solid gains toward launching four new  products and/or existing products in new indications with TYSABRI's approval in Crohn's disease and plans to file for RITUXAN's expanded use in RA and CLL. We have five registration trials underway, a sixth from our antiCD20 collaboration and a seventh set to start mid year, putting us on track to meet our late-stage development goal well ahead of schedule. With 33 percent of revenues from our International business, we're also on our way to achieving our goal  of more than 40 percent of revenues coming from ex-U.S. sales. Great companies are built on outstanding people, products,   pipeline and performance ­ Biogen Idec is delivering on all fronts. Although we will, like virtually all  businesses in the current environment, face  headwinds in 2009, our fundamentals are strong and we are  confident in our ability to continue to deliver outstanding results and create value for our shareholders. We thank you for your support.
