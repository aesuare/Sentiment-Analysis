he 2005 edition of the Golden West Financial Times contains several newsworthy articles that discuss our continued ability to produce high returns through careful execution of our riskaverse strategy. Four major 2005 records highlight

the year's outcomes that contribute to our undisputed special situation status:  Diluted earnings per share amounted to $4.77, a 15% increase over the previous all-time high of $4.13 set in 2004.

 Loan origination volume reached $51.5 billion, or 5% higher than the prior record of $49.0 billion in 2004.  Savings deposits expanded by $7.2 billion, exceeding the prior all-time high of $6.6 billion set in 2002, and 15% more than 2004's $6.2 billion increase.  Capital passed the $8.5 billion level for the first time in the Company's history. Golden West's 2005 story also includes several other significant accomplishments. Loan quality measures continued to be excellent: The ratio of nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructured to total assets fell to a nominal .31%, down from the already low .33% at December 31, 2004, and we recorded virtually no loan losses for the eighth year in a row. We also reported exceptional general and administrative (G&A) results, with the ratio of G&A to average assets declining to a mere .82%, the lowest level in 25 years. Even though it almost goes without saying, we must pay tribute to the Company's dedicated and talented employees who contributed to these successes in 2005. Every year seems to have a unique operating environment, and 2005 proved to be no exception. The "Weather Report" which follows contains important background information on the interest rate, economic, and mortgage market conditions we encountered as we executed our risk-averse strategy in 2005.

result, Fed Funds moved from the very low level of 1.00% in mid-2004 to 2.25% at December 31, 2004, reaching 4.25% by December 31, 2005. These increases in the Fed Funds rate led to significantly higher yields on short-term instruments. Long-Term Rates Encounter Headwinds Over the same time period, long-term yields, determined primarily by investor expectations about inflation and worldwide demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, were almost becalmed. As illustrated in the accompanying graph, the Ten-Year U.S. Treasury Note, which heavily influences the cost of traditional fixed-rate mortgages, fluctuated narrowly in a tight band between 3.89% and 4.66% over the past 18 months, ending 2005 at 4.39%.

Weather Report
Pattern of Rising Short-Term Interest Rates Short-term interest rates, which started to rise in the middle of 2004, continued to climb throughout 2005. In a flurry of activity, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) hiked the Federal Funds (Fed Funds) rate five times in the second half of 2004 and eight in 2005. As a

Atmospheric Pressure Flattens Yield Curve The graph below shows yields on U.S. Treasury instruments with terms to maturity ranging from three months to ten years, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004, and 2005. Each line represents a "yield curve," which charts returns based on the term to maturity.

Economic Conditions Mainly Pleasant and Mild, With a Few Scattered Clouds The business climate in 2005 was benign, with the lowest unemployment rate since 2001 and moderate growth of the Gross Domestic Product. In the last quarter of the year, however, clouds began to form due to surging energy prices, an historically high trade deficit, and a continued large federal deficit, all of which contributed to concern about future inflationary pressures.

In a normal or upwardly sloped yield curve, rates on short-term obligations, such as U.S. Treasury Bills, are typically well below yields on long-term bonds, because investors require compensation in the form of a higher return for the interest rate risk of holding fixed-rate instruments for extended periods. From time to time, this expected pattern is interrupted, and the yield curve becomes relatively flat, meaning that short- and long-term securities offer virtually equivalent yields. In 2005, short-term rates rose sharply while long-term yields were comparatively static, resulting in a yield curve with little positive slope.

adjustable rate mortgages also changed during 2005. Specifically, rising ARM rates diminished the advantage adjustables enjoyed over fixedrate mortgages during the past few years, and, as a result, ARMs captured a smaller share of the overall market.

National Mortgage Market Temperature Rises, Then Falls While the total nationwide market for one- to four-family mortgage originations in 2005 was similar to the robust level of the prior year, the pattern of home loan demand differed. By way of background, mortgage originations are usually seasonal, with the largest volumes produced in the warm weather of the second and third quarters. During the hot mortgage market in 2004, however, demand remained high into the final three months, setting up favorable conditions that continued well into 2005. As the year came to a close, rising interest rates dampened mortgage demand, leading to a cooling off of the home loan market. The interest rate climate for
