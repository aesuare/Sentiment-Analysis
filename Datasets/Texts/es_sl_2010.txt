2010 ANNUAL REPORT

a message from the chairman

For Northeast Utilities (NU), 2010 was a year of significant achievement as we continued to successfully execute our strategic plan. Our performance has again demonstrated the strength of our strategy and our ability to excel under even the most challenging economic conditions. Shouldering the responsibility of leadership, we delivered reliable, responsive service to customers and solid results to shareholders.

our proposed merger with NSTAR will create a premier regional energy company serving nearly 3.5 million customers in three states

To Our Shareholders: Appropriately, we capped a year of achievement with the next step in the evolution of NU. On October 18, 2010, we announced plans to merge with the Bostonarea electric and gas utility, NSTAR. This transaction is a natural fit of two companies with adjacent geographic footprints and similar strategic goals. It will create a premier regional energy company serving nearly 3.5 million customers in three states. Once the merger is complete, we will provide electricity and natural gas to over half of the energy customers in New England. Simply put, this combination provides a better platform for us to deliver on our promise for future growth than we would have been able to achieve on a standalone basis. Our shareholders and NSTAR shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger on March 4, and we expect to secure the necessary approvals to complete this transaction in the second half of 2011. Solid financial results For our shareholders, we delivered improved financial performance for the year with our continued control over costs, strong operating results in all of our segments, and by strategically deploying capital for transmission and distribution investments. In 2010, we delivered earnings per share of $2.19, compared with $1.91 per share in 2009. Company earnings totaled $387.9 million in 2010, compared with $330.0 million in 2009. In an economic environment that saw many companies cut dividends, we increased our dividend at a faster pace than the utility industry average. We raised our dividend in early 2010 from an annualized rate of $0.95 per share to $1.025 per share. In the first quarter of 2011, we raised the dividend again to an annualized rate of $1.10 per share. This was the eleventh consecutive year we increased our dividend. Our total shareholder return during 2010 was 28.3 percent, including our dividend.

In fact, our total return was the highest of all similar companies in the Edison Electric Institute's Index of Shareholder-Owned Electric Utilities for five years ended September 30, 2010. Operational excellence Within our operations, employees of NU and its companies in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire kept the lights on and the gas flowing by delivering excellent performance in 2010. We delivered greater certainty for our customers and shareholders by successfully completing multiple-year rate cases for The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) and Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECo).

And we delivered on our promise of value for Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas) customers with a capital plan that has reduced supply constraints and enhanced safety and reliability. We invested $1 billion to further upgrade, strengthen and modernize our energy distribution and transmission systems. Over the next five years, we expect to invest an additional $6.6 billion in New England's energy infrastructure. In 2010, we completed or advanced several major infrastructure projects on time, on budget and safely, once again demonstrating a level of operational excellence and responsibility that sets us apart.

In Connecticut, we completed approximately 10 miles of our 16-mile Yankee Gas pipeline expansion between Wallingford and Waterbury. The project will supplement our supply portfolio, ensure we can meet our growing peak demand and will enable the retirement of aged propane peaking facilities. One segment was placed in service in 2010, and we anticipate the entire project will be completed in time for the 2011-2012 winter heating season. Another major project, the New England EastWest Solutions (NEEWS) family of transmission projects will improve regional reliability by providing a strong transmission connection for the flow of power throughout southern New England. The largest of the NEEWS projects, the Greater Springfield Reliability Project, received siting approvals from Massachusetts and Connecticut in 2010. Construction began at the end of 2010 with a projected late-2013 completion date. In addition, ISO-New England reaffirmed the need for the Interstate Reliability Project in August 2010. The last of the NEEWS projects ­ the Central Connecticut Reliability Project ­ remains within

ISO-New England's regional system plan while it continues its review to determine when it will be needed. These infrastructure investments enable us to strengthen the reliability of our system and increase our ability to add renewable energy to the region. Advancing clean energy solutions By reducing emissions, adding renewable energy options and working with customers to conserve energy, we envision a cleaner energy future for New England. In 2010, we established ourselves as a regional and national leader in clean, renewable energy and alternative technologies while supporting the legislative goals of our states. Additionally, we continued our record of success in delivering innovative, forward-looking transmission solutions for the energy issues challenging our region. In 2010, we successfully reached key milestones for the Northern Pass project, a high-voltage, direct-current transmission line that will bring 1,200 megawatts of low-carbon, primarily

hydro-electric, power from Canada to New England's load centers. We made significant progress finalizing and completing a series of agreements for the project, in partnership with NSTAR and Hydro-Québec, and made key regulatory filings with the U.S. Department of Energy and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). On February 11, 2011, FERC approved the Transmission Service Agreement as uniquely beneficial to our region. Community outreach for the project began following the public announcement of the converter terminal location in Franklin, New Hampshire. Although it is contingent on siting approvals, construction of the line should begin in 2013. By 2015, we expect it to begin delivering power into New England.

Construction of the Springfield facility will complete the initial 6-megawatt authorization WMECo received from the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities in 2009. In New Hampshire, construction on the Clean Air Project at PSNH's Merrimack Generating Station is 82 percent complete and continues to be ahead of schedule and under budget. When the project is completed in 2012, the power plant will be one of the nation's cleanest coalburning energy facilities. This project will use wet-flue gas desulfurization technology. It will dramatically reduce mercury and sulfur dioxide emissions from Merrimack's two units, and Merrimack will continue to provide the region with competitively priced energy and needed fuel diversity. In 2010, we continued to examine the emerging industry of plug-in electric vehicles as an opportunity to provide our customers with a clean, lower-cost fuel alternative and to help spur the region's economy. Ongoing research projects include the installation and testing of electric vehicle charging equipment at NU facilities in Hartford and Berlin, Connecticut. In addition, CL&P and WMECo are partnering with interested municipalities and business customers to install about two dozen charging stations in Connecticut and western Massachusetts. These New England states will be among the first in the nation to sell the dual-fuel Chevy Volt and the all-electric Nissan Leaf, as a result of our early, proactive collaboration with automakers and state and local policy leaders. Innovative customer solutions Working with our customers to help them conserve energy and manage its use demonstrates another powerful way that NU leads the effort to ensure a clean energy future. In fact, our foresight in energy efficiency has enabled us to lead this worthwhile effort both regionally and nationally for more than three decades.

In another development that speaks to our overall leadership, we embarked on the construction of largescale solar generation in Massachusetts. In October 2010, WMECo completed its first facility in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where it installed 1.8 megawatts of solar generation. Completed in just six months, the project shines as the region's largest solar installation to date. WMECo recently announced selection of the second site for development of a 4.2 megawatt facility on a 62-acre capped landfill in Springfield, Massachusetts.

Energy efficiency is also more critical than ever in these trying economic times. When our customers save energy, it benefits them financially and is good for the environment. Throughout Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, we give our customers the tools to better manage their energy use and reduce costs. In 2010, we partnered with our customers to achieve landmark energy efficiency savings. For example, in Connecticut, nearly 700,000 CL&P and Yankee Gas customers participated in an energy efficiency program or rebate offer sponsored by the Connecticut Energy Efficiency Fund. As a result, these customers saved more than $51 million in energy costs, while tons of carbon dioxide emissions were avoided. NU received national recognition for continuing its legacy of leadership in energy efficiency and the advancement of technology to best serve our customers. We were among Intelligent Utility magazine's annual ranking of the nation's top 25 electric utilities based on our commitment to renewable energy, energy efficiency and our investments in smart grid technology. In addition, our electric operating companies received the

Environmental Protection Agency's 2010 ENERGY STAR® Sustained Excellence Award as part of the Northeast Retail Products Initiative. Our region is our home Across the NU family of companies, whether in Connecticut, western Massachusetts or New Hampshire, we live where we work and we take seriously our responsibility to be good neighbors. The spirit of service has always been reflected in our employees' commitment to donating their time to volunteer work. Last year, they gave a record number of hours at company-sponsored opportunities to support various causes in our communities.

NU employees also contribute financially, in particular through the company's annual employee giving campaign to benefit the United Way. The results of our 2010 campaign once again highlight our long-standing commitment to helping others in need, as exemplified by our total donation of over $1.5 million. Our collective pledges exceeded our $1.1 million campaign pledge goal and reflect NU's exceptional generosity. Equally impressive was the support of our Day of Caring activities; more than 1,100 NU employees worked on-location at over 40 community sites.

have been possible without the talented men and women of NU. Our employees are the heart of NU's achievements that earned us nationwide recognition in 2010 with many awards reflecting our commitment to improving the lives of our customers and supporting technological progress for our industry. Always looking ahead, we will remain focused on achieving our financial goals and delivering value for you. We will also continue to work hard to sustain operational excellence and honor our environmental and community commitments to continue to deliver industry-leading performance for our customers. No one championed these commitments more than Dr. E. Gail dePlanque, a member of the NU Board of Trustees for 15 years. We were greatly saddened by Gail's death in 2010, and she will be missed by her colleagues here at NU. Finally, I look forward to the successful completion of our merger with NSTAR. This last chapter remains to be written, but I am confident it will allow us to be better positioned to deliver on our promise of leadership and growth for years to come. Thank you for your continued support and confidence as we work to achieve future success. Sincerely,

In addition, our operating companies and the Northeast Utilities Foundation provided $4.7 million in grants to nonprofit organizations and worthwhile regional activities across our tri-state service area in 2010. Positioning NU for the future 2010 was a unique and remarkable year for NU with considerable accomplishments for our customers and shareholders. Of course, none of this would
