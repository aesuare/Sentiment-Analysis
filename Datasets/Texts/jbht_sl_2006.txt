                 TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:
Our financial results for the calendar year 2006 represented the fifth consecutive year of record revenues and earnings for J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. Our 2006 consolidated operating ratio (operating expenses divided by total operating revenues) was 88.8%, the third consecutive time we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 90%. More importantly, our steadfast dedication and cultural commitment to SAFETY and customer service enabled us to accomplish these results in a safe and reliable manner. Our family of more than 17,000 transportation professionals rose above economic barriers, particularly in the Truck segment, to produce some very impressive statistics when comparing 2006 vs. 2005:
• Annual revenues increased 6% to a record $3.3 billion • Operating income rose 8% to $373 million
• Net earnings increased 6% to a record $220 million
• Earnings per share improved by more than 12%
• Return on invested capital was 21%, at the top of the asset-based transportation industry • Dividend yield to our stockholders increased to 1.3%
• Truck fleet grew to 12,127 units
• Container and trailer fleets grew to 27,622 and 25,727, respectively
We managed to successfully continue diversification toward our “shore to door” approach to the supply chain challenges in North America and to post another record performance. This was due, in no small part, to our highly diversified services portfolio. Revenue derived from nontraditional truckload services increased by more than 10% to $2.32 billion, or roughly 70% of our total annual revenues. Our Intermodal segment, which represented 43% of our 2006 revenue and 49% of our operating income, generated a record $1.43 billion in revenue, an 11% increase over the previous year as more shippers turned to our time-tested and service-sensitive Intermodal franchise. The Dedicated Contract Services (DCS) segment also experienced steady growth as customers continued to demand our value-added solutions for specialized transportation. This best-in-class combination of services allowed us to offset declines in the Truck segment as we battled the impact of economic headwinds and a drop-off in demand.
Moving forward, our resolve has never been stronger. We believe our diversified business model, fueled by our proprietary Customer Value Delivery® methodology, will continue to generate a more attractive offering for our customers while providing an improved return for our shareholders. Our industry-leading operational excellence, award-winning service and technology, and unwavering focus on SAFETY will continue to drive our Company in everything we do.
We thank you for your continued support and interest in J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.
