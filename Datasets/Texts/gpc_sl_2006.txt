 To our Shareholders
We are pleased to report that Genuine Parts Company achieved another record level of sales and earnings in 2006.
Total sales for 2006 rose to $10.5 billion, an increase of 7% com- pared to 2005, and our first year to surpass the $10 billion revenue milestone. This is a significant achievement for the GPC team! Our progress in 2006 follows 8% increases in revenues in both 2004 and 2005 and we remain encouraged by the positive trend in total sales growth for the Company. Net earnings for the year were $475 million, an increase of 9% compared to 2005, and earnings per share were $2.76, up 10%. 2006 represents our third consecutive year of double-digit growth in earnings per share.
With another record year behind us, we have now increased sales in 56 of the last 57 years and increased profits in 44 of the last 46 years. We are proud of this record and we feel that it reflects our unending com- mitment to steady and consistent growth at Genuine Parts Company.
Financial Strength
Ongoing asset management initiatives and the continued generation of consistent and strong cash flows helped to further strengthen our financial condition in 2006. Our year-end ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 3.2 to 1 and working capital as a percentage of sales improved for the third consecutive year to 25%. Cash flow from operations was consistent with last year at $434 million and, after deducting dividends and capital expenditures, we generated positive free cash flow of $79 million. At December 31, 2006, our total debt was $500 million, which was unchanged from the prior year.
During 2006, we used our cash to repurchase 2.9 million shares of our Company stock. We continue to view this as a good use of cash and, at our August 2006 Board meeting, our Directors authorized an additional 15 million shares for repurchase. As of December 31, 2006, we have 15.3 million shares available for repurchase under our current program. We will continue to make opportunistic share repurchases in 2007. We also invested $126 million in capital expen- ditures in our businesses and we returned $228 million to shareholders through dividends paid in 2006.
of increases. The Board of Directors, at its meeting on February 19, 2007, raised the cash dividend payable April 2, 2007 by 8% to an annual rate of $1.46 per share, or 53% of our 2006 earnings. 2007 will be our 51st consecutive year of increased dividends paid to our shareholders.
Progress In Operations
Again in 2006, each of our four business segments contributed to our overall progress for the year. Motion Industries, our Industrial Distribution company, reported very strong results, with its sales increasing 11% for the third consecutive year. Looking ahead to 2007, the outlook for the industrial markets served by Motion is promising. The manufacturing sector of the economy, as measured by the Industrial Production and Manufacturer Capacity Utilization indices, remains healthy and customer demand is likely to provide us further growth opportunities. EIS, our Electrical/Electronic segment, also benefited from the strength in the manufacturing sector and, in 2006, reported a 20% increase in sales for the year. We expect 2007 to be another good year for EIS.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products company, improved sales by 7% for the year, and this follows an 8% increase in sales in 2005. The Office Products Group generates consistent and steady results and we are encouraged by its performance in 2006. This year’s solid progress reflects our product and customer expansion efforts and the continued development of effective marketing programs and dealer services. In 2007, we expect these initiatives, combined with the ongoing growth in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and white-collar employment, to drive additional progress for the Office Products Group.
The Automotive Parts Group, our largest business group, increased sales by 3% in 2006, following 6% increases in 2004 and 2005. Core NAPA operations, which excludes our Johnson Industries subsidiary, improved revenues by 5%, so the progress made in our ongoing Automotive operations was somewhat offset by our decision in 2005 to downsize the operations at Johnson Industries. We continue to believe this was the right decision for the Company. Looking ahead, we expect our Automotive growth initiatives to position the group for solid progress in 2007 and beyond. In addition, market factors such as total vehicles on the road, the age and mix of the vehicles and miles driven, remain positive for the industry and they create excellent growth opportunities for the Automotive Parts Group.
GPC Directors
The GPC Board, at its meeting in November 2006, elected George C. “Jack” Guynn as a new Director. Mr. Guynn is the retired President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Jack is an experienced and successful executive and we are pleased to have him joining our Board. We look forward to his contributions in the years ahead. We are asking the shareholders to elect Jack, along with all other Directors, at the April 23, 2007 Shareholders’ Meeting.
Management
During 2006, there were a number of management changes and promotions that we would like to share with you. G. Thomas Braswell, our Senior Vice President – Information Technology, retired from the Company in February 2007. Tom’s impressive career at Genuine Parts Company spans over 40 years and the Company has benefited greatly
