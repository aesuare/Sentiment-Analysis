redevelopment project, which is scheduled for completion in september 2015. Upon its reopening, the hotel will be operated by Kokua Hospitality as the axiom hotel. Our property in miami, renamed the yVe Hotel miami, is managed by Destination Hotels & Resorts.
3 Our joint venture in europe expanded its footprint across key european markets by acquiring and rebranding the sheraton Berlin Grand Hotel esplanade for €81 million in september. the joint venture now owns 19 properties in nine countries with total assets of approximately €2 billion;
3 We completed the development of the 131-unit Hyatt Ka’anapali Beach, a Hyatt Residence club, adjacent to our Hyatt Regency maui Resort & spa. We contributed a combination of excess land and cash for a 67% interest in the joint venture that owns the timeshare project, which recognized $54 million in sales in 2014.
3 We completed the development of the 149-room novotel and the 256-room ibis Rio de Janeiro parque Olimpico in Barra da tijuca for $65 million. Operated by accor, these properties are ideally situated for guests attending the 2016 Olympic Games, as well as providing access to local retail and business districts;
3 In november, we activated the new 25,000 square foot, eight-story tall high-definition digital billboard at the new york marriott marquis, which was developed in conjunction with the redevelopment and lease of the retail space to Vornado Realty trust. the approximately 45,000 square feet of retail space facing Broadway on times square is expected to be fully leased in late 2015;
3 We took advantage of flexibility in our management agree- ments to engage sage Hospitality to operate the Four seasons Hotel philadelphia and the Denver tech marriott;
3 We were able to take advantage of attractive pricing to dispose of five non-core properties for approximately $515 million. these transactions reduced our exposure to markets where we believe long-term growth is constrained and our return on investment is lower; and
3 We repaid $760 million of debt and lowered our leverage ratio, as measured by debt-to-eBItDa, by 60 basis points, the lowest in company history.
We believe lodging fundamentals will remain strong in 2015, helping to drive another solid year of growth in our portfolio. We will invest approximately $250 million in rede- velopment, return on investment and value enhancement projects, which we believe will create long-term value, but will impact short-term performance. We have remained focused on our goal to be the premier lodging real estate company, continually refining our strategy to adapt to changes in the lodging real estate industry. We believe our efforts to drive operating performance and well-considered investments will create real growth in stockholder value. We are convinced that our combination of iconic assets, financial strength, and management expertise creates an attractive opportunity for investors. We appreciate your support.

 Our long-term growth is
based on a well-integrated
asset management team that
drives operating profit, while
practicing disciplined capital allocation with initiatives that create value for our existing portfolio. Our strength is rooted in an investment grade balance sheet with a flexible capital structure that fosters external growth throughout the business cycle. the result of our efforts is clear, measurable growth in operating profits, dividends and stockholder value.
Our 2014 operating performance marked the fifth straight year of strong increase in comparable RevpaR, with growth of 5.7% on a constant dollar basis. Our performance was driven by strong demand resulting in a 77% average occupancy level, which helped our operators drive rate increases in both our transient and group segments. these top-line results were combined with cost-cutting initiatives that led to yet another year of strong margin improvement. some of the other highlights for 2014 include:
3 a 63% increase in our dividend over 2013. In 2014, we declared over $565 million in dividends, or $0.75 per share, including a $0.06 special dividend in the fourth quarter. On February 19, 2015, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and are committed to sustaining this meaningful dividend;
