During the year the Company launched TYGACILTM, a hospital injectable antibiotic for life threatening infections such as complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated skin and skin structure infections. The Consumer Health Care division launched a line extension of its product Anne French in the form of the 25 gm tube pack, during the year under review. This initiative has been well received by the consumers and the trade. To enhance the brand image of Anne French, the leading film star, Kareena Kapoor has been signed on as Brand Ambassador. Excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses/(income) from the profits of the previous year, the profit for the year at Rs. 117.76 crores represents a growth of 9.67% over previous year. OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS, RISKS AND CONCERNS The Indian Pharmaceutical market is expected to grow by 12-14% in the coming years and is also expected to expand to rural areas. Increase in price control by Government in pharmaceuticals will adversely impact the industry. High oil prices and rising inflation are adversely affecting all sectors of the economy including pharmaceuticals. Litigation under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 1979 ­ DMCTC The Company had in 1981 disputed the price fixation by the Government of India under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order, 1979, in respect of De-Methyl-Chlor-Tetracycline Hydrochloride (DMCTC HCL) formulations for the period 1981 to 1987. This matter was challenged by the Company in the Courts. The Supreme Court Order of April 1987 in this matter upheld the Government's right to fix prices. However, the Government was directed to review the prices fixed with the Company. Subsequently, the Government appointed various Committees to consider the matter. In 1994, the Government appointed a Three Member Committee to conduct this review. The Company had several hearings before the Committee from 1994 to 1998. The Government of India has now raised a demand aggregating Rs. 4407.07 lakhs comprising principal amount of Rs. 1320.52 lakhs (a sum of Rs. 100.00 lakhs has been deposited earlier) and interest up to 2nd November, 2007, Rs. 3186.55 lakhs. The Government called upon the Company to deposit the aforesaid demand together with interest into the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account (DPEA). The Company filed a Writ Petition in the Bombay High Court disputing the said demand and interest. Pending disposal of the Writ Petition, the Bombay High Court has granted a stay on the recovery of interest subject to deposit of the principal amount with the Prothonotary & Senior Master of the Bombay High Court and furnishing of security for the interest. Based on legal advice, the Company will file an appeal in the Supreme Court against the Bombay High Court Order. OUTLOOK The Company continues to invest in all the key brands to increase sales and also takes initiatives to reduce cost with a view to improving profitability and thus increase stakeholder value.
