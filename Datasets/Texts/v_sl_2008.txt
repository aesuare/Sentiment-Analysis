Letter to Our Shareholders

Joseph W. Saunders Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Visa Inc.

By any measure, 2008 was momentous for Visa. It was a year when, in spite of the extraordinarily diffi ficult economic climate, we executed a historic initial public offering. This was a milestone that marked the successful completion of our corporate reorganization and transition to a global public company -- Visa Inc.
I am pleased to report that in fiscal fi year 2008, Visa Inc. recorded excellent results:  Adjusted net income was US$1.7 billion  Net operating revenue was US$6.3 billion  Total volume on 1.6 billion cards was US$4.2 trillion, a 20 percent increase over the prior year Visa's strong performance in 2008 reflects fl a number of factors. First, our business -- electronic payments -- has shown resiliency even in the midst of the current global economic turbulence. More consumers, businesses and governments are shifting spending to electronic payments, away from cash and checks, to take advantage of the convenience, reliability and security Visa offers. This is one reason that payments volume has grown across our core business -- credit, debit and commercial products -- and in all regions in which Visa operates. Our performance underscores the strength of Visa's network business model and our ability to capitalize on the secular shift to electronic payments. Second, I am particularly pleased by and appreciative of the continued support of our financial institution clients, who are driving the growth of our network of cardholders, merchants and businesses worldwide. Our relationship with these vitally important stakeholders has grown stronger in the past 12 months, as evidenced by the number of financial fi institutions globally that have chosen to partner with Visa.

What I hear from my conversations with these clients is clear -- they are extremely concerned about the global economic crisis and are looking to areas of their business that can continue to deliver profitable fi growth. As we seek to expand Visa globally in 2009, we are mindful that our products and services are engines of growth and profitability fi for our clients, many of whom are facing increased financial strain. Therefore, as a global public company, we have committed ourselves to building a more client-centric culture and upgrading our sales organization to better serve our financial institutions' rapidly evolving needs. As someone who spent many years at fi Visa card-issuing banks, I recognize that our clients' success drives Visa's success.

DRIVING OUR CORE BUSINESS
Our core business -- credit, debit and commercial -- grew signifi ficantly during 2008. Our credit volume saw an increase of nearly 16 percent, to US$2.0 trillion, and debit continues to lead the migration from cash and checks, with payments volume of US$918 billion, an increase of 18 percent. In addition, international and cross-border debit and credit volume grew during the year. We believe that, despite the global economic turmoil, the rise of the middle class in developing economies around the world will provide us with long-term opportunities in this area. As we entered the 2009 fiscal year, we announced the creation of Visa Processing Service, a joint venture with Yalamanchili Software Exports (P) Limited that is enabling Visa to quickly and cost-effectively extend our issuer processing capabilities into new geographies. VPS complements Visa's Debit Processing Service in the U.S., offering

our international clients access to Visa's industry-leading processing and value-added services in some of the fastest-growing payments regions in the world. These include Brazil, India, Russia, and Gulf region countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Visa's leadership in debit has been a pillar of our performance as we continue to capture a greater share of everyday spending from cash and checks, particularly in the U.S. In 2008, we signed an expanded agreement with HSBC to become its exclusive debit partner in 20 countries and territories across Asia Pacific fi and the Middle East. We also signed a global debit agreement with Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC. As part of the agreement, RBS and its subsidiaries, including Citizens Financial Group in the U.S., will convert their entire debit portfolio to Visa. These business wins speak not only to the strength of our debit business but also to our superior approach to client service. In fiscal 2009, debit remains an integral part of Visa's long-term growth strategy as we help our financial fi institution partners build stronger relationships with their customers. At the same time, we believe that credit, particularly in key developing economies, has a long way to go before it reaches its full potential. Visa, with our leadership in credit, is particularly well positioned to take advantage of this trend when the global economic recovery begins in earnest.

PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE
Earlier this decade, Visa set out to map the future of the organization in an increasingly competitive world. It became clear to everyone that unlocking Visa's full potential would require a reorganization of unparalleled scope. We believed that by combining five of our geographic regions into one publicly traded company, Visa and our stakeholders would be better positioned to capture a greater share of consumer and business spending.
A revolutionary credit device, the BankAmericard.

T HE F IRST 50 Y EARS
Fifty y years ago, a quiet revolution started d in Fresno, Calif. The first fi BankAmericards were issued d there to 60,000 consumers, forever r changing the dynamics of f commerce and d challenging the dominance of f cash and d checks. More than a decade after r its launch, the BankAmericard program stood d at a crossroads. While the card's growth was impressive, it was losing ground d to new w competitors. Fortunately y for r Visa, Dee Hock k stepped d in and d took k the BankAmericard d in a new w direction that helped d drive the organization and d the entire industry y forward.

Hock k had d a vision for r our r industry y that went way y beyond offering revolving credit to a small group of f consumers for use at a select group of f retailers. He believed d that Visa could transform how w we pay y for r everything by y replacing existing payment types with "digital currency." " His relentless drive toward d the future propelled d Visa to introduce the world's first fi debit card d in 1975. We extended d Hock's vision in the 1990s with a clear r strategy y that has helped d us lead d this important category y across all our r major r geographies. The passion he inspired d became part of f Visa's DNA and was the catalyst for r countless other r innovations that have improved d the payment experience for r more than a billion people worldwide. It spurred d our r push to help our r clients

Our performance since the reorganization in 2007 and the IPO last March suggests we are on the right path.  We have assembled a world-class management team that combines extensive payment expertise with significant fi experience running publicly-traded companies.  We have assembled a majority-independent board of directors that provides us with broad experience across the financial industry, strong guidance and independent voices to ensure Visa remains resilient and responsive.  We have enhanced our global client service capabilities. fi operational changes in order to maximize effi ficiencies,  We have made significant lower our costs, lower our tax rate and take a global view of investing our resources for maximum return to our clients and our business.  We have embraced our role as a responsible corporate citizen by launching a robust corporate responsibility program aligned with our business strategy and expertise.  We have continued to grow our share of electronic payments, migrating more spend away from cash and checks through our core debit and credit products. In 2007, 18 percent of personal consumption expenditure worldwide was conducted on a Visa card, compared with 11 percent in 2001.  We have now resolved all outstanding disputes with our major competitors -- MasterCard, American Express, First Data and Discover -- which allows us to focus our attention on the future. In November 2007, we settled litigation with American Express that had been pending since 2004. In October 2008, we resolved our dispute with Discover Financial Services. I am particularly pleased that these settlements were funded pursuant to our retrospective responsibility plan, with little impact to Visa's shareholders. In return for a contribution to the Discover settlement, Visa also obtained a full release for unasserted claims by MasterCard.

EMPOWERING PEOPLE, BUILDING ECONOMIES
Our ability to grow our business during each of the past 50 years illustrates the value our products bring to every participant in our network. The street vendor in Brazil who recently began accepting Visa saw his sales increase by 20 percent. The businessman in Mumbai, India, who uses Visa Money Transfer can now send money securely to his mother in Calcutta from his Visa account to her account in a matter of seconds via the Internet. And the woman in Indiana who receives her benefits fi payment on a Visa prepaid card is now freed from the hassle, cost and disruption of traveling to a check-cashing facility. Now she can use her Visa prepaid card at any of the 29 million-plus merchant outlets and more than 1.4 million ATMs worldwide that accept our products. As we grow our business globally, it is worth pausing to acknowledge the value we can bring to individuals, businesses and governments by simply providing them with access to secure, convenient and reliable payment products and reducing their reliance on cash and checks. This echoes Visa's original vision of providing people with a better way to pay and be paid.
The Olympic Games in Beijing provided Visa with the opportunity to reach a huge global audience and undertake programs that benefit fi our business while also providing value to a diverse group of stakeholders.

LOOKING FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE
Despite the economic turbulence we face today, I remain optimistic about Visa's future. While we have enjoyed tremendous success and growth over the past 50 years, electronic payments account for a relatively small percentage of global consumer and business spending. Few industries of our standing enjoy that kind of potential -- and even fewer companies have the strengths Visa has to take full advantage of it. Consider that, in most markets in which we operate, cash and checks represent more than 50 percent of personal consumption expenditure. This is particularly true in many of the developing parts of the world. As those regions grow as a result of rising incomes, globalization of commerce and increased travel, so too will their need for full participation in the global economy. Electronic payments can meet that need. Our most important task at Visa will be to connect these consumers and businesses to our global network of cardholders, merchants and financial fi institutions.

At Visa, we are not relying on organic growth. We are pushing forward aggressively with strategic initiatives that will accelerate our business and the entire industry. First, we are seeking to globalize our debit offerings to replicate the leadership we have enjoyed in the U.S. for many years. At the same time, we are looking to capture a greater share of this growth on our network by improving our local processing activities in key markets. We recognize that in a network business, increasing the size and activity of each stakeholder group is critical. For that reason, we are seeking to expand acceptance globally and increase usage at the point of sale by delivering demonstrably better value than any other payment alternative.

I NNOVATING

FOR THE

F UTURE

In the 50 years since the introduction of f the BankAmericard, Visa has grown to become the world's largest payment network and d brand, processing $4.2 trillion on 1.6 billion Visa cards in more than 170 countries.

This infrastructure underpins Visa's current innovation initiatives such as prepaid, mobile and money y transfer, in addition to our r core credit, debit and commercial products.

In September, Visa announced plans to make payment-related services available on the Android platform. The first fi Visa services delivered d through Android d will allow w T-Mobile customers with Chase Visa accounts to receive notifications fi about activity y on their r accounts, obtain targeted offers from a wide array y of merchants and d use Android's location-based d technology y to quickly y map nearby y merchants or r ATMs that accept Visa.

Capturing more payment volume will require investments in innovations such as prepaid, mobile and money transfer that harness the strength of our network and our brand. Finally, we plan to preserve and nurture our local market expertise while increasing our organizational effectiveness as a single public company. This will manifest itself in more coordinated and consistent pricing policies, as well as world-class risk management, controls and operations. Importantly, it will allow us to grow, reward and retain the very best talent.
Business owners such as this fabric merchant in India can benefit fi from the convenience of Visa payments.

In light of the ever-changing global economic environment, we are prepared to adjust our operations to ensure we deliver on the targets we set for ourselves and our shareholders. At the same time, we continue to invest in our core assets -- our brand, systems, products and strong relationships with our clients -- to position us well for the future.
