fellow shareholders:
In Kraft Foods’ 100th year, we once again delivered on our commitments, relying on the same enduring values that have inspired a century of growth.
Despite the marketplace challenges of 2002, including a weak global economy, volatile commodity prices and significant economic uncertainty in Latin America, we achieved strong results. Volume grew 3.1%, operating companies income increased 5.5% to $6.4 billion, net earnings increased 15.2% to $3.5 billion and diluted earnings per share grew 15.4% to $2.02.
Around the world, our success is built on two key strengths — the best brands and the best people.
And in 2002, this powerful combination of innovation and talent produced another year of accomplishment:
• New products generated $1.1 billion in net revenues.
• We acquired two new growth businesses in Australia and Turkey.
• Our volume grew 7.1% in developing markets.
• More than 20 million people around the world visited our websites each month for food ideas and information.
• In an independent survey of leading U.S. retailers, our customers selected Kraft as “Best of the Best” among all consumer products companies.
• The integration of Nabisco created new growth opportunities and strong synergy savings.
• We met our productivity target of at least 3.5% of cost of goods sold.
• We generated $2.5 billion in discretionary cash flow (operating cash flow minus
capital expenditures).
• We increased our dividend in the third quarter by 15% to 15 cents, bringing the annual rate to 60 cents per share.
• And in a very challenging year for equities, we delivered to our investors a total return of 16.1%.
Despite challenges in some key categories and geographies, our strong results extended across the company.
All six of our business segments increased volume, and five of the six grew operating companies income for the year. We saw a negative impact on income in our Latin America and Asia Pacific segment due to the economic issues we faced in several Latin American markets.
Kraft Foods North America
Beverages, Desserts and Cereals—Volume was up a strong 8.4%, once again led by growth in ready-to-drink beverages, including Capri Sun and Kool-Aid Jammers. Both Maxwell House coffee and Jell-O desserts gained volume as well. Operating companies income for the segment increased 3.1%.
Biscuits, Snacks and Confectionery—Volume increased 0.7% on strong growth in cookies and crackers from new products, including Double Delight Oreo, Chips Ahoy! Cremewiches and Ritz Bits. Snacks volume also was up; however, confectionery volume was off versus the prior year. Operating companies income was up 12.4%.
Cheese, Meals and Enhancers—Volume grew 0.5%, as gains in Kraft salad dressings, barbecue sauce and macaroni & cheese dinners, and It’s Pasta Anytime more than offset lower cheese volume. Operating companies income increased 3.3%.
Oscar Mayer and Pizza—Volume increased 2.3% on growth in Oscar Mayer hot dogs and bacon, DiGiorno Stuffed Crust pizza and Boca meat alternatives. Operating companies income was up 8.1%.

Europe, Middle East and Africa—Volume grew 4.8%, as gains from acquisitions along with growth in many markets more than offset lower volume in Germany. Operating companies income increased 12.3%.
Latin America and Asia Pacific—Volume was up 2.1%, led by gains in beverages, snacks and convenient meals. However, operating companies income declined 13.4%, due primarily to currency devaluations and difficult economic conditions in Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela.
Looking ahead to 2003, our business fundamentals are strong. However, two factors will restrain the growth of our earnings.
First, higher benefit costs, primarily related to pension and post-retirement medical expenses, are expected to reduce our earnings per share by 7 cents, or three percentage points of growth. The higher pension costs are primarily the result of lower returns on our U.S. pension-fund assets. Despite these lower returns, our U.S. pension plan is well funded, and we will not need to make a cash contribution in the near future.
Second, a new stock-based compensation plan using a three-year restricted stock grant in place of stock options will reduce earnings per share by 2 cents, or more than one percentage point of growth. The restricted stock will further align the long-term interest of employees with those of Kraft’s shareholders, and it enables us to expense stock-based compensation in a transparent manner.
Importantly, both the pension and stock-compensation expenses are primarily non-cash charges. We look forward to continued strong cash generation, with an expected increase in discretionary cash flow of more than 10% in 2003.
Diluted earnings per share for the year are targeted to increase 4%-6% to $2.10- $2.15. Other challenges, some anticipated and some we cannot foresee, also remain risks to these results.
If our focus were strictly short term, we might choose to roll back marketing support or cut our investment in product development to offset the combined impact on earnings of these issues. But in the long-term interests of our brands—and our shareholders—we will increase our investment in future growth. The health of our business is strong, and as we manage through these challenges, we are committed to keeping it that way.
The five enduring strategies we’ve used to build our business will guide our growth in the future.
Accelerate growth of core brands by:
• Focusing new-product innovation on four high-growth consumer needs—snacking, beverages, convenient meals and health & wellness.
• Capturing a greater share of the fastest-growing distribution channels.
• Expanding our products and marketing programs to connect with the rapidly growing
U.S. Hispanic population.
• Supporting all our brands with world-class marketing.
Drive global category leadership by:
• Using worldwide category councils to share best practices, fast-adapt product ideas, and optimize productivity and sourcing.
• Stepping up our expansion in developing markets.
• Building distribution in all markets.

Optimize our portfolio by:
• Acquiring high-potential businesses to jump-start us in fast-growing categories or countries and give us greater scale in existing ones.
• Divesting businesses that do not meet our growth or financial expectations.
Drive world-class productivity, quality and service by:
• Delivering annual productivity of 3.5% of cost of goods sold.
• Achieving ongoing annual synergy savings from the integration of Nabisco.
• Ensuring product quality and customer-service levels in all categories in all markets.
Build employee and organizational excellence by:
• Creating a winning work environment that values leadership development, diversity and work/life balance.
• Meeting our responsibilities to the societies in which we live, work and market our products.
As a result of these efforts, we expect that our volume growth will again be around 3% in 2003.

  As we close the books on 2002, we want to pay special recognition to Geoffrey C. Bible, former Chairman of Kraft Foods, and William C. Webb, a former director of Kraft Foods, both of whom retired in August. On behalf of the 109,000 Kraft employees around the world, we thank Geoff and Bill for their inspiration and leadership. Their guidance and expertise were a major force in the global success we enjoy today.
From all the people of Kraft over the last 100 years, we have inherited a company built on trust—trust in our brands, our beliefs and the commitments we make. As we look forward to 2003 and the next 100 years, our highest priority is to sustain that trust.
