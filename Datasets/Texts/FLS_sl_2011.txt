TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
The theme for this annual report ­ Strategic Evolution n ­ is a phrase we found ourselves using throughout the year. While we remained focused on the successful execution of our Key Strategies and meeting the needs of our customers, we did so with an eye toward the future to effectively position the company for continued, long-term success and create superior shareholder value.

First and foremost, it is important that we recognize the efforts of our approximately 16,000 employees in more than 50 countries around the world. Our continued industry leadership position as a provider of comprehensive flow control products, systems and solutions would not be possible without their expertise and dedicated customer focus. Our financial performance ­ notably $4.7 billion in bookings (up 10.2 percent from 2010), EPS of $7.64 (up 11 percent from 2010) and our highest fourth quarter backlog since 2008 ­ was accomplished despite significant geopolitical challenges and considerable foreign currency volatility. Aftermarket bookings grew 9 percent in 2011, demonstrating the success of our end-user strategies, including ongoing investments in our Quick Response Centers (QRCs) and efforts to be closer to our customers. Benefits of this strategy are also being realized through an increase in bookings from emerging markets. We expect this trend to continue in light of our expansion efforts in Brazil, China, India and Russia. Strategic Evolution n was particularly evident in important leadership and organizational changes. The most significant was the announcement of our unified operational leadership structure under Tom Pajonas as chief operating officer. This change is part of a process that began more than two years ago with the combining of our pump and seal divisions. We believe this unified leadership approach and One Flowserve e initiative will help us drive a strong culture of dedicated customer service and operational excellence, particularly around margin improvement and on-time delivery to our customers. We were also pleased to announce the addition of David E. Roberts to our board of directors and Michael S. Taff as chief financial officer. Both men bring a wealth of experience from the global energy, industrial and infrastructure markets.

The successful 2011 acquisition of Lawrence Pumps, Inc., affirms our inorganic growth strategy of "bolt-on" additions to our product portfolio. We will continue looking for opportunities where we can leverage our global sales force and aftermarket platform to grow these types of acquisitions and pull through additional products. Also this year, our board of directors endorsed a policy of annually returning to our shareholders 40 to 50 percent of the company's running two-year average net earnings in the form of quarterly dividends or stock repurchases. The policy reflects our continued commitment to a disciplined capital allocation strategy and demonstrates confidence in our ability to deliver strong cash flows in the future. We returned approximately $220 million to shareholders in 2011; $70 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases. Despite these cash outlays, our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to manage the company in a financially conservative manner. While we are pleased with our overall performance in 2011, we are particularly excited about the company's prospects for 2012 and beyond. Our projections for business growth and margin expansion are based on confidence in our end markets as well as our proven strategy to target expanding regions and growing markets. But most of all, our optimism is founded on our confidence in the dedicated efforts and abilities of Flowserve employees around the world.
