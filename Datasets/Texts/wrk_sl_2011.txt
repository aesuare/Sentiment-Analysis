 RockTenn | 2011 Annual Report
                          Dear Shareholders:
With the acquisition of Smurfit-Stone, there are two parts
of fiscal 2011 that merit reporting in this letter – the eight months prior to the acquisition and the four months following the May 27 closing of the acquisition.
For the first part of the year, RockTenn performed as our shareholders have come to expect. In short, we performed very well in a period of rising recycled fiber and chemical costs. For the first six months of the year, RockTenn earned a 14% annualized free cash flow return on beginning market equity, slightly lower than the return we earned in all of fiscal 2010. Our corrugated packaging segment earned a 22.3% EBITDA margin, once again the highest of any publicly reported company in our industry, and about 18% higher than our next closest competitors. For the full year, in our consumer

   RockTenn’s Corrugated Packaging and Recycling Leadership Team
With the acquisition of Smurfit-Stone
in May 2011, RockTenn acquired
12 containerboard mills with 7 million tons of total annual capacity, 98 converting plants and 31 recycling facilities. These facilities are led by
an experienced team well respected
in the industry. Pictured here are (clockwise from top left): Mike Exner, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Containerboard Mills;
Matt Denton, Senior Vice President, Finance; Mike Oswald, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Recycling and Waste Solutions; Steve Strickland, Senior Vice President
and General Manager, Corrugated Container; and Jim Porter, President, Corrugated Packaging and Recycling.

 RockTenn | 2011 Annual Report
                          packaging business, we increased folding carton sales by 2.2% in an industry that reported volume declines of 2.8%. Our merchandising display business also restarted sales growth as our customers’ renewed focus on promotional displays and the cost reductions we had achieved over the last two years enhanced our competitive position and main- tained our margins.
In our view, RockTenn’s 2011 GAAP earnings per share of $2.77 represent a remarkable achievement given the accounting treatment of acquisitions, which requires acquired inventory write ups, transaction fee expensing, the write down of assets that we knew we’d close but were required to write up on the opening balance sheet, among others, and the head- winds we faced with rising input costs for fiber, chemicals, energy and freight. In spite of these headwinds and the poten- tial for distraction from the tasks at hand from the challenge

 Meeting Global Demand for Containerboard and Bleached Pulp
RockTenn is North America’s largest exporter of virgin and white top containerboard, exporting approximately 900,000 tons of board each year from mills located close to Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico ports. RockTenn also exports fluff pulp to meet growing global demand.

RockTenn | 2011 Annual Report
                            of acquiring and integrating Smurfit-Stone Container Corporation, a company twice our size, RockTenn’s legacy operations adjusted earnings (adjusted to exclude the earnings accretion from the acquisition) were $4.62 per share, a 4.3% increase over 2010.
Having achieved this position of margin leadership, it is again worth stating our reasons for acquiring Smurfit-Stone, which now represents approximately two-thirds of our combined revenues. We believe containerboard and corru- gated packaging is a very good business that will get much better over the foreseeable future. The southern United States is the lowest cost major supply basin for container- board in the world, and we believe that the growing cost advantage of virgin containerboard mills in the southern United States is bound to improve as growing global demand

RockTenn | 2011 Annual Report
                            for containerboard will continue to be met with new recycled mills, further pressuring price levels for recovered fiber. Smurfit-Stone represented a unique opportunity for RockTenn to acquire a large, cost competitive, principally virgin container- board mill system for a price that will allow our shareholders to reap the benefit of the value we will create by applying the RockTenn business model to Smurfit-Stone’s larger business and by strategically investing in the acquired assets to build sustainable competitive cost advantages.
The box plant and containerboard mill system that we acquired is cost competitive in the U.S., with the cash cost of our large virgin brown liner and medium mills well below the estimated U.S. average cash cost. But equally important, we believe that through targeted strategic investments in the box plants and mills, and through intense focus on opera- tional and commercial excellence, we can greatly reduce the

    cost structure of our combined system. In fact, we believe that over the first 30 months following the acquisition, we will achieve performance improvements totaling $400 million that are in addition to the $150 million in acquisition synergies that we believe we will achieve. For a comparative reference to scale, that $550 million is about equal to the entire EBITDA of RockTenn prior to the acquisition. Thus, even though the next year or so may see lower EBITDA margins for RockTenn as a whole compared to RockTenn prior to the acquisition, we believe that this acquisition provides us an unparalleled opportunity to increase our profitability and to create value for our shareholders.
With four months experience operating our combined business, I can also say that the acquisition is succeeding on the three fronts we focus on to achieve our results. Customer acceptance of the acquisition has been very good. We are seeing many opportunities to expand our supply position with

RockTenn is North America’s Largest Paper Recycler
 
  RockTenn | 2011 Annual Report
                         RockTenn operates 39 North American recycling facilities that recover over nine million tons of paper fiber every year for recycling. RockTenn’s innovative recycling programs allow customers to better man- age their waste streams, capture maximum value for their recyclable materials and reduce their costs.
  1. RockTenn’s new Memphis, TN, facility houses the city’s first single-stream recycling plant.
2. With its new sorting technology, the Knoxville, TN, plant can process 70 tons of recyclables per day.
3. Single-stream processing broadens the mix of paper grades that can be used. Junk mail, books, newspaper, paperboard, catalogs and magazines separate from glass, steel, alumi- num and plastic containers, maximizing the revenue potential from single-stream recycling.

   major food and consumer non-durable goods’ customers given the much better geographic footprint and broader capabilities of the combined businesses. Our co-workers from both busi- nesses are working extremely well together, with our new co-workers willingly adopting the RockTenn culture and busi- ness model and moving with enthusiasm to help us identify and execute the best investment and performance enhancement opportunities. They recognize the significance to their business and personal career prospects of our plans to invest $500 mil- lion in capital expenditures in 2012, $400 million of which will benefit the acquired assets. And financially the acquisition is performing very well as we expected. Indeed, the accretion to earnings for the four months through September 30, 2011 has been $.88 per share.
We believe we have an unmatched opportunity to grow and prosper as we continue to execute our RockTenn business model, which is based on exceeding our customers’ expectations – every time they do business with us, doing

  everything we can to enable our co-workers to achieve personal and team success and investing for competitive advantage. Our strong financial position (our debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.6 times at September 30, 2011 is well within our optimal capital structure of 2 to 3 times) gives us the finan- cial capability to execute our business model and pursue
our objectives essentially without constraint. What will not change about us, however, is our commitment to our business model and to measuring our financial success on the basis of our free cash flow returns on market equity. Indeed, in the past 11 years, our co-workers, executing our business model, have caused RockTenn to earn a simple average annual free cash flow return on beginning market equity of just over 15%, with two years’ returns over 20% and only one year below 10% (the year was 2004 and the return was 8.4%).
Over that period we have borne out our conviction that RockTenn could consistently earn double digit free cash flow returns on market equity and continue to do so as the value of

RockTenn | 2011 Annual Report
                           our equity has grown. We continue to have that conviction for the future, strengthened today by our much stronger asset base, our conviction that sustainable, paper-based packaging is a good business that will get better, the opportunities presented by the Smurfit-Stone acquisition and, most impor- tantly, by the talent and dedication of RockTenn’s 26,000 employees. The remarkable results they have achieved show up in our earnings each quarter as I believe they will continue to do. On behalf of all of our co-workers at RockTenn, I express our appreciation to our shareholders for the confi- dence you show in us with your investment in RockTenn
and its future.
