Sales declines also resulted from decreased pricing as various commodity costs declined, as

Outlook

"

We are optimistic about our long-term growth prospects. Our strong balance sheet gives us the ability to grow organically and through acquisitions. Leveraging our category leadership and investing in innovation and our brands will help fuel our growth. Although we believe the recession will continue to impact consumer behavior in fiscal 2010, we expect a year of both increased sales and earnings. We anticipate our sales results will start slowly and gain momentum as the year progresses. Any significant improvement in the economy during the year will provide us with additional upside potential. Our greatest asset is our employees. I would like to acknowledge, with thanks, their important contributions to the success of this great enterprise. Their dedication and perseverance in the face of numerous challenges helped us maintain our leadership position in so many critical areas. I am confident they will take us to new heights, as we continue to grow our sales and profits for the benefit of you, our shareholders.
