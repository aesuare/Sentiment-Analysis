 To Our Shareholders
The Best Performance In Our History It was a banner year for Molex and for Molex shareholders. We met every one of our financial goals, demonstrating the Company’s increasing ability to capitalize on opportunities in the fastest growing industries and to fulfill the needs of customers anywhere in the world.
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2000:
We achieved record global revenue of $2.2 billion. This represents a year-over-year gain of 29.5% in U.S. dollars and 27.9% in local currencies, with every region of Molex contributing to the increase. The connector industry as a whole moved from flat sales in 1999 to 9.7% growth in 2000. Molex grew nearly three times that rate.
•
After-tax profits topped $222.5 million or 10.0% of sales, meeting our 10% after-tax profit goal
for the 23rd time in the past 28 years.
•
We expanded our market share to 7% and upheld our standing as the world’s second largest connector manufacturer, despite ongoing consolidation in the industry and intensified competition. We continue to make the cut as customers choose suppliers with global product development and manufacturing capabilities.
•
Our customer list now encompasses virtually all of the fastest-growing technology companies.
•
We introduced 406 new product families.
•
Our inclusion in the S&P 500 Index at the end of 1999 raised additional attention to
our long history of revenue and profit growth, heightening demand for our stock.
•
Most important, we delivered unprecedented value for our shareholders,
with earnings per share reaching $1.12, up from $0.91 in 1999.
Yet, the year was not without its difficulties. In addition to vigorous competition, we continued to face price erosion and tightening of margins. We also saw some of our productivity and sales gains undermined by significant currency transla- tion losses in certain parts of the world.
Internally, we were challenged by the installation of the Molex Global Information System in Japan and by delivery pressures associated with increased demand for our prod- ucts. Frankly, in many cases, the front end of our organization
outperformed the back end. This year, our ability to sell was better than our ability to service the business. Often this was due to our manufacturing teams’ not receiving timely updates from our sales force and our customers. Our new systems are helping us resolve these issues. Throughout the year, the people of Molex around the world worked hard to overcome the obstacles we faced, once again proving they are the best in the business. By the end of the year, we had returned to our traditional service levels for all but a very few new products.
Molex Incorporated 17 2000 Annual Report

 2000 Sales by Industry
  33%
Computer
 This industry is a mainstay for Molex. We’re winning new business with our ability to meet the high volumes required by the desktop segment, supply custom and miniature products for the mobile segment and develop high performance prod- ucts critical for high end servers and storage systems. We expect the market to remain strong, from workstations to laptops to palm computing.
 22%
Telecommunications
 Our rapid penetration of telecommunications, from only 6% of sales a decade ago, reflects our increased capabilities in fiber optics and technical savvy to develop high performance, high speed products required by cellular, wireless and Internet applications. Growth in Internet use and remote computing, explosion in the number of cellular phones and insatiable thirst for bandwidth will keep this market growing.
 18%
Automotive
 We nearly quadrupled automotive sales in the past 10 years. In addition to our custom capabilities, a major acquisition helped us broaden our offerings to include standard product lines. This combination places us in an extremely strong position with limited competition. With very large volumes and longer product life cycles, this market holds major upside potential for building our share.
 17%
Consumer
 More than 40% of our revenue 10 years ago, this category has diminished in share, but grown in dollar volume. A market that languished in the early ’90s is alive again thanks to digitization of audio and video; introduction of DVD, HDTV and flat-screen TV; and new electronic games and Internet appliances. Long-term relationships with key customers and leadership in miniaturization, digital technology and customiza- tion places us in an excellent position for continued growth.
 6%
Industrial
 We’re just beginning to tap this market, which includes manufacturers of produc- tion equipment for factory robotics, process controllers, electrical power equip- ment and transportation equipment. Longer product life cycles and consistent stable growth keep this area full of opportunity for Molex.

 STRONG GROWTH IN EVERY MOLEX REGION
Rapid growth of the Internet, the need for increased band- width and the surge in data and telecommunications applica- tions created new opportunities for Molex in every corner of the world, with OEMs, contract manufacturers and our dis- tributors. We also benefited from our longstanding relation- ships with leaders in the re-energized consumer electronics industry, ongoing wins in automotive and our added emphasis on the industrial market. It is interesting to point out that telecom and automotive, barely on our radar screen 10 years ago, accounted for 40% of Molex’s 2000 sales.
As the most global company in the connector industry, Molex generated about 60% of sales from products manufac- tured and sold outside the United States. That geographic pie slices up this way: 42.4% of sales from our Americas region, 23.5% from our Far East North region, 17.8% from the Far East South and 16.3% from Europe.
AMERICAS Our Americas region had an outstanding year, exceeding $1 billion in revenue. The region, which encom- passes the U.S., Mexico, Canada and South America, grew sales 39.1% and profits 45.6%.
A robust North American economy, strong regional man- agement and a record number of new products contributed to major share gains across all markets. Our datacom business was especially vigorous, driven by greater demand from man- ufacturers of high end telecom, networking and high end computer equipment.
We continued to leverage our internal technical capabil- ities and forge fruitful alliances with, and investments in, high technology companies. Of special note are our licensing agreement with Teradyne, Inc. for backplane connectors and our investment and partnership with Lumenon Innovative Lightwave Technology Inc. in fiber optics.
We are experiencing phenomenal growth in our fiber optic business. We opened a fiber-optic-dedicated facility in Downers Grove, Illinois during the year and, as this annual report went to press, we purchased a factory in Bolingbrook, Illinois for additional fiber capacity. Despite producing greater volume and achieving major reductions in cycle time, we still have a long way to go to reach the service levels at which we need to be.
Automotive was another area of growth for the Americas. We took advantage of the Big Three’s building of a record number of trucks and cars this year. Successful integration of our Cardell Corporation acquisition in just one year allowed us to offer the combined products of both companies and service the business through our new manufacturing presence near Detroit. While Cardell was less profitable than expected in 2000, it is improving, and we believe it will achieve our financial targets in 2001.
The region also experienced a healthy increase in system sales, as we continued to fulfill our customers’ need for con- nector assemblies. To accommodate projected strong growth, we are constructing a larger system sales facility in Nogales, Mexico.
A significant new business initiative during the year was creating an Industrial Division. To complement our own offer- ings to this market, we acquired the Beau Interconnect Division of Axsys Technologies Inc. in Gilford, New Hampshire. Beau specializes in U.S. and Eurostyle terminal blocks, barrier blocks and connectors.
Our outlook for the region is very positive. We anticipate double-digit growth in sales and profits and greater market share in every segment of our Americas business.
FAR EAST NORTH This region, which consists of Japan and Korea, increased 2000 sales 39.7% in U.S. dollars and 22.2%
Molex Incorporated 19 2000 Annual Report

 in local currencies, turning in its best results yet. Profits rose 41.6% in U.S. dollars and 24.5% in local currencies.
Molex Japan continued to drive growth through its excep- tional strength in engineering and product development, par- ticularly in connector miniaturization. Once again, it set the example for the rest of the company, both in the number of key new products developed and the rapidity with which they were successfully commercialized. Molex Japan also contin- ued to capture business in areas of more recent emphasis such as automotive, high end telecom and industrial, while growing its core markets of consumer electronics, comput- ers and business equipment.
The hugely successful introduction of consumer devices such as digital music players and digital cameras, as well as the rollout of the next generation of PlayStation accentuated demand for several Molex connectors developed and manu- factured in Japan.
To keep pace with growth, we expanded our Tochigi fac- tory and bought a new plant for fiber optic products in Kagoshima.
A major accomplishment in Japan was “going live” with the Molex GIS. While it was a struggle to bring all functions online, the system is now working well, and we expect to see customer service and productivity benefits from its use in the coming months.
What a difference a year made in Korea. Our business recovered very rapidly, largely from the introduction of many new products to fuel a revitalized economy. To meet rising demand, we authorized construction of a third factory in the southern part of the country.
Looking to 2001, we expect both Japan and Korea to con- tinue their double-digit growth in sales and profits.
FAR EAST SOUTH The Far East South had a good year, with sales rising 15.1% in U.S. dollars and 13.3% in local curren-
cies. The region, which covers Molex operations in China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, once again demonstrated its ability to be highly cost effective. Profits increased 38.5% in U.S. dollars and 37.0% in local currencies.
Our Far East South operations developed new business in notebook computers and computer peripherals, consumer electronics and cellular phones. We also made inroads into the cellular infrastructure market. Contract manufacturing remained the region’s fastest growing customer segment. More OEMs are outsourcing production and assembly of desktop computers and, increasingly, cellular phones and networking equipment. In addition, our system sales contin- ued to climb throughout the region.
Once again, the Far East South distinguished itself in the area of customer service. Particular strength in logistics gives us a significant competitive edge in delivery. We also are increasing our technical base in the region to serve the limited but growing design needs of computer, telecom infra- structure and wireless companies manufacturing there.
We greatly expanded our China operations during 2000. Our Shanghai plant—our third factory in China—opened with mixed results. Problems in the ramp-up stemming from relo- cation of most of our Taiwan manufacturing caused delays in shipping over a two-month period. However, production is now on track. In fact, we recently authorized significant expansion of our China 3 plant and purchase of a fourth facil- ity in northern China.
China holds major potential for Molex. We currently have a dozen sales offices that focus on multinational corporations manufacturing in that country. As more makers of consumer electronics, high end telecom, computers and peripherals move production to southern China, we believe we are very competitively positioned to serve them.
Our outlook for the Far East South is bright. We antici-
Molex Incorporated 20 2000 Annual Report
 pate an improvement in sales that reflects the recovery of the local economies and our further penetration of China.
EUROPE This region bounced back in 2000, posting an 11.4% increase in sales and a healthy 23.2% rise in profits in U.S. dollars. In local currencies, sales grew 24.9%, and profits increased 36.4%. Despite the depreciated euro, markets in the region improved substantially.
Building on a major share in telecom, our European operations produced the biggest gains from the fiber optic and cellular infrastructure markets. We secured additional wins from two of the world’s leading mobile phone manu- facturers, which fortified our already strong position in cel- lular phone handsets, headsets and key pads.
Automotive sales in the region increased overall, aided by new business from the French car industry. Leveraging our global expertise, we continued to win applications for passenger convenience and in-vehicle entertainment.
System sales also grew. To support this business, we further expanded our assembly capabilities in Poland and Slovakia.
Intensified telecom demand in Europe spurred the addi- tion of substantial manufacturing capacity in Ireland, where we purchased our third and fourth facilities, as well as an assembly equipment manufacturer.
In Slovakia, we broke ground for phase one of our first connector manufacturing plant in that country and moved into a new fiber optic assembly plant.
Future growth should be strong for our European region. We expect continued gains in the cellular, automo- tive and industrial markets, as well as with a wide range of smaller manufacturers via our distribution channels.
SURVIVAL OF THE FASTEST
If we could point to a single change that permeates every
aspect of what we do at Molex, it would be increased speed. The race is on—and it is a non-stop race—to think faster, act faster, service customers faster and get our products introduced and out the door faster.
To retain our leadership position, we must build even greater urgency into our organization, of course, without compromising accuracy, quality or service.
Here’s an overview of what Molex is doing to accelerate the pace:
Investing in new product development: We continue to spend a higher percentage of our sales on research and development than our competitors do. In 2000, we increased our R&D budget 21.6% to $128.8 million. This triggered intro- duction of 406 new product families and helped increase our penetration of the fastest growing electronics companies. Equally important, products developed within the past three years generated 31.1% of total Molex revenue in 2000.
Unlike quite a few of our competitors, we have never sought to acquire our way to leadership. Our strategy remains to build from within. This is why we spend so much on R&D and then on capital equipment to turn new product concepts into salable products.
That said, we have demonstrated our willingness to acquire technologies and companies that fill very specific niches in our operations and deepen market penetration. And we will continue to do so. In addition, we often invest in product initiatives aimed at fast growing markets or new applications, combining our marketing and financial power with teams of experienced engineers who have unique prod- uct ideas.
Investing in people and technology: We are fortunate to attract many aggressive, bright and hard-working people to Molex and to develop those who have joined us in the past. Our goal is to offer ongoing skills training at all levels with- in the company and to provide the most advanced tools to
Molex Incorporated 21 2000 Annual Report
 
 help people perform their jobs better and faster. In terms of technology investments, one of the most all-encompassing initiatives has been our four-year phased implementation of the Molex GIS, which is now online in more than 90% of our operations. Today, we are using that global database as the foundation for building our e-commerce capabilities, which will give customers greater, more convenient access to Molex people, products and information.
As a side note, we thought that after Y2K preparations, we would see some relief in spending on our systems. But that was not the case. We found our global support system more costly to run than expected, as well as realizing we needed to spend more than planned on e-commerce to fulfill the Internet needs of our customers. Still, these expenditures are absolutely necessary for Molex’s continued growth and they are proving increasingly essential to driving down costs and better serving customers.
Investing in new facilities and equipment: Here, too, we spend more than our competitors do in a relentless push to keep up with market demand, improve productivity and intro- duce a record number of new products. Capital spending— which reached $337.3 million in 2000, up 47.7% from the prior year—includes construction and purchase of new facilities, physical expansion and continuous improvements
in our factories. For 2001, we plan a further increase in our combined spending on capital improvements and R&D to approximately $525 million.
Investing in global functionality: Molex behaves more like a truly well-integrated global organization each year. In addi- tion to systems such as our GIS that eliminate geographic barriers administratively, we are breaking down those barriers in marketing and engineering and pursuing new business as a global team. We increasingly are selling in one region and producing in others, all the while being seamless to our customers. Yet, while seeking the economies of scale that centralization brings to certain functions, we are fighting to retain most decision-making within our regions and close to our customers. Achieving this balance is not easy, but very important.
In closing, we believe Molex can again attain excellent results in the coming year. For fiscal 2001, we anticipate 15% to 20% revenue growth, with profits increasing a bit faster than sales.
As always, we extend a sincere thank you to everyone at Molex for taking responsibility and sharing accountability for the success of this company. Additionally, we welcome to our Board of Directors Martin P. Slark, who has served as execu- tive vice president of Molex since July 1999.
