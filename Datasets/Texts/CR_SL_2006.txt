Letter to Shareholders

Dear Shareholder: In 2006, we achieved our second consecutive year of record earnings per share. At the same time, we took advantage of our strong balance sheet and free cash flow to acquire five businesses that we believe will accelerate our future growth. Net income in 2006 was $166 million compared with $136 million a year earlier. Earnings per share of $2.67 in 2006 increased 19% from $2.25 in 2005 and exceeded our guidance in last year's annual report of $2.45-$2.60. For the second year in a row, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend. The quarterly rate now stands at $0.15 a share, an increase of 20% over the prior year. We also repurchased 1,553,000 shares of common stock for $60 million. These actions are a direct reflection of our confidence in Crane Co.'s future. We deployed $283 million in capital on acquisitions, as difficult conditions in the North American vending industry gave us an opportunity to materially strengthen our position as the industry leader. We also acquired payment systems businesses with excellent growth prospects. These systems will now also be adopted in vending, as well as other channels. Our financial position remains strong. Reflecting the acquisitions we made in 2006, our net debt to capital ratio increased to 22% from 13% at the end of 2005. In November 2006, we completed a 30-year, $200 million bond offering with a coupon of 6.55%, which provides a significant, long-term source of capital for the Company. At year-end, we had cash of $139 million and an available credit facility of $300 million. We expect 2007 to be our third consecutive year of record earnings. Our well-positioned portfolio of late-cycle businesses is strongly focused on growth. With the added profits from the 2006 acquisitions, we are confident in our earnings per share guidance of $2.80-$2.95 for 2007. 2006 Financial Results Sales in 2006 increased $196 million, or 9%, to $2.257 billion compared with $2.061 billion in 2005. Organic sales growth accounted for $80 million of the gain, $20 million resulted from favorable foreign currency exchange, and acquisitions (net of dispositions) added $96 million. Each of our business segments contributed to our sales growth. Merchandising Systems accounted for the largest part, $92 million, because of the four acquisitions made in that segment in 2006. Fluid Handling and Aerospace & Electronics contributed $63 million and $29 million, respectively.

Operating profit of $248 million in 2006 was 16%, or $34 million, higher than the $214 million reported in 2005, with four of five segments showing gains. Operating margins increased to 11.0% from 10.4%. Fluid Handling contributed $31 million of the increase as a result of good sales growth and strong margin improvement from 8.1% to 10.7%. The Aerospace & Electronics segment's operating profit increased $14 million on higher sales and improved margins. Merchandising Systems' operating profit increased $5 million as the result of the four acquisitions, as core vending results declined on low demand. The Controls segment had a $2 million increase in operating profit. Gains in these four segments were partially offset by a decrease in operating profit of $13 million at Engineered Materials, reflecting reduced demand in the second half of the year, higher product support costs in the recreational vehicle market, and higher raw material costs driven by increased oil prices. Profitable Growth Our strategy for profitable growth has remained constant. We are a diversified manufacturer of highly engineered products, focusing on niche markets in which we have leading market shares that produce high returns and strong cash flow. Our business model is to become a more integrated operating company with a common intellectual capital process, a common business system and a common operational excellence program throughout the Company. We think we can create substantial value for our shareholders by a) materially improving our businesses through leveraging intellectual capital, improving customer focus and executing on our operational excellence program; b) driving strategic linkages among our businesses via internal mergers and "portfolio trimming"; and c) using our strong free cash flow to make acquisitions that strengthen our existing businesses. This strategy is resulting in a smaller number of larger units, stronger and deeper management teams, more robust and disciplined processes in our businesses, and tighter, more consistent results.

letter to shareholders

Materially Improving our Businesses We made considerable progress in strengthening our businesses in 2006: · We recruited strong operating talent for key positions in Engineered Materials, Electronics and several large units in Fluid Handling. Twenty-four high potential employees were promoted to positions in other Crane Co. units, and over thirty attended weeklong leadership-training programs. · From the individual cell on the plant floor to the Board of Directors in its monthly reports from management, we track on-time delivery, lead times and quality to assure our focus on the customer. We ask ourselves, "Can the customer feel it?" to determine if we are winning in the marketplace. Last year, three of our five segments had on-time delivery over 95%. · We continue to recognize that the strength of our Company begins at its roots, in the cells that are the smallest valueproducing units at Crane. We are managing so that each and every person, whatever his or her role, takes ownership of the output of the cell in which he or she works and feels pride in the contribution it makes in meeting the needs of our customers. During the year, 650 kaizen events were held, up from 350 held the prior year. Our focus in 2006 was on achieving manufacturing cell flow through 250 standard work kaizen events to measure and reduce cycle times and determine optimal operator loading. Visual management tools are being more and more broadly deployed across the enterprise so that management can see what is happening in the cells and immediately assist. As the visual cells were established with standard work, we moved to make sure they were linked together to deliver product on time. This linkage effort will continue to be a key focus of our operational excellence program in 2007.

The Fluid Handling segment represents 44% of our sales, and its results clearly demonstrate our efforts to improve our businesses. Operating margins in 2003 and 2004 had been slightly above 6% and about half of what we believed to be the segment's potential. These margins improved from 6.3% in 2004 to 8.1% in 2005 and a further 260 basis points to 10.7% in 2006. Since 2003, operating profit has increased 137% and sales per employee improved 42%. Working capital as a percent of sales has been reduced each year from 28.2% in 2003 to 22.7% in 2006. I like to say, "The more we improve, the more opportunity we see." We have now raised our goal for this segment's margins to 15%. Strategic Linkages In 2006, we continued to create value by driving strategic linkages. Plant consolidations yielded two excess facilities which were sold. In addition, the Westad Valve and Resistoflex Aerospace businesses were divested. Both were small units with fewer than 100 employees which we were unable to leverage in our larger Valve and Aerospace groups. These divestitures resulted in a modest gain and $26 million in cash proceeds. With the substantial improvements in our Fluid Handling businesses and a new goal of 15% margins, we are moving to consolidate eight valve units into four through internal mergers. We will be aligning the two major valve units to focus on serving two key end markets ­ oil & gas and chemical & pharmaceutical. As larger businesses, these units will better position us to target growth opportunities and to reduce costs. Acquisitions In 2006, we spent $283 million to acquire five companies. Noble Composites, which produces premium, high-gloss finished composite panels used by motor home and traveltrailer manufacturers, will add important breadth to our product offerings in the Engineered Materials segment.

letter to shareholders

In Merchandising Systems, we took advantage of difficult North American vending industry conditions to make two significant acquisitions: Automatic Products and Dixie-Narco. Automatic Products was the number two producer of snack equipment after our own National Vendors, the market leader. The purchase price of approximately $30 million did not include the manufacturing plant, and the operations were consolidated into the National Vendors St. Louis facility. Automatic Products gives us an expanded product offering, a complementary channel to market through distributors, and substantial manufacturing efficiencies resulting from the plant consolidation. Most recently, in October 2006, Merchandising Systems acquired Dixie-Narco, the largest producer of can and bottle vending machines. Its business difficulties and substantial losses were reflected in a purchase price of approximately $46 million for a company with $155 million in sales. A number of strong synergies with Merchandising Systems' other businesses made the company more attractive to us than to other possible purchasers. We have already taken significant actions to reduce the operating losses and return Dixie-Narco to profitability. These included top-grading the entire organization including direct labor, integrating sales and service with National Vendors, immediately fixing product quality concerns, reducing inventories, and beginning to leverage material savings from consolidated procurement activities. Our goal is to be the strategic partner to the beverage bottling industry, helping them drive growth via our new glass-front merchandiser, the BevMax 2. We expect demand for the new glass-front merchandiser to be stimulated by the broad range of package sizes now offered by beverage companies and the need to replace an aging installed base of vending machines. Our strategy in vending is to improve the profitability of the vending operator by improving revenues from each machine and reducing fulfillment costs. We are uniquely positioned to execute on this strategy with the most complete product line in the industry, the largest service organization, flexible payment systems solutions that facilitate higher price purchases, and software solutions through our Streamware® software that provide route operators with cash accountability and dynamic scheduling. In the payment systems market, Merchandising Systems has owned a small, niche European coin validation business, NRI, for over 20 years. During 2006, we acquired Cash Code, which makes state-of-the-art bill validators, for $86 million, and Telequip, which makes coin dispensers, for $45 million. While the payment solutions business has attractive growth prospects in gaming, retailing and transportation markets, the synergies with the vending business were what made CashCode and Telequip especially attractive to Crane's

Merchandising Systems segment. Both of these acquisitions have brought high-quality engineering talent, patented technology and exciting new product opportunities, and both have performed better than we planned. In 2007, we will be introducing our own bill and coin systems for the vending market. Asbestos Update During 2006, the Company incurred $69.1 million in asbestos-related defense and settlement costs, as compared with $45.1 million in 2005 and $40.9 million in 2004. Of the $69.1 million in incurred costs in 2006, $42.8 million were for defense and $26.3 million were for settlements. New claims filed against the Company have declined in the last several years from 18,932 in 2004 to 7,986 in 2005 to 4,853 last year. Asbestos claims outstanding were 85,941 at yearend 2006, down from 89,017, reflecting reduced new claims and increased dismissals. Actual pre-tax cash payments after insurance recoveries were $40.6 million, as compared with $45.3 million in 2005. We estimate that our 2007 asbestosrelated cash payments, net of insurance, will be approximately $50 million, excluding the benefit of the $31.5 million onetime settlement that was received in January. We continue to vigorously defend ourselves in the courts and are encouraged by the actions taken at the state level for tort reform. We remain strongly in favor of a federal legislative solution. 2007 Outlook Building on the solid foundation we have established, we expect another record year in 2007. We expect EPS of $2.80 to $2.95 for 2007, based on a forecast 14% sales increase, 8% of which is from full-year inclusion of the acquisitions made in 2006. We also expect operating profit to rise 13%, with each of our segments showing increases. Our free cash flow estimate for 2007 is $175 to $190 million, compared with $155 million in 2006. In December, the Board of Directors elected Philip R. Lochner, Jr., as a new director. He has had a distinguished career in both the private and public sectors and will make important contributions to Board deliberations. I would like to thank all of our directors, as well as our nearly 12,000 employees, for their hard work in 2006. In addition, I would like to thank you, our shareholder, for the confidence you have placed in us. Sincerely,
