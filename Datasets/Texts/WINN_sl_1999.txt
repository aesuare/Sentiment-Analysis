Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. 1999 Annual Report - Message to Shareholders

Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc.

Message to our shareholders

Consolidation and competition continue to change the supermarket industry. As the largest food retail chains grow larger, all major operators face the challenge of attracting shoppers by providing an increasing variety of fresher products and convenient services while operating more efficiently than ever to create value for customers and shareholders alike. Winn-Dixie continues to take bold steps to meet this challenge. In the past five years, we and our landlords have invested $4 billion an average of $800 million a year - to create the newest and nicest stores in the business. More than 76% of our stores today are new, enlarged or remodeled within the last five James Kufeldt A. Dano Davis Charles H. McKellar years, making us an industry leader in this Chairman Executive Vice category. More importantly, we achieved this President Principal Executive President without incurring long-term debt, keeping us Officer financially strong so that we can respond quickly and nimbly to our larger competitors. Our sales reached a record $14.1 billion in 1999. We are determined to build on this by remaining close to our customers and operating every one of our 1,188 stores as a friendly neighborhood supermarket with Exceptional Customer Service. Because of where Winn-Dixie operates, we directly compete against more Wal-Mart SuperCenters than anyone else, over 300 of them in the 14 states we serve. One of the best things about competition generally is that it makes good companies better. It makes a company strive even harder to improve everything it does - and we have made an executive commitment to our customers, shareholders and associates to do just that. We have acted boldly because we mean to succeed, just as we always have throughout our 74-year history. For Winn-Dixie, this year meant honestly comparing our own operations with the competition, hiring outside experts to advise us, learning from our best practices, and doing whatever it takes to give our customers not only nicer stores but also fresher products, friendlier service, greater value, more variety, true convenience and all of the other things that will ensure our success. Financial Strength Sound financial management remains a Winn-Dixie trademark. The record $14.1 billion in sales we achieved in 1999 represented our 65th consecutive annual increase, without long-term debt. Our strategy is to focus on our strength as a Sunbelt leader providing a wide variety of quality products and services at competitive prices. That is another reason we chose not to incur long-term debt to finance the $4 billion capital investment in store and support facility improvements. We have built a foundation for future

earnings, unencumbered by the burden of long-term debt. Our earnings this year of $182.3 million are not yet where we want them to be, but they reflect where we are in our transition. Now that we have created the best stores, we are moving ahead to generate future earnings by enhancing all of the other aspects of our business. Merchandising Today's customers want more than goods on shelves and in cases. They want home meal solutions. They want variety as well as freshness. They want seasonal sales and special promotions. They want convenience, whether they fill a shopping cart of just stop to pick up milk and bread. They want one-stop shopping that includes general merchandise as well as services like banking, pharmacies and one-hour photo labs. In the business, we call meeting those needs merchandising. It means giving customers what they want, when they want it. It means skillfully promoting what you offer, from customer-friendly advertising to attractive store displays. In November, we promoted Roy J. Brocato, former President of Winn-Dixie Atlanta and Vice President of the Company to the newly created position of Corporate Director of Merchandising and in January, we elected him Senior Vice President of the Company. Roy and his team of corporate merchandisers traveled the country and consulted with experts to identify the best merchandising techniques and practices being used. Walk into a Winn-Dixie today and you will see the difference. We offer not only ready-to-serve, chilled or microwaveable take-home meals, but we're also introducing meal solution areas where customers can quickly find all the items they want for a particular full home meal, all in one place. Throughout the store, we are enhancing our merchandising to give our customers a pleasant shopping experience tailored to their lifestyles and busy schedules. Produce Freshness We also have made an executive commitment to the freshness and quality of our produce. Consumer surveys show that this remains a key element in building and retaining a loyal customer base. As we did with our merchandising, we also looked at our produce operations from top to bottom, hired outside experts to advise us, and took action. To ensure the freshness and quality of our fruits and vegetables, we have increased the frequency of deliveries to our stores by implementing new ordering procedures and updating our distribution system to eliminate delays. We also have enhanced our training program so that our associates know the best ways to handle perishable items. What matters most to customers is that they can visit our stores on any given day and find fresh, quality produce. We have confidence that our customers will be able to count on this and come to know Winn-Dixie for produce quality, as well as for quality WD Brand® beef. Exceptional customer service As we focused in the last few years on upgrading our stores, we may have been slow to recognize some

Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc. 1999 Annual Report - Message to Shareholders

of the recent changes in what motivates people to provide Exceptional Customer Service. We also may not have fully appreciated that a strong economy and low unemployment create a somewhat less experienced workforce for large employers like us, making training even more vital. To enhance our associate training, we consulted outside experts and went to our own stores and others to identify the best customer service practices. WE have more than doubled our investment of time and resources in associate training to ensure not just excellent, but Exceptional Customer Service. Our associates working in service areas receive instructor-led certification with periodic retraining as we monitor customer service in the field. We have charged our district managers to lead this effort. We have directly involved our experienced associates, who are known for their own outstanding customer service, in conducting the training. Of course, what matters most to our customers is how they are treated when they visit our stores. Do they get a friendly greeting? Do our associates stop to acknowledge them no matter what other task they might be doing at the time? Do we give customers individual attention, whether they are in the aisles looking for something or moving through the checkout lanes? The customer response we are committed to receiving to those basic questions is an emphatic yes. Technology and facilities improvements To serve over two million customers a day - and do it efficiently - requires using advanced technology and constantly updating our manufacturing, warehousing, delivery fleet and headquarters operations. In 1999, we continued to upgrade our systems and facilities to help our 132,000 associates better serve the shopping public. These improvements benefit not only our retail store operations, but also the management and distribution systems supporting them. For example, improved marketing forecasts enable us to give customers "just in time" delivery of the items they want from our distribution centers. By putting items on our store shelves more quickly, we ensure freshness and reduce storage space at our stores. This keeps our costs down which, in turn, helps ensure low prices for our customers and a better return for our shareholders. The renovation of our retail support facility in Greenville, South Carolina, will soon be completed and we have made progress on the enlargement of our Charlotte, North Carolina, retail support center. We also have begun construction of larger retail support centers in Jacksonville, Florida, and Hammond, Louisiana. When we receive goods at our warehouses today, a computer on the forklift reads the bar code on the pallet, indicating exactly where the goods should be held for pickup and distribution to our stores. When the goods are shipped to the store, the receiving associate at the store uses radio frequency technology to log in the items quickly and accurately, with no paperwork required. Our manufacturing plants also are equipped with a world class system to enable us to better monitor and control production. We reduce costs and use only the freshest ingredients by maintaining lower inventories at our plants. Our tracking system allows us to follow ingredients through every stage of production and helps us to maintain consistently high quality in the items we produce. We routinely update our fleet operations to provide timely and reliable transportation among our facilities and stores. Today's loading methods promote easier and faster shipment and delivery. For instance, products are placed in family groupings and put on pallets for easy retail stocking. It is not

unusual for our stores to receive as many as five, six or even seven deliveries a week now that we have our fleet operations integrated into our improved distribution system. At headquarters, we have finished our consolidation of offices and accounting systems and have completed the new addition to our building. This will yield immediate savings of $3 million, as well as help us support our retail operations with increased efficiency and faster turnaround times. Because we began our companywide Y2K assurance early, we should have this task completed by September. Our emphasis on advanced technology is also visible in our stores. In 140 of our stores, for example, we have added self-checkout lanes for those customers who like this fast, easy option. In-store banks are another example of the convenient services made possible by advanced technology. In June, we announced an agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) to provide innovative banking services to our customers beginning this fall with a pilot program in Central Florida. Some 250 of our stores now provide in-store banking. Thank you We extend our appreciation to five other corporate officers who retired during fiscal year 1999. In addition to James Kufeldt, our President, James H Childers retired in December 1998 as Vice President and Director of Grocery Merchandising after 43 years with the Company. In June, James L. Cooper, Vice President and Director of Manufacturing, retired after 46 years; Richard J. Ehster retired as Miami Division President and Vice President of the Company after 41 years; Ray Raulerson retired as Vice President and Director of Information Systems after 39 years; and John Critchlow retired at the end of the fiscal year as President of Winn-Dixie Raleigh and Vice President of the Company after 31 years with us. We wish all these men well and thank them for their service. Writing our annual message brings to mind everyone in the Winn-Dixie family whose friendship, work and support throughout the year contribute to the success of our Company, our customers, our shareholders, our suppliers and business colleagues, and of course our associates, whose loyalty and dedication are the heart of Winn-Dixie. We are grateful to our associates not only for what they do for our customers but also for the time and support they volunteer to the communities in which we do business. This year, Winn-Dixie again honored hundreds of civic, youth, service and educational organizations with Good Citizenship Awards. The recipients were saluted at community luncheons and were given more than $12.1 million. Winn-Dixie Stores Foundation contributed over $2.3 million to community organizations during fiscal 1999. This total included $1.0 million in associate matching grants. Another $2.4 million in financial and in-kind contributions was donated by individual stores. Come shop with us In the 74 years since our founding, we have succeeded by changing with the times while still providing friendly neighborhood service and operating on a financially sound basis. As we near the next millennium, we have made a commitment to improve the things that have made us successful. In the face of consolidation and intense competition in our industry, we have taken bold steps to ensure that Winn-Dixie will strengthen its position as the supermarket of choice for millions of customers throughout our operating area.
