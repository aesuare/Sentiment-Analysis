To our valued

shareholders

Over the last few years Denny's has driven same-store sales growth, increased restaurant operating margins while adding labor and improving food quality, and invested much-needed capital into its facilities. Through these achievements we have been able to gradually improve our capital structure and significantly lower our interest costs resulting in Denny's strongest financial position in more than 15 years. Our continued operational and financial progress is attributable to the collective efforts of our employees and our franchisees. Together, they focused on doing their best to attract, delight and retain our guests. In doing so, they demonstrated that we have the team, the resources and the resolve to create long-term value for our shareholders. Same-store sales increased 3.2% across the Denny's system in 2006 and the fourth quarter marked the 13th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth for the system. For the year, Company unit same-store sales grew 2.5% while franchisee sales increased 3.6%. Growth in same-store sales was somewhat offset by the closure of 26 Company-owned and 27 franchised restaurants last year. The Company restaurant closures resulted from a thorough analysis which determined that either these restaurants did not meet our criteria for continued investment or through a closure we were able to unlock real estate value that exceeded the business value of those particular locations. We will continue to be diligent in our efforts to enhance our asset returns and make sound investment decisions for our capital. Overall, our sales results in 2006 were stronger than many of our competitors but were still challenged in our view. The environment was difficult due to pressures on our consumers from higher gasoline prices and interest rates. We responded to softening sales trends in the industry with promotions that clearly reinforced Denny's value proposition. Through a combination of new product offerings, a new advertising campaign and targeted discounting, we were able to improve guest traffic without sacrificing average guest check. Net income for the year was $30.3 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share, an increase of $37.7 million compared with prior-year net loss of $7.3 million, or $0.08 per common share. The significant increase in net income reflects gains on the sale of real estate assets during the year. Excluding these gains, as well as expenses related to asset sales, restaurant closures and refinancing activities, our profitability increased due to higher sales, improved operating margins and lower interest costs. We made the decision early in 2006 to sell our real estate assets underlying franchisee-operated restaurants as we believed these assets could create more value by using the sale proceeds to reduce our debt. Through the application of asset sale proceeds and operating cash flow, we reduced our outstanding indebtedness by more than $100 million in 2006. The resulting improvement in our balance sheet allowed us to refinance our credit facility with considerably

improved terms. The debt reduction combined with the improved borrowing rates should result in significant interest savings as we move ahead. We will continue to focus on growing guest traffic and average guest check, while controlling costs. New menu items such as our Super Slam breakfasts and our American Dinner Classics continue to communicate and reinforce two of Denny's strongest consumer attributes--variety and value. We will continue to develop exciting new offerings to make sure that Denny's is a competitive dining choice.

The competitive environment in 2007 continues to present challenges, but the fact that Denny's already has a strong consumer position in all four dayparts, particularly breakfast and late-night, provides us with a substantial competitive advantage. Our brand has always been built on full service, 24 hours a day. While quick-service operators seek to grow their business by extending hours and offering breakfast, Denny's is already well established. We offer great meals, value pricing and, most important, a long-established, positive relationship with guests. Much of our future success is predicated on our determination to support our employees so they can consistently satisfy our guests by delivering an exceptional dining experience. We are putting considerable emphasis on our human resources efforts in 2007 as we endeavor to hire and retain best-in-class managers and crew. We are committed to opening new restaurants after several years of concentrating on improving our existing portfolio. In order to stimulate unit growth in our franchise base we have created programs to serve as the catalyst for franchise development. On the Company side, we will continue to build a modest number of flagship restaurants in target markets. We have been pleased with the sales results of our new restaurants, both Company and franchised, as they continue to exceed the Average Unit Sales of our existing restaurants. We are optimistic about Denny's growth potential and continue to build our development pipeline. Debra Smithart-Oglesby, who has served on the Company's Board of Directors since 2003, succeeded Board member Robert Marks as Chair in May 2006. Debra's financial and restaurant experience, including franchisee management, are tremendous assets as we focus on profitable growth.
