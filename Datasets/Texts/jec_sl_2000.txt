  SHAREHOLDERS MESSAGE
We are pleased to report our results for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000. We had pro forma net earnings of $74,700,000 or $2.82 per diluted share on revenues of $3.4 billion. This compares to net earnings of $65,000,000 or $2.47 per diluted share on revenues of $2.9 billion for fiscal year 1999. Pro forma net earnings for fiscal 2000 excludes a special litigation charge of $38,000,000 recorded in the first fiscal quarter. Including this special charge, net earnings for fiscal 2000 were $51,000,000 or $1.93 per diluted share.
We reported total backlog at September 30, 2000 of $5.4 billion, which was a $1 billion increase from last year Ñ another record.
Though we operate in a diverse business climate, overall our workload remains strong, reflecting healthy economies in the U.S. and Europe; Southeast Asia and India continue to recover.
Specifically, Buildings, Infrastructure, Federal, Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology, and Telecommunications & Semiconductor are all quite robust. Chemicals & Polymers and
Pulp & Paper continue at the bottom of the cycle, but we expect these markets to improve in the coming months. Government regulations are driving the Petroleum Refining market, and we expect a significant improvement both in the U.S. and Europe.
During the year we continued our global expansion, adding a portion of the engineering business of Stork Engineering Group. This provided us
new operations in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Malaysia, and Thailand; areas where core clients are already located.
Our net income has grown at a compounded rate of 26.5 percent since 1987, as evidenced by the chart below. Our ability to grow our business at this steady pace stems from a combination of merger/acquisition activity plus continued improvement of our market share in the diversified sectors we serve. The business we operate in is very fragmented; no one competitor has significant market share. Thus, with our strategic diversification, we believe our long-stated growth objective of 15 percent per year at the bottom line is quite realistic.
We attribute this successful growth and expansion to our unique business model Ñ a relationship-based approach with approximately 70 percent of our work derived from long-term partnerships and alliances. This differs dramatically from the conventional industry model that relies heavily on discrete and transactional projects (see opposing chart).

  OUR RELATIONSHIP-BASED APPROACH DRIVES OUR SUCCESS
                         Continuous Improvement
  Lower Cost / Faster Schedule
  Consistent Earnings Growth
  Managed Risk
  Lower Sales Costs
      Working in tandem with our clients rather than as adversaries, our relationship model supports their continued growth, improved profitability, and market advantage in brutally competitive industries. This in turn reinforces the value of our business model and ensures our continued growth and success. For us, consistent earnings growth, manageable risk, lower sales costs, and a more predictable revenue stream have resulted.
This model is only successful when we are committed to superior performance at every level of the organization, and our clients trust us to guard their interests as our own. This includes providing our employees with the tools they need to do their best work. For example, we are investing heavily
JOSEPH J. JACOBS, Chairman of the Board
in our hardware and software systems to improve productivity and product quality. We have standardized our global work procedures so that we can effectively transfer work electronically from high-volume areas to those that are under-utilized; from high cost labor areas to low cost labor areas; and to take advantage of technical expertise company-wide. This ability to easily move work shortens schedules, reduces costs, and improves the quality of the services we provide our clients. Internally, our performance and safety award programs motivate our staff to achieve their highest potentials, to the delight of our clients.
Implicit to this strong relationship-based orientation is a persistent focus on providing a safe workplace for our clients and employees alike. We have a good safety program, but we have decided good is not good enough. We are retooling our whole program, looking for quantum improvements, so that even minor accidents that are commonplace today will be virtually unheard of in a few years. It is our goal to totally eliminate accidents from the workplace.
We take this opportunity to thank our employees, our shareholders, and our clients for their tremendous support over the past years. Because of your dedication and support, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.

President & Chief Executive Officer
