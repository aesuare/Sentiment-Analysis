2004 Annual Report
best-performing parts of our business in 2004 began as Corporate Breakthroughs.And we are now actively funding 32 Corporate Breakthroughs, representing a combined revenue potential of more than $1 billion.
We are committed to innovation, and we cultivate that commitment across the company in many ways. For example, last June we brought 100 of our best innovators together in our first Danaher Technology and Innovation Symposium. Even as DBS drives systematic innovation, events like this can trigger serendipitous synergies facilitat- ing innovation and growth.
Vision
We are making steady progress
towards the realization of our
vision of becoming a Premier
Global Enterprise. We know we
play a global game in the major
markets in which we participate,
and to win we must play the game
around the world — and we are.
Nearly half of our revenues today
are generated outside the United
States, up from 30% just 5 years
ago. Our Medical Technology
platform is our first platform based
in Europe and has served to raise
our profile and enhance our oper-
ating capabilities there. China is
another region of tremendous
opportunities for Danaher where
in 2004 our revenues grew by
more than 20% compared to 2003 due to a strong perform- ance from all of our strategic platform businesses.
We have also become more global in our manufac- turing footprint and supply base. In 2005 we expect nearly half of our production will originate outside of the United States with more than 30% manufactured in low cost regions. Our product development capabilities are becoming more global as well. In India, we established four new product development centers which are provid- ing efficient, flexible and capable additions to our product development capacity. We look forward to continuing these global initiatives in 2005 as we extend our reach to exciting new markets.
Outlook
We are proud of our performance in 2004 but remain focused on what lies ahead. Between DBS and the quality of our business portfolio, we’re exceptionally well posi- tioned for future growth and value creation. Many eco- nomic forecasters are predicting another year of growth for the markets we serve; and while we believe 2005 will be a good year for Danaher, we do not expect a repeat of those same strong economic conditions. As we stated publicly in December at our annual investors’ meeting, we expect our earnings to grow by 14% to 18% in 2005.
Over the longer term, our strategy for shareholder value creation continues to be core growth first, acquisitions second. Unfortunately, sometimes the pace of our acquisition activity over- shadows the quality of our businesses and their core growth performance. Last year we grew 9% on a core basis. At the same time, we continued to shape our portfo- lio to create a higher-growth and less cyclical mix of businesses
going forward.
We expect to continue an active
acquisition program with the same approach we’ve used so far. We look first for markets that offer growth and profitability opportu- nities, then for companies which can serve as sensible and strong entry points. Once we find them,
we vet these businesses financially to ensure they will create value, not just bulk. We’ve always said we intend to grow, but our real desire is to be strong. Our highest priority is bolt-on acquisitions that can strengthen our existing busi- nesses. Entry into adjacent markets is our second priority; transactions that establish new platforms are a third option.
Appreciation
I mentioned our 20th anniversary at the beginning of this letter. Everything we do at Danaher is geared to looking forward, not back (though DBS ensures that we learn from our mistakes). Still, every so often it’s reward- ing to see how far we’ve come and how true our course
 
has been. It’s also appropriate to honor the work of those who made our current opportunities possible. I know I have benefited immensely from what others have done before me — as have our customers and shareholders. I am incredibly proud of the dedication, professionalism and imagination of the 35,000 Danaher associates who continue to take the company to new levels of achieve- ment every day.
Our first and most important core value is “The Best Team Wins.” In 2004 our team demonstrated the truth in this statement more powerfully than ever.We choose these words carefully.We want great people on the pay-
roll.We strive to work together in the truest sense of the word “team.” And we play to win, not merely participate in our markets, for our customers and our shareholders. I’m proud and thankful for all our team did in 2004.They really are the best team around.
