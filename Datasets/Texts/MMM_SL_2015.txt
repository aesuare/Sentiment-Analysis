Annual Report 2015
To our
shareholders
2015 was a fundamentally important year for the future of our enterprise.
Our team delivered strong results in a tough external environment, while at the same time taking significant actions to position us for long-term success.
Strong Financial Performance
In 2015 our team executed well, controlled the controllable and
posted efficient growth across our businesses. Companywide, organic local-currency sales growth was 1.3 percent, with positive growth across all geographic areas and in four of our five business groups.
Earnings rose to $7.58 per share, a 1.2 percent increase year over year.
During the year we completed a corporate restructuring that resulted in a pre-tax charge of $114 million, and will deliver savings of $130 million in 2016.
Excluding this charge, we posted earnings per share of $7.72, up 3 percent year-over-year.
Net sales were $30 billion, down 5 percent versus 2014. This includes the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced sales by nearly 7 percent.
Premium margins remain a hallmark of our company, and we are able to deliver such margins even in low-growth economic conditions. Excluding restructuring, we expanded margins nearly a full percentage point to 23.3 percent, with all five business groups above 21 percent.
Our relentless focus on operational excellence also led to strong performances related to cash flow and return on invested capital, which are two of our company’s core metrics.
In 2015 we delivered a 22.5 percent return on invested capital, coming on top of a 22 percent return in 2014. At the same time, free cash flow conversion was a robust 103 percent, which is our second consecutive year above 100 percent.
Our cash flow strength is important because it enables us to consistently deploy capital in a way that creates the greatest value for our customers and shareholders.

                With respect to capital deployment, our first priority is to invest in the business. To that end, in 2015 we invested more than $3 billion in research and development (R&D) and cap-ex, which drive organic growth. Over the last five years, in fact, we’ve invested $16 billion in R&D and cap-ex.
Investments in our business also include acquisitions, which complement organic growth. In 2015 we invested nearly $4 billion in acquisitions.
After investing in the business, we have a long record of returning cash to our shareholders. And last year we returned nearly $8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
3M has paid dividends uninterrupted for 99 years, and 2015 marked our 57th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Building for Long-Term Success
In addition to delivering strong financial results, our team made significant progress in positioning us for success in both 2016 and well into the future.
At 3M, we run our enterprise with one eye on the microscope and the other eye on the telescope. The microscope view is to ensure we are delivering results day to day, quarter to quarter, and year to year. The telescope view is about strengthening our company for the future.
This means we must be nimble in responding to short-term challenges, while at the same time be steadfast in our commitment to investing for long-term success.
In 2015 we took action on both fronts.
On the microscope view, for example, we completed the corporate restructuring mentioned earlier, which was focused on structural overhead and slower-growing markets, with emphasis on the U.S., Latin America and the Europe/Middle East/ Africa region. This action will help us to navigate the current economic challenges in 2016, with projected pre-tax savings of $130 million.
On the telescope view, we made significant progress on our three key levers: Portfolio Management, Investing in Innovation and Business Transformation. These levers are critical enablers to 3M’s success in a future that will be even more competitive and dynamic.
Portfolio Management
Portfolio management is an ongoing process, and is all about strengthening and focusing our portfolio of businesses. This includes prioritizing the allocation of capital across our portfolio. It also includes combining businesses within 3M, along with acquisitions and divestitures.
Last year we consolidated two of our Health Care businesses – dental and orthodontics – into a single oral care solutions business. Now, through a seamless partnership, we can offer our customers a full suite of oral care innovations.
Since 2012, in fact, we have realigned from six business groups to five, and from 40 businesses to 26. These actions result in a portfolio of businesses that are more relevant to our customers, have greater scale, are more productive, and can move with even more speed.
In 2015 we also strengthened our portfolio through acquisitions. In particular, our Capital Safety acquisition bolsters our already-strong position in the fast-growing personal safety business, and the acquisition of Polypore’s Separations Media business strengthens our filtration technology platform.
At the same time, we divested three businesses that no longer aligned with our strategic objectives, including the library systems business.

Investing in Innovation
As a science company, research and development is our heartbeat, and is foundational to our success. It allows us to invent and manufacture cutting-edge products for our customers – which supports organic growth – and helps drive our premium margins and return on invested capital.
That is why we continue to invest in R&D, even when the external environment becomes more challenging. In 2015 we invested $1.8 billion in R&D – or 5.8 percent of sales – while expanding our scientific capabilities globally. We opened six customer technical centers around the world, and are opening a new, state-of- the-art research laboratory in the United States this year.
Technology conversion will remain a key economic driver into the future, and these investments are strengthening our competitive edge.
Business Transformation
Business Transformation – our third lever – starts and ends with our customers. It entails transforming our business processes so we can serve customers with greater speed and efficiency around the world.
The backbone is a global ERP system that we are implementing on a regional basis. Right now we are focused on executing our deployment plan in Europe, and in 2015 we had a number of successful roll-outs, including in the Nordic countries.
Last year we also announced three Global Service Centers, which will optimize our delivery of transactional services. They will also serve as a broader platform for operational efficiencies into the future.
Business Transformation is an important undertaking, with significant long-term benefits. We expect our actions to deliver $500-700 million in annual operational savings by 2020, and another $500 million reduction in working capital.
In addition to the progress on our levers, last year we invested in a new brand platform – 3M Science. Applied to Life.TM – which is enhancing awareness
of how we use science to solve problems for our customers. This will further enhance our reputation, build greater trust and loyalty, and open up new growth opportunities.
Also with an eye to the future, we released our new 10-year sustainability goals, which build on our commitment to protect the planet while growing our business. Last year, in fact, marked the 40th anniversary of our Pollution Prevention Pays Program, which has prevented 4 billion pounds of pollution.
When I look upon all we accomplished in 2015, it was a fundamentally important year for the future of our enterprise. Because of our work, we are a stronger, more competitive, and more focused company that is positioned to succeed in 2016 and beyond.
As always, I thank our shareholders for your confidence, our customers for their partnership, and our global team for their dedication to our success.
