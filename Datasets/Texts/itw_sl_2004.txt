To Our Shareholders
At ITW, discipline makes the difference. From developing innovative products to improving manufacturing efficiencies to targeting profitable acquisitions, we keep our eye on what matters most. As noted elsewhere in this repor t, our 80/20 business process makes sure that leaders at ever y level of our company focus on our most power ful and profitable oppor tunities. Putting these principles into practice and refining them for nearly two decades have made your company one of the premier manufacturers in the world. And one of the best investments anywhere. 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS Discipline keeps us accountable to our shareholders. Our focus on financial per formance has produced the consistent, quality returns outlined in the char t below. And fiscal 2004 was a ver y strong year, even by ITW standards. Revenues reached a record $11.7 billion, a 17 percent increase versus 2003. Notably, base revenues rose a robust 8 percent in 2004 while acquisitions and currency translation grew 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively. For the full year, income from continuing operations grew 29 percent to $1.3 billion, while diluted income per share from continuing operations of $4.39 was 30 percent higher than the prior year. Despite raw material shor tages and the escalating price of steel in Nor th America, total company operating margins rose to 17.5 percent--a 120-basis-point gain year over year. The improvement came even though margins were diluted over the shor t term by the acquisition of 24 companies during the year, representing nearly $624 million of annualized revenues. Free operating cash flow increased to $1.3 billion, up from $1.2 billion in 2003, while our return on invested capital improved to 18.5 percent, up from 16.1 percent the prior year. LEADERSHIP FOR THE FUTURE Results like these are driven not just by the 80/20 process itself, but by the ability of ITW managers to understand and apply it ever y day. Because this management capital is our most impor tant asset, we take a ver y disciplined approach to our leadership development and succession. By and large, we promote from within. ITW's highly decentralized structure and entrepreneurial culture create opportunities, as well as challenges, for our managers. Combining that practical experience with professional development programs produces a talented, trained and tested corps of leaders within the company. Your senior management team, for example, averages 26 years of ser vice. Our Executive Vice Presidents are each responsible for roughly 75 businesses generating more than $1 billion in revenue. Together with their general managers and strong suppor t teams, they provide tremendous executive bench strength and ensure a continuum of leadership for the future. This past year was a critical one for management succession at ITW. Following my announced decision to retire in 2006, David Speer was appointed president of ITW in August 2004. David is expected to become CEO in 2005. Formerly an Executive Vice President for ITW Construction, Wilsonart and Finishing, David has held progressively more responsible operating positions since first joining the company in 1978. He currently has operating responsibility for all ITW businesses worldwide. Your board of directors believes David will do an outstanding job leading ITW for ward.

In a related appointment, Craig Hindman was elected to the newly created position of Executive Vice President of Wilsonart, a business line previously managed in tandem with ITW Construction. Craig has spent the last 29 years at ITW and ser ved most recently as president of our global finishing businesses. Two other key members of the management team plan to retire in 2005. A 29-year veteran of ITW, Vice Chairman Frank Ptak has relinquished his duties as head of our welding business units. He has been succeeded by newly elected Executive Vice President Scott Santi, who has spent his entire 22-year career at ITW--most recently as President of Welding Products Focus Markets Group. Jon Kinney also will be retiring as Chief Financial Officer in the second half of 2005 after 32 years of ser vice at ITW. Your company is currently assessing internal candidates to fill his position. Frank and Jon will be with us for much of 2005, but we want to thank both of them for their friendship and their significant contributions to the company over the years. We wish them the ver y best. Lastly, we want to extend our thanks and best wishes to Jim Ringler, who retired at the end of 2004 after more than 15 years with the company. As Vice Chairman and head of our food equipment business, Jim came to us with the 1999 Premark acquisition and made significant contributions to ITW during his tenure. He has been succeeded by newly elected Executive Vice President Jack Campbell. A 24-year veteran of ITW, Jack brings strong operational exper tise to this position thanks to his wide range of experience within the company, including his most recent assignment as head of the marking and decorating businesses.

The depth and breadth of management talent is one of your company's greatest strengths. Cultivating homegrown leaders and taking a disciplined approach to succession planning help ensure continuity and a commitment to excellence going for ward. A BRIGHT FUTURE Disciplined attention to financial per formance, management strength, product development and acquisition activity has made your company stronger today than ever before. Staying disciplined and focusing on our operational goals--growing base revenues, making value-adding acquisitions and improving operating margins-- will make it even stronger in the future. In 2004, as always, we owed our success to the ongoing suppor t of our many long-term customers, suppliers and shareholders. We also appreciate and thank our 49,000 employees around the world for their effor ts and exper tise. All of us at ITW remain dedicated to delivering superior results today and creating exciting growth oppor tunities for tomorrow.
