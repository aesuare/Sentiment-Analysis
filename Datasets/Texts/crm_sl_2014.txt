Fellow stockholders,
As we celebrate our 15th birthday this year, there are only two words that could express our gratitude: thank you. Thanks to the success of our customers, we have become one of the ten largest software companies in the world. Gartner has recognized salesforce.com as #1 for total CRM worldwide software market share by revenue in 2013. Forbes Magazine has named salesforce.com as the World's Most Innovative Company three years in a row. Fortune Magazine has ranked us #7 among the World's Best Places to Work and the World's Most Admired Company in our industry. The Salesforce1 Platform has become the way customers can run their business from their phone! It is the only mobile-first, API-first, CRM platform that enables customers, partners and ISVs to build and deploy apps rapidly in the cloud. Today, customers can choose from thousands of business apps on the Salesforce AppExchange. Our focus on customer success is why we achieved more than $4 billion in revenue this year, and why we are anticipating more than $5 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2015. No other software company of our size is growing at this speed. But perhaps our most important achievement is the success of the Salesforce Foundation, which now supports more than 20,000 non-profits and NGOs, has delivered more than 580,000 hours of volunteerism and has given more than $55 million in grants. This commitment to philanthropy is one of the reasons why Ethisphere once again named salesforce.com as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies. I would like to extend a sincere thank you to our customers and partners for their inspiration, our 13,000 employees for their focus on customer success, and to you, our stockholders, for your continued support. Aloha,
