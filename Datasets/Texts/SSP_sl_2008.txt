        LeTTer To sHareHoLDers
 To our shareholders:
Let’s start with the bottom line. Our No. 1 priority for 2009 is to protect the financial health and flexibility of the company. We’re passing through one of the most difficult periods in the history of the U.S. economy, and along the way we’re being tested like never before. But on the other side, we anticipate attractive opportunities for those media companies with vision and resources. We intend to be among those ready to thrive.
In the near term, we’re taking the medicine necessary to protect our long-term health. Faced with double-digit declines in ad revenue at our newspapers and TV stations, we moved to cut expenses and improve cash flow by, among other initiatives:
• Reducing salaries at the newspapers and among our shared services and corporate staff by 3-to-15 percent
• Using voluntary furloughs and a range of other measures to reduce employee expenses at the TV stations and United Media
• Freezing our pension plan later this year
• Suspending the company’s match of employee contributions to their 401(k) plans
• Reducing by as much as 75 percent the bonus opportunity available to managers in 2009
• Continuing hiring freezes and headcount reductions except where we believe there is a clear return on investment for the new or replaced positions
• Suspending the dividend
We also concluded early in 2009 that Scripps did not have a future in Denver, where we had published the Rocky Mountain News since 1926. On Feb. 27, just shy of the Rocky’s 150th anniversary, we closed the paper and announced plans to unwind our 50/50 partnership with the publisher of the Denver Post. It was painful. More than 200 journalists lost their jobs, but we faced a business partnership that simply was not sustainable.
Although all Scripps employees have been affected in one way or another by these changes, they have been gracious and understanding of the difficult decisions made to maintain the financial stability of the enterprise.
That’s because, I believe, we have what will matter most in the effort to build long-term value for shareholders – a wealth of talented and creative entrepreneurs who share a desire to define the next successful season for local media companies. They also are people of purpose who embrace the Scripps strategy to reap economic reward through public service.
So while the months ahead could include some of the most challenging days in the long history of Scripps, we have the ingredients for long-term success – terrific talent, low debt, and a healthy base of good local markets on which to build value.

         The year ahead
As we issue this report, advertising revenues – the lubricant for the consumer economy – continue to decline year-over-year in both the newspaper and broadcast TV markets. Some of the weakness in television is due to the every-other-year cycle for political advertising; 2009 is an off year while political spending should provide a lift for TV in 2010.
Given the tough revenue environment, here are our priorities for 2009:
• First and foremost, protect the financial health of the company. We have no control over the broad economy so we must focus instead on successfully maneuvering through the storm. Keep debt low; increase our share of locally available revenue; focus resources for the best return in this environment.
• Move aggressively to restructure the newspaper business model by further expanding the Internet audience and revenue base, and at the same time continue to consolidate functions and activities that do not affect readers and advertisers.
• Finish a project to restructure TV newsrooms to reduce inefficiencies and, at the same time, increase the resources devoted to valuable storytelling and audience development.
• Focus primarily on the markets where we do business today. In recent years, Scripps has shifted its portfolio of business into largely growth markets. While over time it might make sense to expand our geographic footprint, our commitment in this economic environment is to increase our local share and make more money in the good markets where we already are invested.
• Support our long-term determination to be the local news and information leaders in all of our markets. Regardless of whether we begin with a TV station or a newspaper, we’re determined to expand our audiences across all available plat- forms to ensure that we are the market maker of choice in this highly competitive environment for media.
• Despite economic challenges, increase our standards and expectations for content quality and public service.
Whether it’s breaking news, great storytelling or aggresive investigative reporting, we can settle for no less than the best we have to offer. Media consumers have many choices these days. We must engage and surprise them at every opportunity.
A big transition
Bill Burleigh, an outstanding journalist and a leader who accepts no compromise on the quality of content and public service, steps down as chairman of the board effective at the May 5 annual meeting. His retirement from the board caps a career with Scripps that began in the 1950s in Evansville, Ind. From reporter to editor to president/CEO and then chairman, his clear and discerning voice has guided Scripps to many of its successes. We’ll miss his expertise and insight and plan to interrupt his retirement often for words of advice.
Bill will be succeeded by Nackey Scagliotti, a great-granddaughter of the company’s founder, a director since 1999, and an experienced media professional who has played a vital role in the development of Scripps in recent years. Nackey, like many of the Scripps family leaders before her, demonstrates a relentless determination to reward shareholders by support- ing the company’s entrepreneurial culture. We’ll be in good hands while she holds the chairwoman’s gavel.
Sincerely,
Richard A. Boehne
President and Chief Executive Officer March 2009
