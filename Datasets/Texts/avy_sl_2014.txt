Letter to Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholders: I'm pleased to report on a year of substantial progress in building sustainable momentum. By this term, I mean both delivering solid long-term results for shareholders and fulfilling our commitment to a better world ... for people and for the planet. We operate in an environment being made warmer by greenhouse gas emissions; in which raw materials are becoming scarcer and more expensive; and in which social media have increased expectations for incredible transparency and immediacy. As industry leaders, our two core businesses afford us a unique opportunity to drive the agenda for creating a more sustainable world for all stakeholders.
In 2014, we delivered a double-digit increase in earnings per share, substantially increased our return on invested capital, and returned more than $480 million to shareholders through the repurchase of 7.4 million shares and payment of dividends, which included a 21% increase in our quarterly dividend rate. In 2012, we set challenging financial targets for the four years through 2015 and have made substantial progress toward achieving them. In May of last year, we updated those targets through 2018, raising our long-term growth objectives and increasing targets for both operating margin and return on capital. Our long-term targets and our progress against them are outlined in our investor presentation at www.investors.averydennison.com. We have built sustainable momentum in value creation by following a clear strategy: » Grow through innovation and differentiated quality and service,  and by investing in select high-potential market segments.

» Expand margins by increasing productivity and accelerating growth  in high-return market segments.

» Use a disciplined approach to investing in our business and returning  cash to shareholders.

Letter to Shareholders

Our significant competitive advantages ­ high relative market share, economies of scale, leadership in emerging markets, technical expertise and innovation capabilities ­ have enabled us to grow faster and deliver higher returns over the past three years. To maintain this momentum and ensure we achieve our 2018 objectives, we are refining our strategy to drive profitable growth in all of the market segments in which we compete. Pressure-sensitive Materials (PSM) Pressure-sensitive Materials delivered its third consecutive year of strong volume growth while maintaining its profitability and high return on capital. PSM is a great business, and we believe it can be even better. Until relatively late in 2014, PSM's sales growth did not deliver as much profit growth as we expected due to pricing pressures and the mix of products we were selling. We also saw some slowing in demand in a few regions in the second half of the year. The PSM team is addressing these challenges by reducing costs and improving productivity to enable us to be more competitive in less-differentiated market segments. At the same time, we are making additional investments in market segments with higher profit potential, including Performance Tapes and Graphics Solutions, as well as in faster-growing emerging markets. We continue to invest in innovation and new capability in PSM. We are adding new coating capacity in Asia for all product lines, and we have nearly completed a major restructuring program in Europe that will enable Graphics Solutions to compete more effectively. We continue to build customer loyalty through innovation, which remains a priority for PSM. We exceeded our target for sales from new products in 2014, led by Avery Dennison ClearCutTM adhesive technology, which enables the use of thinner films, contributes to cleaner press operations and delivers a clearer, no-label look. We also won industry awards for our new tire label material, which adheres to tires more securely than previous products. Retail Branding and Information Solutions (RBIS) RBIS, the leading provider of end-to-end branding and information solutions for the retail apparel industry, faced top-line growth challenges in 2014. This was due primarily to share loss in the value and contemporary market segments, which was partially offset by solid growth in the performance segment and radio-frequency identification (RFID). RBIS is focused on recapturing share in the value and contemporary segments by providing a better value proposition to the apparel factories that serve these

segments, particularly in China. At the same time, we are further reducing our cost structure to achieve our goals for margin improvement. Like PSM, RBIS is also driving growth through innovation in higher-potential segments. For the second consecutive year, we achieved double-digit growth in external embellishments. Of note, we produced the logos and emblems on threequarters of the team jerseys in last year's World Cup. Another RBIS team applied its expertise in weaving fabric labels to craft an extraordinarily light and strong onepiece upper for athletic shoes. This technology is a unique extension of our expertise into a new market segment and an exciting new growth opportunity for us. RFID remains a key growth catalyst. Our customers remain committed to the technology and our partnerships, and we are also seeing heightened interest in new pilots and roll-outs. We continue to expect RFID to grow 10 to 20 percent through 2018. I'm confident about the future of RBIS. Underlying demand for apparel hasn't changed; our value proposition for the performance and premium market segments remains strong, and we know how to develop a comparably strong offering for the less-differentiated value and contemporary segments. We expect an improvement in the RBIS sales growth trajectory by mid-year and for the business to resume its strong pace for margin expansion. Vancive Medical Technologies Vancive, our small but high-potential medical products business, delivered sales growth at the high end of our long-term target in 2014. A highlight was the positive reception given to our Metria® IH1 Lifestyle Assessment System, which uses a disposable wearable sensor to provide wellness data. In 2015, we will continue to focus on the milestones needed to drive growth in this promising platform. Sustainability In addition to the actions we are taking to drive long-term economic returns, we are building sustainable momentum in terms of the planet and people as well. We are taking into account the risks and opportunities that are being created by the impact of climate change and rising consumption on resources, and the rising demand for transparency, to build a more resilient and prosperous business. By operating in ways that reduce our impact on the environment, we reduce costs; by providing safe working conditions and paying fair wages and benefits, we foster greater employee engagement, productivity, creativity and performance.

And by developing products that enable our customers' supply chains to be more sustainable, we can accelerate growth. Avery Dennison will lead in our key markets by building on a legacy of innovation, integrity, workplace fairness and community involvement. By doing so, we create long-term value for shareholders, customers, employees, and the communities in which we operate. I'm especially proud of the work we are doing to help our customers and suppliers. For example, we are dramatically increasing the percentage of responsibly sourced paper in our label materials. In one year, we have used our scale and innovation to expand our portfolio of products incorporating Forest Stewardship Council-certified paper ­ and offer these products at price parity. Our portfolio is now the largest in the industry; in Europe, more than 60 percent of the paper facestock on materials we sold last year was FSC-certified. Our actions are helping to move the labeling industry toward more sustainable products and enabling us to manage business risk by ensuring that we have long-term access to a critical raw material. In 2015, we will reach the end of the five-year period we set for our first long-term sustainability goals, and we are on track to meet or exceed them. Now we are going to be much more ambitious and visionary, setting goals not for five years, but for 10. Our 2025 goals, which we plan to publish later this year, will include new targets for energy efficiency, responsible sourcing, waste reduction, safety levels, community investment and gender diversity. Stan Avery said he started our company when he realized that by running a great, ethical business, he could help more people than by doing charitable work. His desire to help people with products, employment, and community involvement is at the heart of everything we do. By caring for the planet and people, we are better prepared to thrive and benefit all of our stakeholders. Transitions This April, Director Rolf Börjesson will retire from our board of directors after 10 years of service. Rolf's experience and expertise in the packaging industry have enabled him to provide invaluable guidance, and I wish him the very best. In September 2014, we lost H. Russell Smith, one of the most important figures in our company's history. Russ, who held every senior leadership role over his 40 years with the company, was Stan Avery's partner in entrepreneurship; together they turned Stan's inventions into a global enterprise. A model of values-based leadership, Russ played a key role in creating our culture of integrity, inclusiveness

and empowerment. Because of him, Avery Dennison is a place where individuals can come to work and make a difference every day. In November 2014, the board of directors elected Mitchell R. Butier as president and chief operating officer. As chief financial officer, Mitch has been a great thought partner in shaping our business model and designing our value creation strategy. We have worked together for more than a decade, and I look forward to our new partnership in building this great company. Finally, I am delighted to welcome Mitch's successor, Anne L. Bramman, who will soon join us as our new senior vice president and chief financial officer. Anne is a world-class finance executive and strong business leader, and her extensive experience in overseeing complex global operations at market-leading companies makes her ideally suited for the role. 80 Years Avery Dennison will turn 80 in 2015, an achievement I attribute to our extraordinary employees. From 1935 to the present day, great people have joined the company and given their best to build Stan Avery's small business into an industry leader. I want to thank our current team for their work in 2014, and all Avery Dennison employees for their contributions over eight decades. In the past four years, we have worked through challenging economic conditions, refocused the company and built solid, sustainable momentum. In 2015 we will continue on the journey toward becoming a more resilient and sustainable enterprise. We intend to deliver exceptional value for our customers, employees, and shareholders, not just for the next 80 years, but for generations to come. Thank you for your investment in Avery Dennison.
