To Our Shareholders:
On April 16th, CSC marked its 40th anniversary. Over the last four decades, we have produced a stellar record of service to clients and, during that same period, have delivered an impressive record of growth and profitability.
Our demonstrated ability to see what lies ahead and our proven agility in meeting emerging challenges and taking advantage of new opportunities will serve us well as we approach the new millennium. And the opportunities clearly are there. At some point during the year 2002, the information technology marketplace is expected to cross the trillion-dollar threshold.
A market that size provides robust prospects for industry-leading companies like CSC. The breadth of our skills and service offerings, the depth of our technology, and our global reach and market expertise combine to give us a balance and business diversity that few in our industry can match. And this balance and business diversity has been and will continue to be the key to success for CSC.
We are excited by the enormous range of opportunities we see going forward, and if the year just ended is any measure, the future is indeed bright.
CSC posted higher profits, recorded more revenues and won more new business in fiscal 1999 than any year in our history.
Net income of $341 million increased 31 percent over last year, or 25.2 percent excluding last year’s special items. Revenues totaled $7.7 billion, an increase of 16 percent over the $6.6 billion earned in fiscal 1998. Our revenue growth was driven by strong demand for CSC's services around the world, particularly for consulting and systems integration services in the areas of e-business applications, enterprise-wide solutions and outsourcing.

As companies around the world increasingly turn to the Internet to market their goods and services, e-business becomes central to their mission-critical business planning. Worldwide information technology spending for hardware, software and services associated with e-business implementation is expected to exceed $50 billion by 2002, including emerging e-business initiatives in electronic billing systems and supply chain management. A majority of CSC's engagements include Internet components, which are proliferat- ing as companies build their e-business infrastructure and implement their strategies in this explosively growing area.
In May of this year, we announced a key development in our e-business strategy. CSC will participate in the Sun-Netscape Alliance Preferred Integrators initiative and will train and certify thousands of CSC consultants on the Sun-Netscape product line. As a result, we will offer our clients stronger and more flexible business services and solutions to capitalize on the opportunities that e-business technologies afford them.
Our new business performance in fiscal 1999 was outstanding. We announced more than $5 billion in new awards, excluding a landmark contract with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service which has not been publicly valued, but is estimated to be worth as much as $8 billion by various industry and financial analysts. Other significant awards include a $300 million outsourcing contract with AT&T; a $198 million systems integration award from the U.S. Postal Service; a $200 million outsourcing contract with Budget Group, the parent company of Budget Rent a Car; and a $320 million outsourcing agreement with Republic National Bank. These and a number of other important awards will deliver significant revenues and strengthen CSC’s market position in fiscal 2000 and beyond.
Outsourcing contracts bring more than revenues to CSC. They add highly skilled information technology professionals to our workforce. In fact, of our 50,000 employees, over 12,000 joined the company as the result of outsourcing agreements. Another source of talent is our acquisition program. Nearly 20,000 of our employees came to CSC as their companies joined ours.
In fiscal 1999, we announced eight acquisitions that will increase our staff by more than 3,000 employees. In the Asia-Pacific region, we acquired CSA Holdings, one of the largest information technology services companies in the region. In Europe, we added KMPG Peat Marwick SA, a leading French consulting firm; SYS-AID, a Netherlands-based services company that increased our management consulting and ERP capabilities; Pergamon GmbH, a German-based I/T company serving European mortgage lenders;
and Informatica Group SpA and four companies of the Progres Group that greatly expanded our capabilities in Italy. And in the United States, we acquired Onward Technologies, a web-focused consulting and systems integration firm, and T-Wack Software Group, a developer of software for use in client-server and Internet applications.
Today's global knowledge economy is causing corporations and governments to rethink their operations. Competition, rapid advances in technology and corresponding shifts in client expectations are forcing significant change. This requires that CSC not only understand the resulting implications, but also be adept at leveraging its own knowledge base. We capture everything we learn – tools, best practices, ingenious solutions to client problems – and share them across the company through CSC Sources, our own global environment for knowledge sharing. When a solution is being sought, the combined knowledge and experience of our professional staff across our global commercial and U.S. federal operations can be brought to bear on the problem. This is a formidable capability and a distinguishing competitive advantage for CSC.
As we look at fiscal year 2000, opportunities abound. In the first two months of the year, we announced the award of a $1.2 billion outsourcing contract with Pratt & Whitney and a $1.1 billion agreement with Enron. We continue to be the leading information technology services supplier to the U.S. federal government, and our growth prospects in the global commercial marketplace are strong.
As always, my sincere thanks for another year of extraordinary performance by CSC's 50,000 employees who again have demonstrated that they are the best in the business.
Sincerely yours,
   Van B. Honeycutt
