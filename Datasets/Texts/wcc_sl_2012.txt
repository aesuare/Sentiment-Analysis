2012 Annual Report

 To Our Shareholders, Employees, and Business Partners
Delivering Profitable Growth
2012 was a landmark year for our company. As a result of playing offense and executing the growth strategy launched three years ago, we have strengthened our business and enhanced our position in the global marketplace. We achieved record sales of $6.6 billion on 7% sales growth, improved operating margins to 5.6%, increased earnings per share over 10%, and generated free cash flow in excess of net income. We also completed four acquisitions during 2012, including EECOL Electric, the largest in our history.
Over the last three years, we have doubled net income and generated a total shareholder return of 150%, exceeding the already healthy total shareholder return of over 10% CAGR since becoming a public company in 1999. We remain focused on our long-term objectives of growing sales faster than the market, delivering double- digit annual net income growth, providing superior return on invested capital, and generating strong free cash flow throughout the economic cycle.
I am pleased to report that the execution of our growth strategy is producing results that are meeting and exceeding these objectives. The strength of our WESCO team, the diversity of our portfolio, and the operating leverage of our business are clearly reflected in the profitable growth of our company. WESCO is now a bigger, stronger, faster, and more global company.
Strengthening Our Global Franchise
We look to play a consolidator role in the large, fragmented wholesale distribution industry in which
we operate. We have strengthened our portfolio by expanding our customer base, service capabilities, product lines, supplier relationships, and global footprint. We now have commercial operations in
18 countries and have shifted our business mix to higher growth end markets to provide greater balance through the business cycle. Our vision of being a global leader of supply chain solutions is becoming a reality as we advance our growth engines and invest in our business organically and through acquisitions. Last year,
we opened 13 new branches in the United States
and Canada, our second Lighting and Sustainability Solutions Center in Chicago, and our largest distribution center in Toronto.
We also completed the acquisitions of EECOL Electric, Conney Safety Products, RS Electronics, and Trydor Industries, which further solidified our strong electrical core and added new product and service categories to our company. Acquisitions have been a fundamental element of our growth strategy since we spun out of Westinghouse in 1994, and we have accelerated our pace over the last several years. Since June 2010,
we have completed eight acquisitions, which represent approximately $1.5 billion in revenues and over $1.50
of EPS accretion. We have a long track record of successfully identifying, closing, and integrating acquisitions, allowing us to consistently deliver on
our acquisition commitments.

2 WESCO International, Inc.
In 2013, cash redeployment will be directed primarily toward debt reduction and bringing our leverage
ratio back within the targeted range. The strong and consistent free cash flow generation characteristics of our business during all parts of the economic cycle support our ongoing acquisition strategy.
Accelerating One WESCO
One WESCO is accelerating across our company and is being marked by new customer wins, expanded customer relationships, stronger supplier alliances, and increased collaboration by our WESCO associates. Through our One WESCO initiatives, we are providing customers with the solutions they need to meet
their MRO, OEM, and capital project requirements.
One WESCO integrates our portfolio of products, services, and supplier relationships into comprehensive supply chain solutions for our customers and
their operations around the world. Last year, our One WESCO successes included many new and expanded relationships with:
n Global industrial companies for electrical and data communications products
n Utilities for integrated supply applications
n Global EPC contractors for construction materials
and capital project management
n Institutional customers and governmental agencies for general supplies and supply chain services
Our customer engagement and value creation activities are at an all-time high as we work to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and integrity of their operations and supply chains. We expect the pace
of outsourcing and consolidation in our industry to continue accelerating, which bodes well for large, disciplined, well-capitalized distributors like WESCO.
One WESCO progress in 2012 was also evidenced in the extraordinary effort demonstrated by our associates responding to Hurricane Sandy. Supplier partners
were engaged, resources were deployed, inventory
was repositioned, and our transportation network was realigned as WESCO associates worked around the clock to serve our customers and help our employees respond to this devastating storm. Over many years, we
have built a reputation as the “extra effort people.” This is best demonstrated when we provide first responder disaster management and storm restoration services to our customers.
Driving LEAN and Operational Excellence
We are celebrating the ten year anniversary of our LEAN journey this year. The application of LEAN to
the entire value chain, from our customers through to our suppliers, has been transformational. Although
ten years into this continuous improvement journey,
we see more opportunities to improve our business
and our customers’ operations and supply chains than ever before. We are executing against a targeted set of operational excellence initiatives, including marketing leadership for demand creation, pricing and sourcing effectiveness for margin expansion, and sales and service management for customer satisfaction. This
is “what” we are focused on, whereas, LEAN addresses the way in which we do things. It is “how” we execute. We’ve stayed the course, and LEAN is spreading organically throughout our company. Our investment in a comprehensive multi-lingual LEAN training structure, which covers five levels of belt certification, is paying dividends and has resulted in a record number of kaizen events being conducted inside our company and with customers in 2012. As we move forward, we recognize that we have only just begun our journey and consider LEAN to be a competitive differentiator in all that we do.
Investing in Talent and Sustaining Our High Performance Culture
Our people are the foundation of our high performance and continuous improvement culture, and we have
a highly committed, engaged, and diverse workforce that is focused on satisfying customers and finding
a better way every day. Talent management is about attracting, investing in, developing, and retaining the best global talent, and then building a high performance culture that inspires employee engagement. In
2012, we significantly increased our human resource investments for the third year in a row. As a result, we expanded our training and development programs within WESCO University, increased our college
   
recruiting efforts, expanded our mentoring program, and improved our employee reward and recognition programs.
We also conducted our second global employee engagement survey, which reflected a significant increase in the overall engagement score and improvement in all categories measured. We are pleased with these engagement survey results and are making good progress on our goal of being recognized as the employer of choice in the industries we serve.
It is also encouraging to be recognized for our diversity efforts. In 2012, we received the highest designation from 2020 Women on Boards for having at least 20% of our Board of Directors being comprised of women. In addition, the 2012 Catalyst Census of Fortune 500 Women Executive Officers and Top Earners recognized us for having at least 25% women executive officers. We are confident that the investments we are making in our people provide us with the required capacity to continue to grow and strengthen our market position. All of our talent management efforts are based on the belief that our people are our sustainable competitive advantage.
Outlook and Commitments
Our financial objectives are unchanged and remain focused on shareholder value creation. We also recognize that our consistent focus on sustainability, in the products and solutions we deliver to our customers and utilize in our own operations, creates shareholder value. In 2013, we will issue our first Sustainability Report outlining key programs, progress to date, and our plan for further reducing our environmental footprint and helping our customers do the same.
We are a bigger, stronger, faster, and more global Fortune 500 electrical and industrial wholesale distribution company, with a strong business portfolio and a high performance continuous improvement culture. We are playing offense and delivering strong results by taking advantage of the growth opportunities that exist in our large, fragmented industry. While we remain in a time of increased volatility and uncertainty, we continue to be laser focused on what we can control, that is our strategy, our investments, and our execution.
To our customers, thank you for your business and the opportunity to serve you. You have our commitment that we will listen, understand your needs and expectations, and do all that we can to provide you with superior value while we engage in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of your operations and supply chains.
To our employees, thank you for your continued dedication and One WESCO teamwork. You have our pledge to continue to provide a safe work environment where you can grow and succeed and be part of a winning One WESCO team.
To our suppliers, thank you for your partnership and support. Together, we will continue to combine our efforts and resources to provide industry-leading solutions for our customers.
To our shareholders, thank you for your vote of confidence through your investments in WESCO. We’re in the best shape we’ve ever been, and we are committed to consistently generating growth in shareholder value. As always, you will get our very best efforts.
