POWERING A NEW DAY 2014 INTEGRATED REPORT

LETTER

TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS
The theme of this year's integrated report is "Powering a New Day." When I talk to our stakeholders, most don't understand just how we do that. In fact, during many of these conversations, people are amazed at the true meaning of our vision statement: We Power Life. While they are familiar with us as the power and gas company, they don't realize how much more we do. We power job creation and economic growth in our communities. We promote and help to develop a skilled and educated workforce, not only for our company, but also for the communities we serve. And we take an active role in cleaner air and water and regional resiliency. On each of those dimensions, we delivered strong results in 2014 and took steps to enhance our long-term performance. You probably know we provide electricity and natural gas, but think what that means. Whether you are one of our 2.8 million utility customers in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, or you live in a community served by one of our Entergy Wholesale Commodities power plants, we provide the power that lets you talk on your smartphone or watch your TV, and we deliver natural gas to heat homes and run appliances. We power homes, businesses, neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. We power small towns and big cities. Our customers expect power and natural gas to be available reliably and on demand. That means we must continually invest in and modernize our fleet, strengthen our reliability and comply with new regulatory requirements. In 2014, we delivered strong operational performance in both our utility and EWC businesses. We also took steps to strengthen our ability to deliver reliable power and natural gas over the long term.

POWERING A NEW DAY 2014 INTEGRATED REPORT

LETTER

In our utility business, we developed new long-range supply plans, and we are engaged with customers, communities and regulators on the details of those plans. In 2014, we placed Ninemile 6 in service ahead of schedule and under budget, and we announced an agreement to acquire Union Power Station. Both are clean, fuel-efficient natural gas-fired resources. We also announced several transmission projects in 2014 and early 2015 in Louisiana and Texas, including the Lake Charles transmission project. One of our largest projects ever, the Lake Charles project will move power efficiently and reliably into southern Louisiana, a region with the highest projected job growth in the state. We also developed an accelerated gas pipe replacement program to replace about 100 miles of pipe in Baton Rouge, La., over the next 10 years. In 2014, we restored power quickly and safely following major storms in Arkansas and Mississippi, a critical component of reliability. For the second year in a row, Entergy utilities were the top five performers in proactive outage communications, according to J.D. Power. And all our utilities improved by several points in the annual J.D. Power residential customer satisfaction survey in 2014. In our EWC business, strong operational performance across our nuclear fleet in 2014 resulted in a 91 percent capacity factor, up from 89 percent in 2013. That means we were able to provide more power at a competitive cost to wholesale power markets in the Northeast and Midwest. We are engaged with key stakeholders to advance the license renewal process for Indian Point Energy Center, a nuclear plant that provides safe, low-cost and reliable power with on-site fuel while benefiting the environment. We expect license renewal to be a multi-year process during which we will continue to operate Indian Point safely, securely and reliably. Workforce safety is critical to providing reliable power, and our long-standing goal is to achieve an accident-free work environment. After delivering a record year for employee safety in 2013, our safety performance fell short in 2014. When we recognized the downward performance trend during the year, we instituted hazardrecognition programs and reinforced the use of human performance tools. By year-end, accident rates dropped significantly. We'll continue these and other efforts because workforce safety is a fundamental driver of our business performance and always a top priority at Entergy. We also power life by helping our local economies to grow, creating thousands of new jobs in the process. Our utilities provide power at low rates--about 20 percent below the national average across all classes--and that's an important consideration for companies selecting a new location for their operations. Continuing to manage costs is a priority for us, because that helps keep rates low. We completed our first year of operation in MISO, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc., and the MISO-driven customer savings are proving to be greater than we projected. We also work proactively with state and local leaders to attract new industries to the regions served by our utilities. We help identify potential sites, assist in permitting and provide online tools to streamline the development process. We do all this because economic growth builds our communities and drives sales growth for our utilities, which in turn helps us maintain rate stability, fund investments in our fleet and earn our authorized returns on our investments. We have been very successful in promoting economic development, and that success continued in 2014. We achieved

weather-adjusted retail sales growth of 2.3 percent, driven primarily by industrial sales growth of 5 percent. We believe the diverse industrial base in the Gulf South, including chemicals, primary metals, wood products and petrochemicals, will deliver significant utility sales growth through 2017. We always power life with an eye on the future. We engage with our regulators and stakeholders to ensure reliable and affordable power and natural gas will be readily available for years to come. In our utility business, we engage with regulators to secure rate mechanisms, such as formula rate plans and specific recovery riders, which enable us to recover costs faster and more efficiently. That, in turn, helps us maintain investor confidence and access capital markets to fund investments to modernize our fleet and enhance our reliability. In 2014, the Mississippi Public Service Commission authorized a new formula rate plan as well as solar projects and economic development incentives, which meet customer and community needs while strengthening Entergy Mississippi's financial position. The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved rider recovery for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana's accelerated gas pipe replacement program. Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana began the first year of their latest three-year formula rate plan, which includes a mechanism to bring investments like Ninemile 6 into rates upon completion. Entergy New Orleans promptly began rider recovery for costs associated with Ninemile 6. Entergy Texas completed a rate case and became the first utility in Texas to use a distribution rider to improve its financial position and flexibility. And the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved a modest increase in the Entergy Arkansas rate case rehearing. In our wholesale generation business, we are engaged with regulators and stakeholders to address long-term market design issues in the Northeast that have the potential to produce greater price volatility, and in the extreme, a less reliable system. These issues have implications for the continued operation of critical generating resources in the region. At the end of 2014, Vermont Yankee employees removed Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station from the grid after 42 years of safe, secure and reliable operations. We retired the unit for economic reasons due in part to the market design flaws. We are advocates for market structures that fairly compensate existing generators for benefits they provide in terms of system reliability and economic and environmental sustainability. And we work to prepare for whatever the future may bring. We proactively manage all types of risk related to our business. From short-term fluctuations in wholesale power prices to long-term risks posed by climate change and poverty, we have strategies in place to help mitigate risks that could adversely impact Entergy and our stakeholders. We hedge forward generation from our EWC fleet to mitigate wholesale power price volatility. In 2014, we captured significant upside through our hedging strategies and the close coordination of our commercial teams and plant operation teams, which ensured critical units were available when needed. We invest in clean generation like Ninemile 6 and the planned Union Power Station acquisition to help manage the risk of increased environmental regulation. We invest in wetlands restoration to mitigate risks associated with extreme weather events. In 2014, Entergy announced a $500,000 grant to The Nature Conservancy to restore

2014 KEY ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Utility
 We placed Ninemile 6 in service ahead of schedule and under budget.  We announced an agreement to acquire Union Power Station at an attractive price.  We completed our first year of operation in MISO and expect customers to realize more MISO-driven savings than originally expected.  All our utilities improved by several points in the annual J.D. Power residential customer satisfaction survey.

EWC
 We achieved a 91 percent capacity factor at our nuclear fleet, up from 89 percent in 2013.  We captured significant value for our owners through our hedging strategies when Northeast power prices spiked in early 2014.  We successfully transitioned Vermont Yankee to a SAFSTOR organization after 42 years of safe, secure and reliable operations.  We received a favorable ruling from a New York State appellate court related to license renewal for Indian Point.

forests and wetlands in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. We also share our analyses of climate change risks and potential responses with our utility customers to reduce the impact of extreme weather events on their businesses and ours. And we invest in poverty solutions to address the financial risk posed by the high number of people living in poverty in the four states served by Entergy utilities. Our Super Tax Day program, which was named the 2014 Best Economic Empowerment program by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, helps lowincome customers apply for the federal Earned Income Tax Credit and has resulted in $100 million returned to 58,000 Entergy customers since 2009. We power life for our communities through our corporate giving because our sustained growth depends on healthy, vibrant communities. In addition to poverty solutions and environmental programs, our corporate giving is focused on strengthening education. It's not just that every child deserves a good education. Communities need strong public education systems to attract economic growth and businesses like Entergy need an educated workforce to grow. Entergy has invested nearly $41 million in education since 2005. In 2014, we provided grants to community colleges in Arkansas and Louisiana to help build a skilled workforce to fill the jobs created by industrial growth in the region. And we worked with Posse Scholars in New Orleans to help prepare selected high school students for college. Within Entergy, our talent management strategies support the development and education of our employees to ensure they have the ability to meet the goals they have for themselves and their families. And we have targeted strategies to support key demographic groups, such as actively participating in events to recruit men and women who have served our country in the military. While we power life for Entergy employees in many ways, our employees power life for our company and our stakeholders. Entergy employees--the most dedicated, conscientious group of people I know--work diligently every day to keep the power on. And they do such a good job that most people rarely give it a thought. By ensuring the power is on every day and natural gas is delivered continuously, our employees drive our success as a company. In 2014, we continued to transform our organization because we need engaged, empowered employees to achieve our goals and compete in a very dynamic industry. We largely completed a

companywide restructuring to reduce costs and refocus resources in areas that support utility growth and the long-term value of our EWC fleet. We identified specific leadership and employee practices in 2014 that are hallmarks of healthy, successful organizations and we are instilling these practices throughout our company. Organization transformation takes time and effort, but we are confident it will strengthen our ability to provide sustainable value to our stakeholders over the long term. We power life for our owners by delivering attractive returns on the investments they make in our business. We believe we must deliver industry-leading returns over the long term in order to attract the capital we need to invest in and grow our business. Short-term fluctuations in power prices affect our performance, but over the long term, consistent execution of our business strategies drives our ability to generate competitive returns to our owners. In 2014, Entergy delivered top-quartile total shareholder return, based on stock price performance and dividends, of 44.8 percent compared to a return of 28.9 percent for the Philadelphia Utility Index. We benefited from both favorable market conditions and strong execution of our business strategies. We see significant capacity for stakeholder value creation in powering life through our existing businesses. Our utilities are located in the Gulf South, a region experiencing strong industrial development, and our EWC assets play a critical role in the regions they serve. We believe we can generate top-quartile returns for our owners by pursuing opportunities that advance our business strategies: grow the utility business and preserve optionality and manage risk at EWC. We continually look for ways to further our strategies, either through organic growth or transactions that offer attractive opportunities within our existing businesses. We set a standard that not only should transactions complement our strategies; they must also be executable and not distract us from the significant opportunities before us today. In addition to reinvesting in our utility and EWC businesses, our priority is to provide a dividend payout that is comparable to our industry peers. In 2014, our board established a target dividend payout range of 65 percent to 75 percent of earnings per share from the utility, parent and other segments. At the same time, we are committed to maintaining investment-grade ratings at our utilities and at Entergy Corporation. A strong financial and credit position gives us the financial flexibility to respond opportunistically to changing market conditions in ways that create sustainable value for our stakeholders. We power life. It's an awesome responsibility. It energizes me every day. And when I talk to friends and neighbors, community leaders and investors, and employees throughout the company, it seems to energize them as well. When people learn more about Entergy--from me or another stakeholder--then they are in a better position to engage with us, support our strategies and help drive our success. So talking about Entergy and how we power life helps us succeed as an organization, and quite honestly, it makes me feel great about our company, our employees and all we do to create value for our stakeholders.

I want to express my gratitude and thanks to our approximately 13,000 employees for the strong performance they delivered in 2014. I remain in awe of their spirit, determination and commitment to a job well done. I also want to thank our board of directors for their guidance, especially Stew Myers, who will retire from our board in 2015. Stew literally wrote the book, the finance textbook we all used in graduate school. We are all better for his time on the board. His knowledge and insights informed our plans and strategies and will help create value for our stakeholders for years to come. We also recently welcomed two new board members, Patrick Condon and Karen Puckett, who both joined the board in March. Pat's expertise in accounting and auditing and Karen's executive leadership experience at a company undergoing transformational change will enrich the board and provide valuable guidance for management as we pursue opportunities and challenges in the coming years. Under the direction of our board and the Entergy leadership team, our company continues to execute, anticipate and adapt in very dynamic market conditions. With their expertise and dedication, I believe the future of our company is in excellent hands. We power life in many ways because it makes good business sense for our company and creates value for our stakeholders. But it's about much more than dollars and cents. We power life in many ways because it's the right thing to do and our employees deserve to work at a company that holds that ideal. Most importantly, we power life because the customers we serve are our families, friends and neighbors, and the communities we serve are our homes. It is personal for us--it defines the spirit and character of our company and the men and women who work here. That is the true meaning of We Power Life, and yes, it is amazing.
