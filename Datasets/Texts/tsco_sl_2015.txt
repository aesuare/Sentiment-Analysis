NET SALES
($ IN BILLIONS)

NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE

2015 was a year of both successes and challenges for Tractor Supply Company. We opened 114 stores across the United States and grew our square footage by 8%. We increased our supply chain capacity with the addition of two mixing centers and a new distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona. Nearly 1,600 team members joined the Tractor Supply team through new positions in our stores, our distribution centers and our Store Support Center. We increased sales 9% to a record of more than $6.2 billion, increased diluted earnings per share 13% to $3.00, and returned $395.8 million to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase programs. We did face some challenges late in the year, which resulted in fourth quarter sales and net income growth below our expectations. The unprecedented warm weather throughout most of the country in the latter part of the fourth quarter resulted in weak demand for cold-weather products. While the geographic dispersion of our stores provides some insulation from isolated weather events, the record warm temperatures in November and December and the impact on cold-weather categories was simply too much to overcome. However, we were able to offset some of the weather challenges through strong sales of everyday basic items and disciplined inventory management and allocation practices. Throughout the year, our dedicated team members delivered on our commitment to be the most dependable supplier of basic maintenance products for the rural lifestyle. Our customers responded by continuing to shop Tractor Supply for those basic needs, and we again experienced four quarters of year-over-year comparable store transaction count growth. Our team members in the stores, Store Support Center, Merchandise Innovation Center and distribution centers, once again, did an amazing job of focusing on our customers, executing the business model and delivering great products and legendary customer service. As we have grown over the past 78 years, we have experienced many changes at Tractor Supply Company. One thing that has not changed is our passion for doing whatever it takes to take care of our customers. I believe we have one of the best teams in retail, and the number of customer comments and letters I personally receive are a testament to that passion. It makes me proud to be part of the Tractor Supply team. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for taking this journey with us. Together, we will work hard and do "whatever it takes" to serve our customers and grow our business profitably and responsibly.
