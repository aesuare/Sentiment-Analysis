 Letter to Shareholders
Investing for the Future
When Spirit AeroSystems was created five years ago, in connection with the sale by Boeing of its Kansas and Oklahoma operations to an investor group headed by Onex, we structured the company to manage through the expected ups and downs of aerospace business cycles. Within our first year we began acquiring skills and facilities that enhanced our long-term growth plan. We sought new business and new customers.
As a result, we have increased production every year. We have grown from a company with sales of $3.2 billion in 2006 to nearly $4.1 billion in 2009. While maintaining our core business with Boeing and Airbus, we continue to win new commercial aviation work, have diversified into business and regional jets, and have added pure military development platforms and military derivatives of commercial airplanes.
  In 2009, we were affected by challenges experienced in both commercial and general aviation business. But despite challenges on development programs and the cancellation of a new program, 2009 brought much for us to celebrate, including first flights in several key development programs, completion of new facilities, and a strong team that remains intact even as other companies have laid off thousands of employees.
Maintaining a Stable Base
Spirit is managing through the current economic uncertainty in part by focusing on our core business, nurturing our relationships with long-term customers, and meeting delivery schedules. At the same time, we have
Jeff Turner, President and Chief Executive Officer
worked hard to keep our labor force intact, so that we’ll be prepared to respond when our customers need us and when the market improves.
Spirit’s exclusive long-term agreements with Boeing and Airbus for large commercial aerostructures and compon- ents are our primary sources of revenues. Approximately 85 percent and 11 percent of our net revenues are generated from sales to Boeing and Airbus, respectively.
Our 75-year legacy as part of Boeing was manifested in key long-term contracts we secured with Boeing on the B737, B747, B767, and B777 programs as part of the divestiture agreement in 2005. We also became a significant supplier to Airbus through our acquisition of

  the aerostructures division of BAE Systems (Operations) Limited in April 2006. Our design and build capabilities in composites have led to significant new work, notably the Airbus A350 XWB program.
We manufacture aerostructures
for every Boeing commercial
aircraft currently in production,
including the majority of the
airframe content for the B737.
The B737 now known as the
737 Classic was first produced
in 1968 and was substantially
reengineered in August 1996 as
the Next-Generation 737. To date, more B737s have been produced than any other major commercial aircraft in history.
In 2009, Spirit achieved two significant milestones on the B737 program. In March, the company delivered its 6,000th B737 fuselage, a number that included 3,132 Classic units and 2,868 Next-Generation units. In November, Spirit delivered the 3,132nd Next-Generation fuselage, a milestone that vividly demonstrates Spirit’s increased production efficiencies and capacity. It took over three decades to deliver 3,132 Classic fuselages, from 1967 to 2000, and less than half that time to reach the same number of B737 Next-Generation fuselages.
Spirit achieved these production efficiencies and reduced cycle times by instituting process improvements such
as Lean manufacturing, designing for manufacturing, and use of Spirit Exact (including determinate assembly practices) – improvements that also reduced costs, increased productivity, and improved quality and safety for both workers and end users of the aircraft.
Our efforts to maintain a stable work force continue, with no layoffs in 2009 as a result of economic pressures. We place great trust in our employees – their skills are the keystone of our continuing success. Despite program delays, the continuing effects of the 2008 Boeing machinists’ strike, and other stresses that affected pro- duction in 2009, we were able to redeploy employees and retain important skills we will need when the aero- space industry recovers from the economic downturn.
Managing Global Growth
Spirit is growing in two ways: by acquiring new business from both existing and new customers; and by increasing our operational capacity to accommodate these new work packages in strategic locations that best meet both company and customer needs.
As expected in our current economic environment, 2009 growth was modest compared with prior years. However, we did capture some significant new work packages:
n In January 2009, Spirit was selected to build fuselages for P-8I long-range maritime reconnaissance and anti- submarine warfare aircraft being developed by Boeing for the Indian Navy. The P-8I is a variant of the P-8A Poseidon being developed for the U.S.
Navy by an industry team that includes Spirit. All eight of the P-8I aircraft in the contract are scheduled to be delivered by 2015.
n In June, Spirit was selected to design and build the pylon for the Bombardier CSeries regional commercial
  The first flight of the Boeing B787 “Dreamliner” took place on December 15, 2009. Spirit is a major supplier to the program, building the composite forward fuselage, pylon, wing fixed leading edge, and the moveable leading edge. The factory and workers are ready for production ramp-up once flight testing is completed.
 jet. This family of single- aisle commercial aircraft
is designed for the 100-
to 149-seat market. The work package for both
the CS100 and CS300 aircraft models includes systems, strut-to-wing hardware, and an aft fairing package. The aircraft is expected to enter into service in 2013.

     We seek to emulate our success with Boeing and Airbus by establishing long-term customer relationships on long- cycle projects that provide Spirit with significant future work opportunities. Our backlog currently has a value
of $28 billion. More than 80 percent of our backlog is for aircraft programs
that are either in pre- production stages or in the first half of their expected lifecycle.
As these programs mature, we anticipate that our backlog will account for significant new revenues over many years to come. (See the chart on pages 10-11.)
As part of an industry team led by Boeing, Spirit builds the fuselage, airframe tail sections, and struts of the P-8A Poseidon anti-submarine aircraft. The plane is a military derivative of the Next Generation B737-800. Spirit delivered its first fuselage to Boeing in early 2008, and first flight occurred in April 2009.

  Wing Systems Segment
The Spirit AeroSystems Wing Systems Segment produces wings, wing assemblies, and flight control surfaces for large commercial aircraft and regional and business jets. Customers include Boeing, Airbus, Israel Aerospace Industries, Gulfstream, and Hawker Beechcraft. The Wing Systems Segment has facilities on three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia). The newest facility, in Subang, Malaysia, opened in 2009. In addition to commercial work, the segment produces a variety of military components.
  In 2009, the Wing Systems Segment:
n Officially opened Spirit Malaysia with over 1,100 A320 composite panel assemblies having been completed and delivered from the facility
n Delivered the 4th Gulfstream G650 wing and the 3rd G250 wing
n Shipped the 13th B747-8 fixed leading edge wing sections
n Delivered the 6th set of spoilers and ailerons for the B747-8
n Made significant progress on the A350 wing component development
n Delivered the 500th B777 fixed leading edge
n Delivered the 1,300th ship set of A320 wing components

We are pleased that four product lines in our backlog had successful first flights in 2009:
n Boeing B787 “Dreamliner” – The Boeing B787’s
first flight was accomplished on December 15, 2009. Spirit is a major contributor to the aircraft, with contracts to build the forward fuselage, pylon, and the fixed and moveable leading edges on the wing. Spirit is prepared for full production mode once the program is ready
for ramp-up.
n Boeing Poseidon P-8A – Spirit is building the fuselage for this military derivative of the B737-800 for the U.S. Navy. The first test aircraft completed its first flight in April.
n Gulfstream G650 – The first flight of this ultra- large-cabin, ultra-long-range business jet occurred in November. Spirit designs and builds the aircraft’s wings in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The nacelle and thrust reverser for the Rolls-Royce BR725 engine, which powers the G650, are built in Wichita.
n Gulfstream G250 – Spirit also builds the wings for the G250 in Tulsa. The new, super mid-size G250 aircraft’s first flight was in December.
Spirit continues to build new facilities and add capacity as needed to accommodate new work. Two facilities opened in 2009:
n Spirit AeroSystems Malaysia Sdn Bhd – This 242,000-square-foot manufacturing facility opened in Subang, Malaysia, in early 2009. The facility produces a number of composite subassemblies, principally for Airbus single-aisle aircraft. Its first under-wing panel assembly was completed in March.
n Taikoo Spirit AeroSystems (Jinjiang) Composite Co. Ltd – This new MRO (maintenance, repair, and overhaul)
repair station in Jinjiang, China, is a joint venture with Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co. Ltd (HAECO), its subsidiary Taikoo (Xiamen) Aircraft Engineering Co. Ltd (TAECO), and other partners. The repair station provides repair services for aircraft operators across the Asia-Pacific region.
To accommodate work
on the Airbus A350 XWB, two additional building projects are under way:
n North Carolina Business
Unit – We have made
significant progress on
construction of a new
580,000-square-foot
manufacturing facility that will initially house our work package on the new Airbus A350 XWB program.
We anticipate A350 production beginning in Kinston, North Carolina, in mid-2010. The first work statement is the composite center fuselage section, a structure 65 feet long and more than 20 feet in diameter. To accommodate transportation requirements, the unit will ship unassembled as composite panel sections.
n Assembly plant near Saint-Nazaire, France – The large A350 panel sections will ship from Kinston to Saint-Nazaire, France, for assembly into composite barrels for the A350 center fuselage section before delivery to Airbus. We broke ground on the 17,644-square-foot facility in October 2009.

 targeting Financial Performance Improvement
The year 2009 brought continued strong demand for our core products, and we achieved important milestones in both
core business and development programs. During the year
we faced challenges on new programs and cost pressures on our core programs. These issues emerged as we recovered from the machinists’ strike at Boeing early in the year, and as we began strategically redeploying internal resources to programs with increasing volumes.
Full-year 2009 revenues grew
8 percent to $4.079 billion, up
from $3.772 billion in 2008,
as total deliveries for large
commercial aircraft increased in
2009. Full-year 2009 operating
income decreased to $303
million, down from $406 million
in 2008, due primarily to charges
recorded in the second quarter and unfavorable contract adjustments in 2009.
Net income for the full-year 2009 was $192 million, or $1.37 per fully diluted share, compared with $265 million, or $1.91 per fully diluted share, for 2008.
As we move into 2010, produc- tivity improvements across our core business remain a high priority, as is a continued focus
on execution and managing design evolution for new programs. Above all, we will strive to continue meeting customer requirements and generating long- term value for our shareholders.
Looking to the Future
Although the global economic downturn has had a significant impact on commercial aviation, we are confident that ours is a long-term growth industry that will eventually recover. We believe we have taken the necessary steps to ensure Spirit will be producing top-quality aerospace structures and components for decades to come.
Everything in our approach is an investment for our future. As we enter our sixth year as a
business, we move forward with the continued trust of our customers, a renewed commitment to improving processes and products, and confidence in the strength and capabilities of our work force.

    2009 Business Segment Operating Income
Spirit’s backlog at the end of 2009 was $28 billion, down 12 percent from year- end 2008, as 2009 Airbus and Boeing deliveries exceeded orders.
Cash flow from operations was an outflow of ($14) million for the full-year 2009, compared with an inflow of $211 million for the full-year 2008. This
First flight for Gulfstream’s new G650 ultra-large-cabin, ultra-long- range business jet was in November 2009, and first flight for the G250 super mid-size business jet was in December. Spirit builds wings for both models in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Spirit’s Wichita facility builds the nacelle and thrust reverser for the Rolls-Royce BR725 engine, the selected engine for the G650.
