    To Our Shareholders
This year marks the 20 year anniversary of Dollar Tree Stores and the excitement of our business continues to build! Growing from a single store in 1986, Dollar Tree will end this year with over 3,000 stores across 48 states, a national retailer in every sense and the leader in extreme value retailing. Much has changed in the business environment over the past 20 years and while economic factors ebb and flow, the compet- itive landscape becomes crowded and customer tastes and preferences continue to change, at Dollar Tree, we believe there is one constant — everybody loves a bargain! Over the past 20 years, we have developed product skills, world-wide sourcing relationships, effective logistics capabilities, retail technology and operational efficiency that will enable Dollar Tree to continue providing great value for years to come. Our core competency is delivering value — value to our customers and to our shareholders.
For our customers, we deliver value through a combination of great products and conveniently-located stores. Stores that are bright, friendly and fun to shop. We strive to thrill our customers every day, exceeding their expectations with products that represent sur- prising value. This is what we call the “WOW factor”, and this is what keeps them coming back.
For our shareholders, we deliver value in many ways. With a solid balance sheet, we have funded growth through internally generated capital, making prudent investments in infrastructure to support profitable business expansion. We remain focused on long-term profitability and return on investment. Strong financial controls reflect our core values of honesty, integrity and transparency — and these values are steadfast.
Our Products
Of course, our merchandise is the star of the Dollar Tree extreme value proposition. Every Dollar Tree store offers a wide assortment of variety merchandise — from housewares to hardware to party goods, health and
beauty care, stationery, household cleaning
supplies,
candy and seasonal items and more — all at incredible values!
Our merchandising strategy
provides a mix of branded product,
including well-known national brands, popular regional brands and exclusive Dollar Tree brands. An ever- changing mix of exciting high value closeouts rounds out the assortment. We have become a destination for seasonal décor and party supplies. You can pay more but you can’t buy better gift bags and wrap supplies. Our customers love our style and value! Additionally, in our larger store format, we have increased our assortment of basic products, things you need everyday, providing new and existing customers a reason to shop with us more frequently. We can now offer more of the products our customers need, like household cleaning supplies and health & beauty care, in addition to the great prod- ucts they want, like toys and stationery. The expansion of our basics continues to provide our customers more reasons to shop for great values at Dollar Tree.
Our Progress on 2005 Initiatives
Successful retailing is always dependent on quality store locations and market share expansion. At the end of 1986, Dollar Tree operated five stores. In the first half of 2006, we will celebrate the opening of our 3,000th Dollar Tree store — a great record of growth in our first twenty years. In 2005, we opened 232 new stores with over 60 percent opening in the first half of the year. These stores averaged 12,400 square feet, a size that offers optimum productivity. This size store is ideal from the customers’ perspective because it allows

them to see a full display of merchandise in an open and bright shopping environment,
while keeping their shopping trip quick and convenient. As we open new stores, we will continue
to apply a more rigorous analytical process to identify optimal locations to maximize sales and Return on Invested Capital.
We also launched our Metropolitan store initiative in 2005. This initiative, including stores in Long Island and the greater New York and New Jersey areas, is yielding very positive results. Although these markets are more expensive to operate, and take longer to find the optimum real estate, they have the potential to lead the company in terms of sales productivity and four-wall contribution, as our experience has demon- strated so far.
In today’s increasingly cashless society, offering consumers a broader range of payment options is essential. Accepting payment types other than cash often results in increased transaction size and store productivity. In 2005, we dramatically expanded our acceptance of debit card and electronic benefits trans- fer to over 70% of locations, and we plan to expand this to all of our stores in 2006. In addition, as we have added more basic product, we also now accept food stamps at over 200 of our locations.
Over the past few years, we have made significant investments in infrastructure, which are contributing
to our improved performance. As an example, the increased visibility provided by our Point-of-Sale and back office systems and a greater use of auto replenish- ment on basics allows our stores to place more focus and energy into moving product to the sales floor faster. The result is a cleaner, more efficient store with less inventory in the backroom. Our inventory turns increased in 2005, and we ended the year with 12 percent less inventory

per store. This was made possible in part by putting in place an information systems infrastructure that allows us to better anticipate consumer demand and deliver product quickly and efficiently.
Our Priorities for 2006
Our number one priority for 2006 is to grow the top line. As in the past, we will do this through a combina- tion of new stores and improved store productivity. Long term, we have the opportunity to grow to more than 5,000 stores in the U.S. alone.
In February of this year, we announced our intent to purchase stores and related assets of Deal$-Nothing Over a Dollar chain, from SUPERVALU INC. Under the terms of the acquisition, which was completed at the end of March, we acquired 138 Deal$ stores, including store assets, leasehold rights and certain intellectual property for $30.5 million in cash, plus approximately $22.2 million of inventory.
Deal$ stores offer a wide assortment of quality general merchandise, contemporary goods and every- day consumables. The stores average 11,000 gross square feet and operate in sixteen states in the Midwest and Southeast regions.
We are excited about this acquisition for several key reasons:
• It provides us the opportunity to expand our presence in the Midwest and Southeast regions;
• Deal$ is a strong, recognized brand, and we will continue to operate these stores under the Deal$ banner;
• The acquisition gives us a platform, separate from Dollar Tree stores, to begin testing new products and merchandising concepts, including higher price points in some of the newly acquired locations, without disrupting the single price point model in our Dollar Tree stores;
• Dollar Tree has existing logistics capacity to service all of these acquired stores efficiently, with no additional capital expenditure.
Every year builds on the successes of the previous year while looking ahead to the challenges of the future. This year is no different. In 2006 we intend to build on last year’s progress made in re-engineering our real estate processes. We will continue to open stores earlier in the year, focusing on the optimal store size of about 12,000 square feet, while continuing to apply rigorous criteria for determining locations. We will also continue to leverage our investments in infra- structure and systems. In a nutshell, our goal for this year is to grow our top line through new stores and improved store productivity while setting the stage for consistent earnings growth and improved operating margins over the long term.
Our People — the Foundation of our Success
None of our goals can be achieved without the collab- orative efforts of our 37,000 dedicated associates, who deliver value to our customers every day. They are the human element behind each sale. Every day, Dollar Tree associates throughout the organization give of themselves to make sure that each customer is pleased with their shopping experience and that they leave the store with the intent to return and shop at Dollar Tree again and again. They are the heart and soul of this organization and their efforts and creativity are the keys to our success and growth. We are grateful to our associates and recognize their huge contribution to the success of Dollar Tree. Our success is measured by the success of our people.
It has been a great 20 years for Dollar Tree Stores but the best is yet to come!
