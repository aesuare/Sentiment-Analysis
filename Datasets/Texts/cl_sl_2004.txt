        Dear Colgate Shareholder...
An Excellent Year For Colgate’s Top-Line, Strong Market Share Gains Worldwide
    “Colgate is capitalizing on strong top-line momentum as we enter 2005. This very positive trend combined with our new global restructuring program bodes well for strong profitable growth going forward. We remain focused on our high-margin core businesses and believe we are taking the right measures to invest strategically for profitable
Q. Colgate achieved strong sales and unit volume growth in 2004. Do you expect this positive momentum to continue into 2005?
A. Reuben Mark: Colgate’s sales and volume did grow very strongly in 2004. Global
sales increased 7.0% and global unit volume from continuing businesses grew 6.5%, the strongest unit volume growth in six years. We are especially encouraged that every operat- ing division achieved solid volume increases and that growth momentum strengthened throughout the year with global unit volume from continuing businesses building to 9.0% in the fourth quarter. These positive results are reflected in rising market shares for Colgate brands all around the world. For example, Colgate’s toothpaste market shares are up in more than 100 countries around the world, including such competitive markets as the U.S., Mexico, China and Russia.
As we enter 2005, Colgate’s pipeline is very full with innovative new products planned for launch in all of our core categories. This bodes well for 2005 to be another year of top- line strength for Colgate.
Q. Colgate’s advertising spending was up significantly in 2004, both in absolute dollars and as a percent of sales. Will this level of spending continue in 2005? A. Bill Shanahan: Advertising is an important business-building activity, and we are com- mitted to using this marketing tool to aggressively support new products and existing brands. Spending levels required to maintain market share have increased around the world. In 2004, Colgate’s advertising spending rose 10% to an all-time record level. In 2005, we expect our commercial spending to continue at competitive levels, including heavy increases in media.
This spending will be carefully targeted to support new products in the Company’s core, high-margin categories and in key competitive markets including the U.S., China, Russia, India, Mexico and Brazil.
This kind of effective, sustained advertising is essential for continued growth, and we are pleased with the acceleration of our market shares and excellent unit volume growth that has followed the stepped-up spending.
Q. Please comment on the Company’s 2004 profit trends.
A. Reuben Mark: After many years of strong growth, profits in 2004 were affected by sev- eral factors, including a heightened competitive environment requiring increased levels of commercial investment and steep increases in raw and packing material prices. These additional costs more than offset sizable savings generated by the Company’s ongoing “Funding the Growth” programs. Rather than cut back on critical marketing and promo- tional activities, management chose to continue to spend at an increased pace. We strongly believe this was the best approach for the Company’s medium and long-term busi- ness performance. The strong volume growth and solid market share gains seen through- out the year are evidence that these actions are already paying off.
In addition, profits in 2004 include a $48 million aftertax charge related to the 2004 Restructuring Program announced in the fourth quarter.
growth.”
Reuben Mark
 “We are carefully targeting increased commercial investment to support our priority businesses in key high-potential markets around the world. Our stepped- up advertising spending is already paying off in higher market shares and new category leadership positions around the world. With our sharp focus on new products, we remain dedicated to accelerat- ing innovation and furthering our leadership positions worldwide.”

Despite a challenging year, we are pleased that gross profit margin grew more than expected, reaching a record 55.1% for the year.
This is not the first time we have confronted difficult business conditions. As in the past, Colgate is extremely focused on our proven business strategies and on emerging from these challenging periods even stronger than before.
Q. How will the 2004 Restructuring Program announced in December 2004 contribute to growth and profitability? When do the projected savings begin? A. Reuben Mark: Colgate’s 2004 Restructuring Program, a four-year restructuring and business-building plan, is well under way and will begin to generate important savings in the latter part of 2005. The program is designed to accelerate growth and generate addi- tional savings throughout the income statement in a number of ways, with almost 100 individual initiatives included in the plan.
Overall, we are moving toward a truly global supply chain with fewer, more sophisti- cated global and regional state-of-the-art manufacturing centers. Business support func- tions will be centralized into regional and global shared-service centers with larger and more effective sales and marketing organizations in key markets.
We expect the 2004 Restructuring Program to result in cumulative charges of between $550 and $650 million aftertax and to generate annual aftertax savings of approximately $40 million to $50 million starting in 2005 and reaching $250 million to $300 million aftertax annually by 2008. These savings will be used to further increase mar- keting spending, accelerate innovation and strengthen profitability. We are confident in this program, and in 2006 we expect to increase our goal of gross margin improvement to 75–125 basis points annually.
We expect the plan’s initiatives to help ensure continued solid worldwide growth in sales, unit volume and earnings per share.
Q. Providing a steady stream of innovative new products has been key to Colgate’s success. Please elaborate on the Company’s innovation strategy.
A. Bill Shanahan: Approximately 40% of total Company sales in 2004 came from new products launched within the past five years. These new products have led to strong market share growth and market leadership in core categories around the world. For example, in 2004 Colgate Max Fresh and Colgate Simply White toothpastes not only
brought innovation to the category but also are contributing to record market shares in the U.S. We expect to continue keeping the pipeline full, especially in our high-margin categories of Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition.
As successful as we have been, we are never satisfied. To continue our innovation, we are expanding and upgrading new product groups both within and outside the U.S., and we are strengthening our consumer and in- store shopper insight efforts that help us determine what products will appeal to consumers. At the same time, we are increasing R&D spending in key categories such as Oral Care and Pet Nutrition, and are partnering with the scientific community to generate further ideas.

Dear Colgate Shareholder (continued)
Q. What is Colgate’s growth strategy in emerging markets?
A. Bill Shanahan: Emerging markets with their large and growing populations offer excel- lent opportunities for Colgate. We will continue to increase our support behind our brands in these areas that offer so much potential. In fact, we are already seeing results from our stepped-up investment. In China, for example, Colgate maintained its leadership of the toothpaste market during the year with its national market share reaching 33% in Decem- ber, and in Russia we achieved excellent market share gains in toothpaste, toothbrushes and deodorants.
Colgate’s long-time presence in the developing world is a distinct competitive advan- tage. Local management has the know-how and experience needed to reach consumers in these vast markets with a wide range of quality products. Smaller sizes, refill packs and low-cost formulas are just some of the ways Colgate helps make products more affordable and desirable. Also key to our growth strategy in these regions is supporting our brands with educational and consumption-building programs that increase product usage.
Q. How has the recent GABA acquisition in Europe strengthened your global Oral Care business?
A. Bill Shanahan: GABA, a leading European oral care company, is a great strategic fit for Colgate because of its strong relationships with the dental profession and the academic community, and its strength in the important pharmacy distribution channel. When com- bined with Colgate’s strong mass market presence, market shares in toothpaste in the region now exceed 33%, further strengthening Colgate’s category leadership.
This is just the beginning. Oral Care, as we have stated, is a high-margin priority busi- ness for Colgate, and we see much more opportunity for additional growth, including geographic expansion of GABA products into Eastern Europe and further leveraging GABA’s strong professional and academic relationships.
Q. What is Colgate doing to ensure its people have the skills and the tools they need to continue to succeed in today’s dynamic global workplace?
A. Reuben Mark: We are committed to investing in Colgate people. We place high prior- ity on offering a wide range of training and development opportunities for all employees to enable them to succeed and assure their strong performance. Each year, Colgate’s global curriculum is updated and expanded. Today, Colgate offers more than 150 courses teaching leadership and functional skills across all disciplines and at varying levels.
The courses are tailored to Colgate’s global business strategies and are taught by certified Colgate instructors who share best practices and emphasize business integrity. In addition to traditional classroom courses, training also takes place on the job and through e-learning.
Q. What is the Company’s outlook for 2005 and beyond?
A. Reuben Mark: We firmly believe that the fundamentals of our business are very
strong and our business strategy is sound. The top-line growth momentum seen in 2004 is continuing and our market shares are growing stronger and stronger around the world. We remain extremely focused on new product innovation in our core categories and are prepared to continue to spend aggressively to support our global brands. With the expected savings from the 2004 Restructuring Program and our ongoing “Funding the Growth” programs, we are optimistic that we will reach our profit expectations in 2005, and we believe we are back on track to return to double-digit earnings per share growth in 2006. I am confident that our historic success will continue.
Thank you,
Reuben Mark William S. Shanahan Chairman and Chief Executive Officer President
