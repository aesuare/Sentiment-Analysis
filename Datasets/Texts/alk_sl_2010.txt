To Our Shareholders
A LOOK BACK
As we look back on our record-setting year, I want to spend some time to reflect on the changes we've made over the past decade that made our performance in 2010 a reality. But first, let's take a look at some of our achievements from last year. S Alaska Air Group reported record earnings in 2010, resulting in a record 11.1 percent pretax profit margin, which is among the best in the industry. This year's results also represent our seventh consecutive year of profitability and we exceeded our 10 percent Return on Invested Capital goal, reporting 10.7 percent for 2010.

Both Alaska and Horizon reported record passenger load factors. As a result of our ability to quickly shift capacity to markets where our customers want to fly, our airplanes were fuller than they ever have been.

Alaska reported record on-time performance, with 87.6 percent of flights arriving on time during 2010 ­ the highest among the ten largest domestic carriers. We also reported record revenues of $3.8 billion, record free cash flow of nearly $350 million, and the lowest debt leverage we've had since 1999.

At the heart of these results are the 12,000 hardworking Alaska and Horizon employees who truly care about our company and provide outstanding service to our customers. Working together, we produced these great results and I am grateful to all of our people for their tremendous efforts. Our accomplishments have been noticed by others outside our company as well: S 2010 marked the third year in a row that Alaska was ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Traditional Network Carriers" by J.D. Power and Associates. Alaska was named the "Top-Performing Airline of the Year" by Aviation Week magazine in 2010, outranking global airline customer-service stalwarts such as Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific. The magazine highlighted our smaller size and independence as one of our biggest assets. Alaska was awarded the "On-Time Performance Service Award" among major North American airlines by FlightStats.com for our 2010 on-time performance. In January 2011, Air Transport World named Alaska the winner of the "2011 Airline Technology Leadership Award," citing our pioneering of RNP (Required Navigation Performance), our "Airport of the Future," and our Greener Skies Over Seattle project, among other notable accomplishments. Our Mileage Plan program was recognized as having the "Best Loyalty Credit Card" in North America at the Frequent Traveler Awards in 2010.

The success in 2010 reflects the efforts of the past decade as much as the last twelve months. In 2003, we embarked on a transformation plan that we called the "2010 Plan." In that plan, we envisioned a virtuous cycle that starts with engaged employees who deliver excellent customer service leading ultimately to sustained financial success. That success, in turn, allows us to grow our business. In that plan we set forth a number of ambitious objectives to define a great company, not just a great airline. Let me share some of those objectives with you. S First ­ safety. We aim to be consistently recognized as having best-in-class safety practices. In that vein, Alaska and Horizon received their ninth and eleventh consecutive Diamond Awards, respectively, from the FAA in 2010 for maintenance training excellence and both companies have developed robust vendor oversight programs.

Second ­ network. We've restructured our network to be more balanced seasonally and less affected by demand fluctuations in any one region. Our service to the Hawaiian Islands that we began 3 1/ 2 years ago now represents about 15 percent of our network. New Alaska Routes 2007 ­ 2011

Third ­ market-based compensation. Generous incentive plans enhance market-based compensation and align all employees around common financial and operational goals. Our employees earned an additional $92 million from these incentive plans in 2010 ­ which equates to more than one month's pay for every employee. Fourth ­ fleet. In 2008, we achieved our goal of a single fleet of efficient Boeing 737 aircraft at Alaska. And this year, Horizon will complete its transition to a single fleet of all Q400 aircraft in June. Fifth ­ growth. Air Group's capacity has grown by 18 percent since 2003 in contrast to overall domestic capacity, which has remained flat ­ and most importantly, our growth has been profitable. With the new fleet order of Boeing 737-900ER aircraft announced in January 2011, we will have the option to grow at a rate of 3 percent to 6 percent annually for many years, assuming economic conditions and fuel prices support that level of growth.

And finally ­ costs. Alaska's non-fuel unit costs have declined from 8.73 cents in 2001 to 7.85 cents in 2010. In fact, we reduced unit costs more than any other major domestic airline in 2010. However, we know we're not done. Customers want low fares, and to have low fares, we must have low costs.

A LOOK AHEAD
In 2011, we will make two major changes at Horizon. First, our transition to an all-Q400 fleet is becoming a reality as we are scheduled to be out of the remaining 13 CRJ-700 aircraft by June of this year. And second, effective January 1, we moved to an industry-standard capacity purchase model where Alaska purchases all of Horizon's capacity. We will phase out the Horizon external brand and put the Eskimo on the tail. This was a difficult decision because we recognize the strength of the Horizon brand in our home region ­ the Pacific Northwest ­ and our employees' pride in the 30-year-old brand. We believe that putting our resources behind a single brand will ultimately strengthen the Alaska brand, eliminate duplicate marketing efforts, increase efficiency and enhance our profitability.

2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010
$3.60 $4.34 $4.60 $5.76 $8.76 $11.55

In 2011, we will keep our focus on increasing revenues. In addition to tailoring capacity to match demand and optimizing our fare levels, we will continue to enhance our ancillary offerings, such as hotel and car bookings. Just last week, we rolled out a redesigned alaskaair.com Web site that will make booking your entire trip easier. And speaking of ancillary revenues, we've shown great improvement over the past several years in that area going from $3.60 per passenger in 2005 to $11.55 per passenger in 2010.

*** Many of the changes we made were difficult and required a lot of hard work. Because we made these difficult changes by working together with our people, we have an advantage over airlines that used bankruptcy to solve their problems and we're better prepared for whatever challenges the future may hold. The result is a solid foundation that has fundamentally improved the economics of our business while balancing the interests of all of our stakeholders by providing: S S Award-winning service and low fares for our customers; Secure careers for our employees who share in the company's success through generous incentive plans; and Sustained profitability and long-term returns for you, our shareholders.

We look forward to a prosperous future as we work together to build a great company that's known for taking care of its people, its customers, and its owners. We believe that our future is as bright as it's ever been. Sincerely,
