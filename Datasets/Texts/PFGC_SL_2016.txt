DEAR SHAREHOLDER

Fiscal 2016 was a productive year at Performance Food Group (PFG). We successfully completed an initial public offering listing our shares on the New York Stock Exchange and subsequently completed a secondary offering to investors in the midst of a volatile environment. At the same time our team remained intently focused on strategic initiatives for growth. Our annual results were fueled by momentum across our business, including strong independent case growth. Full-year net sales topped $16 billion, and gross profit topped $2 billion for the first time in our Company's history. Margin improvement growth resulted from the benefits of improved mix and operating leverage from strong sales growth and PFG's Winning Together program. These operational and financial results helped us generate a total shareholder return from October 1st through June 30th of 40.2%, far outpacing the S&P 500 return of 9.1%.
KEY FISCAL 2016 HIGHLIGHTS INCLUDE:

Most importantly, we have a great team focused on serving our customers, and I want to thank all of our associates and let them know how proud I am of their contributions to PFG this year. Thank you for your hard work and your commitment to our great company.
