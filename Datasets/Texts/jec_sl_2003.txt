Fiscal year 2003 started with great uncertainty with the economies of the Western World in a state of disarray and the threat of war in the Middle East. Today, the threat of war is gone and the outlook for 2004 is improved. In spite of the uncertain start, we had revenues of $4.6 billion and record net income of $128 million ($2.27 per share,
a 14.6 percent increase over 2002). Cash flow from operations during the year exceeded $147 million, which allowed us to pay down $73 million of debt and build our cash balances. Our year-end backlog of $7 billion was also a new record.

75 percent. Both rates are world-class and represent significant progress. However, we cannot rest on our laurels; we need to continually improve these rates. In the end, our goal is to totally eliminate accidents from the workplace.
Throughout 2003, our Refining, Federal Programs, and Pharmabio markets remained very strong and prospects were plentiful. Our Buildings and Infrastructure businesses continued to prosper, but weaker local economies in both the U.S. and the U.K. dampened prospects somewhat. As we move into 2004, however, many of these issues are resolving and these markets should improve. Our Chemicals, High-Technology, and Pulp & Paper markets stayed weak throughout 2003. These markets remain near the bottom of their cycles and while we were successful in winning work and gaining market share, prospects were still soft as we entered 2004.
Geographically, North America, Western Europe, and India/Singapore started slowly in the first half of 2003, but business improved as the year progressed and the political climate stabilized. All three of these regions look like they will be better during the course of 2004.
SAFETY
We worked hard to upgrade our safety program throughout 2003 and the results were gratifying. On a global basis, we improved our OSHA recordable rate by 20 percent. Even more significantly, our lost-time rate improved by

QUALITY
We focus a lot on delivering value to our clients, which we measure with our client survey process. Over the last decade, we have raised our average client survey scores from 73 percent to 85.4 percent. Last year alone we improved our client surveys another one percent, which is significant since a client survey score of 67 percent represents good performance in all 10 categories we measure.

                                        BOARD EVENTS
The Corporate Governance issues of the last few years have led to elevated scrutiny of all Boards of Directors and how they perform. We have always been pleased with our Board and its contribution to the success of our company. As the case has been for many years, the majority of our directors continue to be outside independent directors representing diverse backgrounds.
In 2003, Dr. Clay LaForce and Jim Rainey retired from our Board of Directors. Clay and Jim had been on our Board for 16 and 10 years, respectively, and made significant contributions to our growth over this period. We were very fortunate to be able to recruit Joe Bronson and Tom Niles as outside independent directors. Joe, currently CFO for Applied Materials, is a Certified Public Accountant who brings a strong financial background to our Board. Tom, currently President of the United States Council for International Business, brings a strong international background from his service as U.S. Ambassador to Canada, the European Union, and Greece. Both gentlemen have already made significant contributions to our business.
OUR CORE VALUES
We operate with a fundamental set of three Core Values, which will continue to guide us:
1. We Are Relationship-Based
2. Growth Is An Imperative
3. People Are Our Greatest Asset
These values drive our behavior and all of our major decision-making.
We Are Relationship-Based means that we focus on delivering superior value in all our dealings with clients, thus establishing a position of trust with them.
JOSEPH J. JACOBS, Chairman of the Board
Our goal is to delight our clients and leave them with the knowledge that we are a major contributor to their success. To do this, we must understand their business as well as they do; we must be flexible in our approach and adapt to the specific needs of our clients; and our people must understand that our success depends on each of us fulfilling our obligation to go beyond simply satisfying our clients.
Growth Is An Imperative drives us to focus on bottom-line growth of 15 percent a year, which is a long-term growth rate we have successfully sustained for some time. Focusing on this growth paradigm allows us to provide our clients with a broader array of services in more geographies. It also opens up a world of opportunity for our people to grow and to realize their potential.
People Are Our Greatest Asset is a key axiom for any services business. What we offer our people is a mutually beneficial opportunity—their skills, knowledge, contributions, innovations, etc., in exchange for exciting work, technical challenges, leadership development, and a dynamic and creative environment. We strive to be their employer of choice, remaining a part of our network rather than leaving us to go elsewhere. This relationship is more like a business partnership than an employer-employee relationship. It requires that we treat employees not as hired hands but as partners— sharing more information, more frequently, so they can make responsible decisions. It also obliges our employees to take responsibility for building our company, helping our clients succeed, and fulfilling their own career objectives.
We want to thank our employees, our shareholders, and our clients for their loyalty and support over the years. With this support, there is no limit to what we can accomplish together.
NOEL G. WATSON, Chief Executive Officer
