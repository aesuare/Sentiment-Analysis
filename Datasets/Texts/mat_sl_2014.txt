TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
By any measure, 2014 was – candidly – a challenging year for Mattel. Even as the global toy industry grew in 2014, we fell short of our own expectations, as well as those of our shareholders. The numbers tell the story. Mattel’s worldwide net sales declined
approximately 7%1. Lower sales, exacerbated by higher costs, resulted in earnings per share of $1.45, compared to $2.58 in 20132.
But, I want to assure you, we are not standing still. We are taking bold and aggressive steps to reignite momentum in 2015 and beyond. As Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mattel,
I am squarely focused on working with our talented team to revitalize the business. As we develop our go-forward plan, we are addressing the areas where we fell short in 2014, which we believe fall into three categories.
First, in a highly-competitive retail environment, our brands
and products were not sufficiently compelling to consumers. While some brands performed well, many did not, and product innovation was inconsistent across our portfolio. Moreover, our marketing efforts delivered mixed results and did not generate a lift in overall brand sales.
Second, 2014 brought one of the most competitive environments in the doll category we have seen in many years. Overall, the doll category accounts for about 40% of Mattel’s total business3, and our portfolio includes the top five most popular fashion doll properties in the world4. The doll category, however, did not show significant overall growth in 20145. And, as a result, the remarkable success of Disney’s FrozenTM franchise came at the expense of several of our brands, including Barbie®6.
Third, our retail execution did not meet our expectations. Our results were impacted by inventory overhang from 2013 and, against the backdrop of a more challenging retail environment we did not execute well in-store, resulting in a decline in retail support and shelf space productivity.
Clearly, we have a lot of work to do. But there is ample reason
to be optimistic about Mattel and our performance over the long term. Our unmatched portfolio of iconic brands, global scale and strong balance sheet give Mattel a unique and enviable position of leadership within the industry. The worldwide toy industry itself is strong and growing, having shown 4% annual growth last year7. And we benefit from world-class talent across every function of the company.

I am confident that Mattel has at its disposal every tool and resource necessary to maintain a strong leadership position within the toy industry. In 2015, we are taking a number of aggressive steps to deliver improved profitability throughout the business. These steps include:
• Driving innovation across our key brands, and in particular amongst those in the doll category;
• Developing and implementing a rigorous sales plan – both in-store and online – to improve customer service and retail performance;
• Accelerating our efforts to better position Fisher-Price® as a child development brand; and
• Focusing our efforts on the most significant international market opportunities for our brands.
Additionally, through the Funding Our Future initiative, we will continue to reduce costs throughout the business, reinvesting the savings to support our efforts around restoring and growing our profitability.
2015 marks an important milestone for Mattel, as the company celebrates its 70th anniversary. In keeping with Mattel’s rich history of building cherished brands and memorable play experiences for children, we will continue to bolster our creative momentum and enhance brand relevance by partnering with some of the biggest brands in kids’ entertainment. In addition to outstanding partnerships with © Disney, Nickelodeon®, Warner Bros. Consumer Products and WWE® Wrestling, we recently added Star WarsTM to our ever-expanding entertainment portfolio, as well as new licenses like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles®.
And we are exploring innovative partnerships to bring new perspectives and dimensions to our products in 2015 and beyond. In fact, earlier this year we announced a novel collaboration with Google to reimagine the venerable View-Master®, giving the iconic toy a 21st-century twist.
I passionately believe in Mattel, our time-tested brands, our financial strength and our world-class talent. Thank you for your ongoing support, as we work to revitalize the company and its brands, deepen our connections with children and parents around the world, and deliver value to you, our shareholders.
 Sincerely,
      Christopher A. Sinclair Chairman and CEO Mattel, Inc.
