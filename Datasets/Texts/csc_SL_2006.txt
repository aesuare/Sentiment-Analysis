To Our Shareholders, Fiscal 2006 was a good year for CSC. We achieved record revenues from continuing operations of $14.6 billion, an increase of 4 percent over 2005. We also met or exceeded our financial goals in key areas such as earnings per share, return on investment and free cash f low.
We strengthened our position as a global IT services industry leader, and we are encouraged by our performance and optimistic about our prospects. During the year, we continued to place a strong emphasis on delivering net income growth through increased financial discipline and improved operational efficiencies and execution. CSC's fiscal 2006 earnings per share improved strongly over fiscal 2005's comparable results. Significantly, our balance sheet remains very solid, with $1.29 billion in cash and marketable securities as of March 31, 2006, primarily due to strong cash flow from operations. CSC's 9 percent return on investment from continuing operations was 81 basis points higher than last year and marks our best ROI performance since fiscal 2000. This represents good progress toward meeting our goal of double-digit returns. CSC will continue to control costs by leveraging our global scale and broad presence, achieving improvements in capital turnover, and undertaking a restructuring of resources. To strengthen our abilities to deliver business results to clients, our solutions increasingly incorporate industry, functional and process components drawn from across CSC and from a growing network of best-of-breed suppliers. CSC's capabilities to identify, evaluate and integrate components into total solutions; to manage a global supplier network; and to equip solutions to yield results -- in business terms -- are exactly what the market prizes. This was nowhere more evident last year than on the UK's National Health Service program, a remarkable and unprecedented undertaking by the UK government to improve healthcare services in England. The $1.7 billion, 10-year program showcases CSC's ability to pull together resources from across differing domains and from across the globe, and to work collaboratively with partners and subcontractors to meet difficult challenges. Our solid performance on this critical effort underscores CSC's position as a leader in managing strategically important, complex and difficult programs. CSC has long been known for solving difficult-butimportant problems in its work for the U.S. federal government, and CSC's performance in that marketplace was especially strong in fiscal 2006. CSC earned more than $5 billion in revenues from federal customers, an 8 percent increase over the previous year; revenues from U.S. Department of Defense customers grew by 16 percent. CSC is ranked among the top 10 defense contractors in the United States, and CSC is the service provider of choice for essential military programs in many areas,

including logistics, training and simulation and missile defense technology. CSC is also a recognized leader among U.S. federal civil agencies. One example is the central role CSC played in the successful March 1, 2006, opening of the NASA Shared Services Center at Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, the first of its kind. Created as a public/private partnership between NASA and CSC, the center brings together, in a single location, systems from 10 NASA facilities across the country. Today, the center provides a wide range of business and technology services to some 20,000 NASA employees. Our work for commercial clients is no less excellent or important. One example is our $236 million, five-year outsourcing agreement with Renault -- one of the largest such agreements in France. We are delivering business results to Renault by overhauling their IT to improve opera-

tional efficiency and reduce IT costs. Another example is Deutsche Bank, the eighth largest bank in the world, where we have jointly developed an advanced invoicing solution now being provided to customers as a softwareas-a-service offering. Our North American consulting operation continued to show signs of renewed strength, with top-line growth of 6 percent for the fiscal year. Growth in less capital-intensive areas of our business such as consulting and systems integration directly contributed to improvements in ROI. Even as our federal business flourishes, CSC's global commercial segment accounted for fully 65 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2006. CSC has deep expertise in a number of industries. For one, we expanded our already significant footprint in healthcare with a previously awarded 10-year, $1.4 billion outsourcing arrangement with Ascension Health, the

In fiscal 2006, we secured a number of significant new contract awards and key contract renewals and extensions. Major business announcements were $12.1 billion, the third highest in CSC's history. In addition to those already noted, new contracts awarded to CSC in fiscal 2006 included:

delivery models for its outsourcing customers. In each case, industry-leading practices were joined with state-of-theart technologies to provide customers with unprecedented opportunities to create and capture untapped business value through their relationship with CSC. In late 2005, CSC received the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, the nation's highest presidential honor for quality and organizational performance excellence, for its DynMcDermott Petroleum Operations unit. DynMcDermott is responsible for managing the nation's strategic petroleum reserve for the U.S. Department of Energy, and under extremely adverse conditions -- which included two hurricanes -- we succeeded in keeping the reserves flowing. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge outgoing Chief Financial Officer Lee Level for the very significant contributions he has made to CSC during his 17 years as CFO. In that time -- and thanks to Lee's leadership -- CSC experienced extraordinary change, geographic expansion, sector diversification and growth. Lee continues to bring his vast experience and deep knowledge to the company by serving as a corporate vice president. In February 2006, Lee oversaw the successful transition of CFO duties to Michael E. Keane, who joined CSC in 2005. Our continued success is made possible by the hard work and dedication of our global workforce of 79,000, and I would like to also acknowledge the contributions each employee has made to our continuing success. In April, CSC started implementing a restructuring program that is expected to significantly improve future cash flow and earnings. This program is designed to streamline CSC's worldwide operations and leverage the increased use of lower-cost resources. As important, it signals a deliberate

move by CSC away from lower-value and lower-margin types of work. These actions are necessary to help us achieve meaningful margin improvements and help us retain our global competitiveness, while providing our customers with increased value. The changes taking place in the IT services industry play to CSC's greatest strengths and we continue to focus on delivering business results that provide benefits to our clients. CSC regards change as opportunity, and we will continue to draw on our strengths and seize opportunities for the benefit of our clients, our employees and our shareholders. Whatever the change, whatever the condition, CSC is dedicated to driving value and delivering results. That is our business. It is the business of IT. Sincerely,

Van B.Honeycutt Chairman and Chief Executive Officer June 7, 2006
