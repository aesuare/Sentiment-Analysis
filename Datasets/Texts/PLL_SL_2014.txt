solid sales and operations execution. Beyond the results for the year, we made significant progress against all of our multi-year objectives. We also continued to invest in innovation that will translate to growth for the future. We generated reasonable top line growth given the industrial end market environment, strong incremental margins and solid free cash flow. We are very proud of our team for this accomplishment. Innovation has been reinvigorated at Pall with increasing new product development, patent applications and invention dis closures. $190

SG&A was down 140 basis points in fiscal 2014 and is down nearly 250 basis points since fiscal 2012. We're positioned to continue to generate solid year-over-year performance based on reasonable growth assumptions but coupled with our continued concentration on working more efficiently and leveraging our global footprint more effectively. Our capital deployment priorities have been very clear--internal investment for organic growth and M&A are the top priorities. Our deployment of cash has significantly increased over the past several years. In fact, fiscal 2014 represents the highest annual M&A spend in the past decade. In fiscal 2014 we continued to grow and enhance our portfolio though a series of strategic acqui sitions including Medistad, SoloHill®, ATMI Life Sciences and FSI®. We welcome all of our new team members to the Pall family. While we are pleased with what we have accomplished, we still have significant room to improve in meeting the high expectations of our customers and our shareholders. Given the progress in fiscal 2014, and a stronger team than ever before, we are very optimistic about 2015 and beyond.

Sincerely,

Lawrence D. Kingsley Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
