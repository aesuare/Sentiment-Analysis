Letter to Our Shareholders:While the economic situation resulted in certain financial challenges,I couldn’t wait to tell you about the year’s tremendous accomplishmentsin Pentair’s Annual Report for 2009.Thanks to the dedication and resolve of our 13,000-plus employees,Pentair emerged stronger from the global recession. As we glance overour shoulder at the recessionary road behind us, we reflect on a numberof critical achievements. We executed well against our cost actions.These were tough decisions, but necessary in order to control our owndestiny. We also rewarded our shareholders with a dividend increaseat a time when many companies were retrenching. And, our focus onPentair’s Integrated Management System (PIMS) allowed us to driveoperating excellence while maintaining investments in research, newproduct development, and key growth initiatives.By embracing the spirit of “improving every day” and leveraging ourcommitment to “winning right,” we are confident our accomplishmentswill endure. It is this character which has allowed us to face ourchallenges head-on and reinforces our confidence that the best forPentair is yet to come.A year ago we were realistic about the economic situation and resolved totake actions that would be proactive and swift. We did that. We remainrealistic and focused —and are optimistic about the growth opportunitiesopening up to us and confident in our ability to capture them.5500 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 800Minneapolis, MN 55416–1261763 545 1730 Tel16 Pentair Annual Report 2009Pentair Company ProfilePentair, Inc. employs approximately 13,000 people, with facilities in over 40 countries and is focused on twoattractive segments: water and technical products.As a global, diversified manufacturing company, Pentair serves the commercial, industrial, agricultural,municipal and residential markets through innovative solutions under strong brand names.* Pentair’s Watersegment — which includes global Engineered Flow, Filtration Solutions, Pool Equipment, ResidentialFiltration, and Residential Flow businesses — helps deliver safe, clean water to industries, businesses andindividuals.

Sales dropped to$2.7 billion, a decrease of 20 percent comparedto 2008, impacted heavily by the global recession.Earnings per share of $1.17 (GAAP-basis) representeda significant reduction versus 2008. Thesereported earnings include restructuring chargesassociated with closing 18 facilities over the pasttwo years. Adjusting for the non-recurring items,earnings per share of $1.47 (adjusted) were downabout 30 percent. Because of productivity savingsof approximately $250 million, we offset mostof the impact of the tremendous decline in volumesto deliver solid profitability.Despite lower earnings in 2009, we are encouragedby the results of our initiatives and we exited 2009with momentum. Fourth quarter 2009 earnings pershare grew when compared to 2008. This trajectorydemonstrates the powerful results from acceleratingthe consolidation of our global manufacturing andadministrative footprint. And, while fourth quartersales remained in decline year-over-year, the trendsimproved each quarter throughout 2009.Partner with PentairRandallJ. Hogan,Chairman& CEOThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 wassigned into law in February 2009 and is designed to pour billionsof dollars into the U.S. economy. Pentair acted swiftly to analyze thelegislation and develop a white paper to share with key internaland external stakeholders. The company also developed a web siteand sales initiative called “Partner With Pentair” which is designed totrack ARRA project monies and promote sales channel development.Pentair is proud to provide these proactive tools to its customers,channel partners, and employees.Visit www.partnerwithpentair.com for more information.improving every dayPartner with PentairEconomic StimulusPartnershipOpportunities2 Pentair Annual Report 2009Pentair’s Technical Products SegmentPentair’s Water Segment2009 SALESBY BUSINESS WITHIN WATER21% |17% |33% |13% |16% | engineeredflowfiltrationsolutionspoolresidentialfiltrationresidential flow2009 SALESBY REGION WITHIN WATER16% |19% |65% | USEMEAROW2009 SALESBY MARKET FOR TECH PRODUCTS9% |10% |33% |6% |2% |7% |26% |7% | commercialcommunicationsenergygeneral electronicsindustrialinfrastructuremedicalsecurity & defense2009 SALESBY REGION WITHIN TECH PRODUCTS15% |19% |66% | USEMEAROWPentair is a leading global provider of water technology and equipment for the commercial, industrial,agricultural, municipal and residential markets. The company makes filtration, purification, water treatment,pump and systems solutions and pool equipment and related technologies.· Engineered Flow · Filtration Solutions · Pool Equipment · Residential Filtration · Residential FlowPentair Technical Products is the leading provider of worldwide product and service solutions for enclosing,protecting and cooling electrical and electronic systems. Its industry-leading brands — Hoffman®, Schroff®,McLean® Cooling Technology, Calmark®, Birtcher®, Aspen Motion™ Technologies and Taunus™ — provide abroad variety of standard, modified and custom solutions to the commercial, communications, energy, generalelectronics, industrial, infrastructure, medical, and security and defense markets.Pentair has a long history of generating outstandingfree cash flow from operations. In 2009, ourbusinesses generated over $207 million in free cashflow — well in excess of 160 percent of net income.Included in this total was a $25 million discretionarypension contribution pre-payment to satisfy our2010 obligation. We reduced our debt levels byapproximately $150 million; strengthening analready healthy balance sheet. I am pleased to notethat in early 2010 we increased our dividend sixpercent to $0.76 per share for the year markingthe 34th consecutive annual increase.So, we delivered tremendous productivity savingsand outstanding free cash flow results but our fullyear sales and earnings were certainly not whatwe wanted.Through it all, we acted to ensure Pentair wouldbe well-positioned when markets recover. Bysuccessfully executing against these actions, we shiftour attention toward growth. And, as we shift ourattention, we believe the company is in a betterposition to drive growth:· We maintained our growth investments inglobal sales, marketing and product developmentto ensure longer term success.· We increased our capacity in Mexico, China, Indiaand Poland — where we expect strong growth.· We strengthened an already strong balance sheetand are ready for additional growth investments.· Our Global Business Units are beginning to seerecovery in many key markets. Each is poised forgrowth and productivity heading into 2010.· Through our PIMS initiatives, we continued toimprove product quality, on-time delivery andworkplace safety.· Finally, Pentair is more globally balanced asapproximately 35 percent of our sales were outsidethe United States, compared to roughly 25 percentin 2005. We continue to flow resources to our mostattractive markets.The past decade has been witnessto remarkable change at Pentair.Over the past ten years, we transformed our portfolioand recently transformed our cost structure.We maintained and built upon a strong culturecommitted to “improve every day” and “win right”in everything we do. Today, our company is morediverse, more global, and stronger financially.As we enter the new decade we turn our attentionto a new agenda — a growth agenda.We have a terrific foundation for growth. As aleader in both Water and Technical Products, ourbusinesses are well positioned to serve globalcustomers and solve critical needs. Every day wedeliver thousands of products to distributors,dealers, retailers and individual consumers theworld over. I am proud to point out Pentair productsat hotels and factories we visit, and restaurantswe patron. I am especially proud of our productshelping where the need is greatest — such as waterstarvedregions where access to clean, safe water isat a premium. Pentair does so many fantastic things.Building upon this foundation is critical, and wecan do it. We are building an even greater company— one which is delivering sustainable solutionsto our customers and sustainable results to ourshareholders, employees and communities.We provide sustainable solutions to customersaround the world that need our systems to ensuretheir water quality meets exact specifications.Our Technical Product’s business provides sustainablesolutions to thousands of customers whoPentair Annual Report 2009 3demand high performance from their equipmentand safety for their employees. Around the world,our employees are empowered to drive a sustainableculture by looking for ways to enhance the customerexperience while always performing with integrity.This commitment delivers sustainable financialresults and solid environmental and social records.We are proud to be a global leader in our diverseset of industries and this pride is what sustains usaround the world.At Pentair, one of our competitiveadvantages is the relentless pursuitof innovative solutions.By our investment in research, development andcommercial growth initiatives, we have excitingnew products, new systems and a stronger leadershipposition in our key markets. A great exampleof our burgeoning systems capabilities is the newDung Quat refinery in Vietnam. When excessivesilica in the water threatened to disrupt start-upproduction, our Asia team leveraged Pentair’sproduct breadth and systems capabilities to createan innovative solution. By integrating Pentair’spre-treatment tanks, valves and Aqualinepre-filtration along with Pentair reverse osmosispumps, vessels and controls, we enabled rapiddesign and implementation.We remain excited about infrastructure investmentin developing nations and also in the United States.Pentair is well-positioned as a leader in waterinfrastructure — with over 100 years of experiencein water and waste water solutions. One recenthighlight was the record order we booked in 2009.As the Army Corps of Engineers strengthens thecity of New Orleans’ flood water protection system,Pentair’s Engineered Flow business was selected toprovide proven technology and services to the largestpump station in the world at the Harvey StreetCanal.

Whenplanning began for the city of Sydney’s desalinationplant, contractor Blue Water JV (VeoliaWater and John Holland) chose Pentair for itsexpertise in desalination applications.Pentair installed 4,600 of its Codeline™vessels, a leader in membrane housingsbuilt to maximize the performance of waterpurification systems. For over three decades,Codeline has been the most trusted brandin critical and demanding applications fordesalination, reverse osmosis, nanofiltrationand ultrafiltration.As the largest Codeline installation to date,the Sydney plant provides 15 percent of thecity’s water needs, pumping approximately66 million gallons of water per day.Pentair’s Codeline facility, based in Goa, India,manufactures about 30,000–35,000 vesselsper year.Pentair Annual Report 2009 5Spotlight: New Orleans’ Harvey Street Canal Pump StationA Leader in Water InfrastructureStarting in 2010, Pentair will deliver a dozen pumps to New Orleans’ Harvey Street Canal Pump Station.Each pump will have a discharge diameter of approximately 15 feet and capable of pumping nearly700,000 gallons of water per minute. During a hurricane, the Pentair pumps will handle all flows exitingfrom 22 miles of levees and floodwalls and ten pump stations into Harvey and Algiers Canals.Pentair’s history, the $60 million award demonstratesour importance as a leader in infrastructure andmunicipal water systems. Equipment deliveries areset to begin in 2010 and will continue through 2011.While our technology helps protect New Orleansfrom too much water, Pentair solutions willhelp manage water in a very different way atTarget Field, the new home of the Minnesota Twinsmajor league baseball team. Beginning in 2010,Pentair is partnering with the Minnesota Twins tospotlight the global issue of water by setting a newstandard for water use in sports facilities.

Now that’s a home run!Pentair Technical Productscontinues to be a leader inpartnering with customers.By providing Pentair’s high performance enclosures,we protect employees, equipment and sensitivedata. For example, multinational retailer Best Buyturned to Pentair when they wanted to upgradetheir U.S. data center. Working closely with theBest Buy IT leadership and data teams, we provideda customized solution with our Data NetworkingCabinets, Racks, and Cable Tray products. ThePentair solution allowed Best Buy to exceed theirobjectives for both performance and protection,which led them to entrust us even further. Startingin 2010, Pentair will be protecting their electronicsglobally at Best Buy’s data centers in the Middle Eastand Asia Pacific.Throughout 2008 and 2009, we made tremendousprogress aligning our businesses to improve efficiency,enhance customer service, and drive higher technologysolutions — all to position our company tobetter satisfy our customers. By forming our globalbusiness units: Engineered Flow, Filtration Solutions,Pool Equipment, Residential Filtration, ResidentialFlow and Technical Products, we are organizedto drive sustainable growth while adding breadthand scale to satisfy global customer demands.Our talented, global work force has leveragedthis alignment to advance our recognition ofopportunities around the world, ensuring we areleveraging best practices to reduce redundancy andimprove the customer experience.Pentair Annual Report 2009 7Leading the WayOver a year ago, Pentair announcedits initiative to eliminate bottled waterin all of its locations worldwide.The company’s commitment is to provideits employees with premium, filtered water,and at the same time significantly decreasethe waste that bottled water creates.In 2009, Pentair accomplished its goal.The company is generating significantly lesswaste and saving money along the way —because bottled water can cost up to 2,000times the cost of filtered tap water.Perhaps no issue is more critical tothe world than the environment.Whether it is energy or water, our future dependson the efficient and thoughtful use of natural resources.Pentair’s solutions address these challenges. Insideour company we monitor and improve our ownenvironmental footprint it is part of how we“win right.” We are proud of our record as a globalcitizen and remain committed to being thoughtfulof our impact on the earth. Being good stewardsof the environment has been an element of Pentair’sCode of Conduct since the beginning. And, we constantlymonitor our citizenship practices and policiesaround the world in environment, governance, healthand safety and in employee and community relations.Each year we inspire thousands of people aroundthe world with our commitment to charitable efforts.These efforts are led by The Pentair Foundation.Established in 1998 to formalize the company’stradition of community support, the Foundationis funded through our commitment to dedicate twopercent of our annual pre-tax income to charitable efforts.The Foundation also is a mechanism for Pentairto act quickly when tragedy strikes. In early 2010,when the country of Haiti was struck with a devastatingearthquake, the need for clean, safe waterwas paramount. Within hours, Pentair was workingwith our charitable partner, Water Missions International(WMI) to provide 10 Living Water TreatmentSystems (LWTS) and five chlorinators. And, alongwith General Electric, our Residential Filtration JointVenture partner, we provided solar powered Homespringunits to areas with limited to no water supply.Combined, these systems provide potable drinkingwater to approximately 100,000 people daily.8 Pentair Annual Report 2009Spotlight:Project SafewaterLast year, Pentair highlighted a major humanitarianeffort — Pentair’s Project Safewater inColon, Honduras. Its partnership with thenon-profit Water Missions International reachedsignificant milestones in 2009: Approximately200,000 people now have access to cleandrinking water and about 18,000 people havegained access to clean sanitation facilities.In addition, scientific data on the effectivenessof the program has begun to be gathered,in cooperation with the U.S. Centers for DiseaseControl and the Honduran Department of Health.The goal is to provide all 400,000 residents ofthe Colon region with clean water, and Pentairis well on its way to achieving that.Colon,HondurasAt Pentair, and through the work of The PentairFoundation, we are proud to provide assistancewhen and where it is needed most. Furthermore,the Foundation will continue to promote education,environmental conservation, vocational readiness,self-sufficiency and general well-being.A few years ago we could not haveimagined the economic decline thatgripped our markets in 2009. At thesame time, the challenge it presentedbrought forth a tremendous effortand commitment to become strongeras a company.We executed against our commitments and,as a result, we are more energized and confident.Our people remain focused, realistic, and eagerto tackle our most critical customer needs.As we look ahead, the company acceleratestoward sustainable growth. We are determinedto win, and “win right.”Thank you for your support. I look forwardto reporting on our continued progress.Randall J.
