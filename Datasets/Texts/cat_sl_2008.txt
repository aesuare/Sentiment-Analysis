caTerpillar 2008 ANNUAL RepoRt
  letter from our chairman
2008 was a tale of two years. For the first nine months, the boom that began in 2004 rolled on. We were driven by solid
growth in the developing economies that was supported by good global demand from the mining and energy sectors
as commodity prices encouraged new equipment investment.

caTerpillar 2008 ANNUAL RepoRt
 Despite recessionary conditions in North America, Europe and Japan, Team Caterpillar continued to deliver record results during the first three quarters. We shipped tens of billions of dollars in equipment to customers, increased market share and introduced new products—including the next generation
of mining trucks, the industry’s first electric drive track-type tractor and the Cat C175 engine—
to help our customers operate more cleanly and efficiently. Internally, the Caterpillar Production System continued to gain momentum, as we met our aggressive year-end assessment target and improved safety, quality and inventory performance.
But toward the end of the fourth quarter, we realized a seismic shift in the global industries
we serve. The global credit market crisis weakened already shaky business conditions in the developed countries and, by the end of 2008, was beginning to have a significant negative effect on the developing world as well.
Commodity prices dropped dramatically—many declining by as much as 60 percent in the fourth quarter—and discouraged our mining and energy customers from opening new mines and expanding production. We realized wild swings in global currencies, which affected our manufacturing costs,
pricing strategies and overall profitability and competitiveness. Equity markets around the world lost significant value, and world financial markets remained under tremendous stress. Frankly, there hasn’t been a time during my 35 years at Caterpillar when so many factors that affect our business changed so quickly and dramatically.
Despite this precipitous downturn, Team Caterpillar delivered a record year in 2008.
Sales and revenues topped $51 billion, exceeding our 2010 goal of $50 billion two years ahead
of schedule. Profit per share was also a record
at $5.66.

research & Development
(dollars in millions)
Additionally, we continued to invest in our future. We invested in our people with over $60 million
in training and development. We invested to expand and modernize our facilities with $2.4 billion in capital expenditures. We invested in new product innovations with over $1.7 billion for research and development. And we restructured our organization to align more closely and effectively with our customers. At the same time, we delivered results to our shareholders—raising our dividend rate
17 percent and reaching a significant milestone with 75 consecutive years of quarterly dividend payments.
Looking ahead, projections for global growth are down dramatically everywhere, affecting practically every industry we serve. While 2009 is very difficult to forecast, we expect our sales and revenues to
be around $40 billion, plus or minus 10 percent, with profit per share of $2.00 ($2.50 excluding redundancy costs) at a $40 billion sales level.
We’ve always been mindful that we serve highly cyclical industries. To ensure we were prepared
for the next downturn, we established “trough” planning as one of the critical success factors when we introduced our enterprise strategy back in 2005. In late 2008 and early 2009, we began executing our trough plans in earnest including:
› Reducing our workforce by about 20,000 through a combination of voluntary and involuntary separations, layoffs and the elimination of most contract, agency and temporary workers
› Scheduling temporary plant shutdowns for most of our operations around the world and working shortened work weeks in certain regions
› Implementing flexible order cancellations so that dealers can reduce their inventories
› Reducing total compensation for management and support employees by up to 50 percent
› Reducing inventory levels in line with lower physical plant volumes
› Managing capital expenditures and discretionary expenses to balance short-term needs with long-term strategic initiatives
› Working closely with dealers and suppliers worldwide to stay aligned for lower capacity requirements, increased efficiency and overall cost management
In addition to the significant cost-reduction efforts we are implementing in the short term, we
are continuing to invest strategically for long-term growth, industry leadership and global competi- tiveness. And most important of all, we’re keeping a heightened focus on delivering the highest quality products and services to our customers.
I know these actions disrupted the lives of our employees and their families, and I regret
that we had to take these steps. But preserving the long-term viability of our company requires tough actions. This economic crisis is shaping up to
be the most serious since the Great Depression— and almost certainly will be the worst recession we’ve experienced since the early 1980s. All of Team Caterpillar must make sacrifices to ensure
the survival and future strength of our business. Even with these challenges, I am confident in
our prospects for the future. We’re financially sound with an investment-grade credit rating and
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  04 05 06 07 08     04 05 06 07 08

access to the capital we need to run our business. Our global manufacturing footprint is the broadest in our industry and its efficiency and cost
are rapidly transforming under the Caterpillar Production System powered by 6 Sigma.
We have a diverse lineup of products and services, reaching a broader customer base than ever before. The ongoing growth of our integrated services businesses, which represent 34 percent of the company’s total sales and revenues, helps provide earnings stability. Our global Cat dealer organization remains strong, well-funded and a competitive advantage unmatched in our industry.
This economic downturn will not stop the world’s need for better infrastructure and more energy. Caterpillar’s products and services are essential for restoring economic growth globally; and when
recovery comes, we will be ready to hit the ground running. That’s why we’re laser focused on executing our strategy, including capital invest- ments in our production facilities, expansion of our business in key markets, investments in
new product development and training to enable our people to deliver operational excellence.
I want to thank Team Caterpillar, our dealers and suppliers for their continued commitment as
we work through these unprecedented times. There are great challenges, but I have every confidence
in our team and our strategy. We can meet this remarkably difficult challenge and emerge from this recession a stronger, better company.
Good companies become great companies when they face and conquer adversity. This is our chance to be great. We’re not just positioned to survive
this financial downturn. We’re poised to strengthen our global leadership position. Working together, Team Caterpillar can build a company that is one of the best in the world!
