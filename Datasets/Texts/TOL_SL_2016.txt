DEAR SHAREHOLDER
As we approach our 50th anniversary, we remain true to our goal of providing each and every customer with the quality, value, and service that are the hallmarks of the Toll Brothers brand.
A UNIQUE BRAND SERVING THE SWEET SPOT IN THE LUXURY NEW HOME MARKET
As the only national home building company focused on the luxury market, Toll Brothers continues to benefit from healthy demand, limited competition in many regions, superior land positions, a financially strong buyer base, and a highly recognizable brand. These strategic advantages and a solid financial foundation have propelled us to more than triple our revenues and increase net income nine-fold in the past five years. Based on these initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to grow in a vibrant luxury new home market. One of our key drivers is our brand, which received unprecedented recognition in 2016. This year, Toll Brothers ranked #6 among all 1,500 companies in Fortune magazine's survey of the World's Most Admired Companies for the quality of our products and services. We were behind only Apple, Walt Disney, Amazon, Alphabet, and Nordstrom. While there has been some debate about softness in the luxury housing market, we continue to produce impressive results by serving what we believe is the demographic sweet spot in the luxury market. We are not focused on ultra-luxury. Rather, with an average delivered home price of approximately $850,000 company-wide in FY 2016-- and $690,000 in markets other than New York City and California--our product lines are affordable to many households in the United States. A new study by John Burns Real Estate Consulting supported what we are experiencing in our segment of the luxury market. This report noted that in the 12 months ending September 2016, sales of homes priced above $600,000 rose in 37 of the 43 counties in the 16 states studied, and that home sales above $600,000 in the same period exceeded sales in the prior 12 months by 10%. In addition, according to a recent study by the Urban Land Institute, "From 2000­2015, suburban areas accounted for 91% of the population growth and 84% of the household growth in the top 50 metros." These positive data points are significant, given our price points and the fact that 90% of our business is transacted in the suburbs.

OUR BRAND, LAND HOLDINGS, AND DIVERSE PRODUCTS HELP DRIVE STRONG PERFORMANCE
The value of our brand, our demographically targeted product lines, and our well-located communities all helped drive this year's results. In FY 2016, revenues of $5.17 billion and home building deliveries of 6,098 units rose 24% in dollars and 10% in units, compared to FY 2015. Our net signed contracts of $5.65 billion and 6,719 units increased 14% in dollars and units, compared to FY 2015. In FY 2016, our net income of $382.1 million, $2.18 per share, grew 5.2% and 10.7% respectively, and our pre-tax income of $589.0 million grew 10.0%, compared to FY 2015. Gross margin, as a percentage of revenues, was 19.8% in FY 2016, compared to 21.6% in FY 2015. Impacting FY 2016's gross margin and pre-tax income, reported in cost of sales, were $13.8 million of inventory impairments and $125.6 million of warranty charges, primarily related to older stucco homes. FY 2015's pre-tax income and gross margin included $35.7 million of inventory impairments and a comparable $14.7 million warranty charge. Gross margin, excluding interest, inventory write-downs, and the above warranty charges, as a percentage of revenues, was 25.6% in FY 2016, compared to 26.3% in FY 2015. FY 2016 pre-tax income, excluding inventory write-downs and the above warranty charges, was $728.4 million, compared to $586.0 million in FY 2015, an increase of 24.3%. FY 2016's fourth quarter was our ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in contract dollars and units. Our fourth-quarter net signed contracts of $1.47 billion and 1,728 units rose 17% in dollars and 20% in units, compared to FY 2015's fourth quarter. On a per-community basis, FY 2016's fourth-quarter net signed contracts rose 12% to 5.82 units.

We believe there is still significant unmet demand for new homes in the United States.
We enter FY 2017 with positive momentum. We begin the new fiscal year with FYE 2016's backlog of $3.98 billion and 4,685 homes, up 14% in dollars and 15% in units, compared to FYE 2015. As the Wall Street Journal recently reported, even with the unemployment rate at the lowest level in a decade and eight years of economic expansion, new home construction remains well below historic production norms. Therefore, we believe that the market is likely to continue on its path of steady recovery. Based on our FY 2016 results and the current state of the economy, we believe FY 2017 will be another year of solid growth in revenues and profit. We project FY 2017 home building revenues of between $5.0 billion and $6.2 billion. This is based on delivering between 6,500 and 7,500 homes in FY 2017 at an average price between $775,000 and $825,000 per home. We grew our community count by 7.6% during FY 2016 to end the year with 310 selling communities. We expect similar community count growth in FY 2017.

OUR STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SUPPORT OUR GROWTH
We ended FY 2016 with $633.7 million of cash and $961.8 million available under our $1.295 billion bank revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital and net debt-to-capital ratios were 47.2% and 40.9%, respectively, and stockholders' equity was $4.23 billion at FYE 2016. In May 2016, we expanded our bank revolving credit facility to $1.295 billion and 20 banks, and extended the term to May 2021. Similarly, in August 2016, we extended our $500 million floating rate bank term loan to August 2021. We now have nearly $1.8 billion of long-term credit facilities with 21 banks at an average interest cost below LIBOR +150. In October 2016, we also increased and expanded the mortgage warehouse facility of TBI Mortgage Company, our wholly owned home financing subsidiary, to $210 million. Based on what we believe is an undervalued stock price, and with our focus on improving shareholder value and return on equity, we continue to pursue strategies to improve our capital efficiency. During FY 2016, we repurchased an additional $392.8 million (13.7 million shares) of stock and an additional $15.0 million (550,000 shares) at the start of FY 2017. Other measures to improve our return on equity include forming capital- and riskefficient joint ventures and, potentially, modestly increasing our leverage, and utilizing additional lower-cost variable rate borrowings. Since the start of FY 2016, we have completed nearly $1 billion of joint venture debt and equity transactions. These involve three types of properties: our larger, more capitalintensive New York City high-rise condominium projects; all of our urban and suburban rental projects; and a number of our larger master planned communities. These financings, which encompass both project-specific construction and permanent loans, and projectspecific third-party equity investments, enable us to reduce our equity exposure, generate fees, earn promotes based on performance success, and increase our return on investment. We will continue to use joint venture structures as a strategy to improve return on equity. In April 2016, our wholly owned Gibraltar Capital and Asset Management subsidiary, a fullservice real estate investment, capital origination, and asset management platform, formed a joint venture with a large institutional investor. This joint venture will provide builders and developers with land banking, debt, and equity capital for the acquisition and development of land and home sites, and other complementary opportunistic investment strategies. The venture, which is managed by Gibraltar, has a total of $400 million of funding commitments: 75% from third-party capital and 25% from Toll Brothers. The joint venture has closed transactions totaling $76 million of funding commitments to date.

BROADENING OUR FOOTPRINT AND PRODUCT LINES AS WE PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE
We continue to pursue growth initiatives to amplify the value of the Toll Brothers brand. Through our dual-pronged strategy of expanding and diversifying our geographic footprint and broadening our platform of residential product lines, we are reaching affluent buyers across the demographic spectrum: from higher-income millennials to baby boomers and many more in between. California, where we build primarily in the coastal suburbs of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, remained our largest housing market. With a multiyear land position in desirable coastal locations, we see this as a dynamic region for us for years to come. We also enjoyed strong demand in our other western markets of suburban Seattle, Phoenix, Reno, Las Vegas, and Denver. These markets in total accounted for 45% in dollars and 36% in units of signed contracts in FY 2016. With the goal of augmenting our footprint in the west, in November 2016, we expanded into the Boise, Idaho market with the acquisition of Coleman Homes. In addition to the strength out west, we see solid demand in Dallas, Jacksonville, Orlando, Northern Virginia, Philadelphia, and New Jersey. As household formations increase across the United States, our core product remains move-up communities. We serve growing families with a diverse selection of residences ranging from close-knit communities of 25 homes to master planned communities of several thousand homes across multiple product lines. The maturing baby boomers entering their pre-retirement and retirement years are another demographic market in which we are expanding our presence. This segment, which we entered in the late 1990s, has continued to grow in importance as more baby boomers have entered their fifties and sixties. To meet this growing segment, our primary product is our active-adult, age-qualified communities with one buyer at least 55 years of age. These communities are often highly amenitized, with smaller, luxurious single-story homes. Originally concentrated in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest, our active-adult communities have recently been introduced in the West with communities now outside

In addition, we are reaching maturing baby boomers with a variety of other offerings including suburban single-story homes in high-amenity master planned communities; urban condominium communities in places such as New York City, Philadelphia, and metro Washington, DC; and urban and suburban Apartment Living communities, where a rented second home affords greater flexibility.

We are starting to benefit from the millennial generation's desire for homeownership. In FY 2016, approximately 22% of our settlements included one primary buyer 35 years of age or under.
With the millennial generation now entering their thirties and forming families, we are starting to benefit from the desire for homeownership from the leading edge of this huge demographic wave. In FY 2016, approximately 22% of our settlements included one primary buyer 35 years of age or under. We are courting these customers with our core move-up homes, attached suburban products, urban condominiums, and urban and suburban rental apartment properties. We are also introducing a new product line, T | Select by Toll Brothers, which incorporates the elegance and style of higher-end Toll Brothers homes but with fewer structural options, a quicker delivery time, and a slightly lower price. Toll Brothers Apartment Living, our rental property division, took major steps forward this year. We achieved stabilization on over 1,100 units in three projects: The Morgan at Provost Square, a 417-unit, 38-story tower by the Grove Street PATH train station in Jersey City, New Jersey; Parc Riverside, a 287-unit high-rise by the Nationals Park baseball stadium in Washington, DC; and Parc at Plymouth Meeting, a 398-unit suburban community northwest of Philadelphia. We are currently leasing up Parc Westborough, a 249-unit community west of Boston in Westborough, Massachussetts, and Riverworks, a 349-unit community west of Philadelphia in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. We are under construction on another 1,315 units in three projects: Union Place, a 525-unit high-rise adjacent to Union Station in Washington, DC; Kensington Place, a 400-unit community in East Brunswick, New Jersey; and The 2nd Avenue Residences, a 390-unit community in Needham, Massachussetts, just outside Boston. Through Toll Brothers Campus Living, we also completed and leased-up our first student housing community, Terrapin Row, an upscale 1,493-bed, 418-unit student living complex just steps from the southern tip of the University of Maryland campus in College Park. We now have a portfolio of urban and suburban rental projects stabilized, in lease-up, under construction, or in planning, totaling approximately 10,000 units, all of which are or will be undertaken in joint ventures. We believe we are creating significant shareholder value for the Company through Toll Brothers Apartment Living. Our urban for-sale condominium communities, developed by Toll Brothers City Living, continue to produce company-leading profit margins. City Living was formed in 2003, and has completed 30 buildings totaling approximately 3,900 units. We are currently offering condominiums in ten buildings, recently completed or under construction, totaling 1,024 units, of which 370 are left to sell. We have five additional buildings totaling 708 units in planning and development. We have become more cautious in our urban land buying, particularly in New York City, where we have seen a leveling of demand. We believe that we still have strong margins embedded in well-bought land acquired several years ago. Current and future projects, several of which are in joint ventures, are located in some of the most appealing residential neighborhoods in the New York City market, including Brooklyn Heights, Chelsea, Gramercy, NoMad, SoHo West, Sutton Place, Tribeca, Upper East Side, West Village, Hoboken, and Jersey City.

OUR 30TH ANNIVERSARY ON THE NYSE
In July 2016, we marked our 30th anniversary as a public company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), an impressive milestone in our three-decade evolution from a local suburban Philadelphia builder to a nationally diversified home building corporation with a uniquely recognized brand. At the time we went public in July 1986, we operated in three local markets: the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Wilmington, Delaware, and the central New Jersey communities in and around Princeton. In FY 1986, our first year on the NYSE, we produced revenues of $124.6 million from 15 communities. Our average home price was $155,000 and we ended FY 1986 with stockholders' equity of $31.4 million. Soon thereafter, we began expanding to adjacent markets. By 1989, when the housing market swooned, we were building our brand along the suburban Boston to Baltimore corridor. We battled through our first downturn as a public company and emerged with a strong balance sheet and a hoard of cash that enabled us to buy distressed properties and expand into the metro Washington, DC, market, and the New York City suburbs of Westchester County, New York, and southern Connecticut. From there, we entered California and continued to grow organically and through strategic company acquisitions to our current nationwide footprint, which spans 20 states and approximately 50 markets. Over the years, as we have expanded geographically and diversified our product lines, we have balanced our drive for growth with a strong and prudently structured financial foundation. During these three decades, as our reputation has grown, we have remained true to our goal of providing each and every customer with the quality, value, and service that are the hallmarks of the Toll Brothers brand. Whether the setting is our high-rise towers overlooking the Manhattan skyline, a home on a championship golf course, a large master planned community with a wide array of product lines, or a cozy neighborhood of young families, we seek to provide our buyers with the finest residential experience in the United States.

We thank our associates for their commitment to building what we believe is the finest brand in our industry.

We thank our shareholders for their continued support, our suppliers and contractors for their cooperative spirit, our capital providers for their confidence in our future, and our homeowners for putting their trust in us.
