As reported

On an operating basis

To Our Shareholders: Eaton's integrated diversification strategy is working, helping us to deliver record revenues and earnings for the seventh year in a row. We are tremendously proud of that accomplishment, especially given the challenges of a business environment in which financial and economic volatility have become household words. We entered 2007 facing a stiff headwind, as North American heavy-duty truck markets were projected to decline by more than 40 percent due to the changes in the U.S. diesel emissions standards. That management challenge became even tougher as the year went on as generally upbeat economic forecasts fell under the dark cloud of a credit crisis in global markets. Despite these hurdles, Eaton continued to deliver outstanding performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our business model throughout all phases of the economic cycle. As the world continues to change, the implications are clear: Businesses must become more nimble and have a broad base of diversification. At Eaton, that's exactly the kind of company we've become. Our Results Speak For Themselves We continued to significantly outgrow our end markets in 2007, setting new all-time records in both revenues and profitability. For the first time in Eaton's modern history, Eaton's profits increased in a year in which the North American heavy-duty truck business declined. During the year, North American heavy-duty truck markets declined by a whopping 44 percent while our fully diluted EPS grew by 6 percent. Among the year's financial and operating highlights:

Our sales surpassed $13 billion for the first time in our history, growing by 7 percent. For the seventh consecutive year, our revenue growth outpaced the growth in our end markets--by $235 million in 2007. We completed or announced 11 acquisitions during the year-- primarily in our Electrical and Fluid Power businesses. We increased operating earnings per share by 8 percent to a record $6.90. We generated $1.16 billion in cash from operations. We increased our dividend by 10 percent, and then again increased our dividend by 16 percent early in 2008.
· ·

·

We repurchased $340 million of our stock. We delivered a 22 percent return on shareholders' equity, again placing our return near the top of diversified industrial companies. And our all-in shareholder return was 31.5 percent!

The above graph compares the cumulative total shareholder return for the five years ending December 31, 2007 for Eaton Common Shares, the S&P 1500 Industrial Machinery Index, and the S&P 500 Index. These figures assume all dividends are reinvested when received, and are based on $100 invested in Eaton Common Shares on December 31, 2002.

This performance is not the result of a one-time event or a simple turn of good fortune. It is the product of a long-term strategy-- and the hard work and dedication of a team of employees who live and breathe that strategy every day.

Eaton is a company that never stands still.
We are constantly evolving to meet our customers' needs --

and today's market realities.
Diversification Is Paying Off Since this decade began, Eaton has been on a mission to achieve diversification across three key dimensions: business balance, geographic balance and balance through the three phases of the economic cycle. That difficult groundwork paid off handsomely in 2007 as we continued to move closer to our targets: Business Balance As a result of our organic growth initiatives and success with targeted acquisitions, approximately 70 percent of our revenues are now concentrated in the higher-growth electrical and fluid power industries. Our announced acquisitions of The Moeller Group and Phoenixtec, which are expected to close in early 2008, will move this balance ever closer to 75 percent of total revenues in 2008. We're Focusing on High-Growth Markets provide the disciplined set of processes and tools that ensure organization-wide alignment and compliance, rapid recognition and transfer of best practices, the framework for successful and rapid integration of acquisitions, and the framework and resources to help our employees focus upon continuing learning and career development. In a global environment of higher energy costs, rising emissions standards and the search for alternative energy sources, Eaton remains focused upon power management--the efficient, safe and sustainable applications of electrical, fluid and mechanical power. From a technology point of view, Eaton is increasingly well-positioned in the sweet spot of activity with our customers. Building on Strengths We made exciting progress in enriching our technological strengths and extending our geographic reach during 2007. The continued environment of high energy prices, the increased focus upon sustainable business strategies and the pace of global growth make our progress in each of these dimensions all the more important for our customers. Our Electrical Group has emerged as Eaton's largest business, notching a successful year in many dimensions. We completed or announced eight acquisitions:
· ·

Babco to expand our capabilities serving the fast-growth oil sands industry in Canada. The Moeller Group to expand our International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) product offerings and European distribution channels. Phoenixtec Power Company Ltd. to strengthen our global UPS business and significantly strengthen our channels in Taiwan, China and Eastern Europe.

·

·

Together, the small-business-systems business of MGE, The Moeller Group and Phoenixtec Power Company represents a major addition to the strategic capabilities of our Electrical Group. At the same time, our electrical team continued to capitalize upon the strong non-residential construction markets in North America, successfully introducing our FlashGardTM technologies into motor control centers and switchgear. The strong demand for more power-efficient technologies made receptive markets for our industry-leading energy-efficient new line of UPS equipment. And our vacuum interrupter-based medium voltage technologies hit the mark as the green alternative to more traditional arc interruption technologies employed by many of our competitors. In Fluid Power, our aerospace business continues to grow briskly, driven by many introductions of new commercial, business, general and military aircraft. Eaton is now a major supplier of hydraulics, pneumatic and fuel systems on commercial and military aircraft. Our fuel systems capabilities were enriched by the addition of Argo-Tech, which we acquired early in 2007. Eaton's development and commercialization of hydraulic hybrid technologies continues to win important new contracts with our customers. The addition of Arrow Hose and Tubing has broadened our fluid conveyance capabilities and access to rapidly growing food and beverage end markets. Increasing emissions, fuel economy and safety regulations provide important marketplace demand for our truck and automotive businesses. Eaton's industry-leading diesel-electric powertrains for commercial vehicles are now in use in Asia, North America and Europe. Our innovative new-generation superchargers are redefining the rules in air boosting for both gasoline and diesel engines. And our acquisition of the fuel components division of Saturn Electronics & Engineering, Inc. broadens our fuel vapor emissions-control capabilities. Raising the Stakes Volatility opens new opportunities but at the same time can cause hesitation--the understandable hesitation that emerges from a lack of certainty in the environment around us. While we appreciate the increased risk that accompanies volatility, we remain confident of the fundamental capabilities of our enterprise and our strategy for success.

Convinced of our plan--and confident in our people--we concluded that December 2007 was the right time for Eaton to take the next significant step in our evolution. That step was the bold simultaneous announcement to commit $2.5 billion to acquire The Moeller Group and Phoenixtec Power Company. These two acquisitions fundamentally reposition our electrical business as a leader in both global distribution and control and power quality, with a significantly enhanced product portfolio and geographic reach. The addition of approximately $1.9 billion of incremental revenues in 2008 and some 14,000 new employees also dramatically changes the size of our enterprise.

Geographic Balance In 2007, for the first time, approximately 50 percent of Eaton's revenues were driven by economies outside the United States. Never before has this global balance been more important. During 2008, when the U.S. economy is expected to underperform international economies, our acquisitions of The Moeller Group and Phoenixtec will further expand our base of international revenues to approximately 55 percent. Balance Through the Economic Cycle We have balanced our business portfolio to ensure that we have large globally capable businesses that afford Eaton the opportunity for consistent performance throughout the economic cycle. In 2007, we achieved balance in our portfolio with approximately one-third of our businesses being early-cycle, one-third mid-cycle and onethird late-cycle businesses. Integrated Power Diversification is not enough to build an enterprise capable of sustainable earnings growth on its own. And that is where the Eaton Business System provides unique value in our overall strategy. Now in its eighth year of implementation, EBS continues to

drive business to expand our power distribution and control assemblies portfolio.

Maintaining our Values Eaton's rapid and steady growth brings with it exciting new challenges and opportunities for our customers, our employees, our suppliers and the communities in which we do business.
