L. Phillip Humann
Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer
With its weak economy and unsettled business climate, 2002 was in many ways a year we are happy to have behind us. I For banks in general, the year was marked by slower revenue growth, higher credit quality costs and weaker performance than we have
problems at a handful of well-known insti- tutions seemed at times to cast a shadow over the rest of the industry. I SunTrust’s results, inevitably, reflected industry-wide pressures. Even so, we ended 2002 looking relatively good in most key measures of financial performance, strength and stability – especially when compared with other large U.S. banks.

            In this report, SunTrust presents a return on average assets less net unrealized gains on securities and a return on average realized equity. These performance measures exclude the net unrealized gains on the Company’s securities portfolio. Due to its ownership of 48 million shares of common stock of The Coca-Cola Company, the Company believes this is a more indicative performance measure when being compared to other companies.

 2 SunTrust
2002 Annual Report

 2002 brought tangible evidence of SunTrust’s capacity
to deliver demonstrably better results in a more accommodating environment.
    For us, however, “relatively good” is not good enough. It is satisfying, there- fore, that 2002 also brought with it tangible evidence of SunTrust’s capacity to deliver demonstrably better results in a more accommodating economic and market environment.
For the year, SunTrust reported net income of $1.33 billion. This compared with $1.38 billion in 2001. On a per share basis, net income in 2002 was $4.66, compared with $4.72 in the prior year. It is important to note that the year’s reported earnings were reduced by $39.8 million, or $.14 per share, in after-tax merger charges connected with our acquisition of the Florida franchise of Huntington Bancshares, Inc. That transaction was announced in 2001 and the merger integration completed, smoothly, in early 2002.

        earnings momentum
SunTrust’s record of growth in earnings is one of the best among large U.S. banks. Our earnings momentum, notably in recent years, reflects solid growth in our basic business coupled with strategic acquisitions.

Given the harshness of the environment, SunTrust’s performance last year was respectable. That said, shareholders should know our 2002 results don’t suggest the kind of growth we consider either satisfactory or indicative of our Company’s true earnings potential.
Shareholders and others desiring a detailed discussion of the year’s financial performance are encouraged to review the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section of this report. In this letter I will talk in more general terms about our results. Perhaps more important, I will also tell you why I think it’s reasonable for shareholders to feel optimistic about our prospects for 2003 and beyond.

bottom line consistency
SunTrust’s emphasis on consistency in “bottom line” results is reflected in earnings per share (EPS) growth over an extended period.

I Operating Earnings Momentum
2002 pressures notwithstanding, SunTrust can point to a multi-year record of generally consistent growth in operating earnings. Not many other large U.S. banks can say the same. We think shareholders deserve consistency in core performance, not surprises, and we strive to deliver it despite industry pressures and ups and downs of the economy.
There has, properly, been much recent discussion in the business community about the validity of operating earnings versus earnings reported according to generally accepted accounting principles (called “GAAP earnings”). We fully embrace the view that GAAP earnings are the earnings that matter. But we also consider it appropriate to present operating earnings – which exclude merger- related charges – as an additional indicator of SunTrust’s basic business performance over time.
SunTrust’s operating earnings differed from our GAAP earnings in just five recent instances. Each time, the only one-time charges excluded were costs incurred directly and specifically in connection with merger activity that took place outside our day-to-day business. We are proud that we have not taken either so-called “restructuring” or credit-related one-time charges. Although these charges were not uncommon in our industry in 2002, we believe them to be ultimately incompatible with the interests of our shareholders.

I Stock Trends: In Line with the Industry
Mirroring the poor performance of the stock market as a whole, the perform- ance of SunTrust stock in 2002 was not, to say the least, what we would have liked it to be.
As has been the case since mid-1998, the market tended to lump all banks together and our shares traded more or less in line with our peer group. The problem is that the performance of the group was lackluster.
2002’s experience confirmed the wisdom of not trying to predict future market movements. We remain convinced, however, that over time the price of SunTrust shares will improve in line with our improving performance. We also realistically hope to outperform our peers as we have in the past. We are doing the right things to make that happen.
Meanwhile, the Board of Directors in February 2003 approved a 5% increase in the dividend on SunTrust common stock, bringing our annual dividend to $1.80 per share. Our dividend history is another reflection of the premium we place on consistency.
I Maintaining Strong Credit Quality
With economic growth elusive, credit quality emerged as the number one concern for banks in 2002. The issue was framed by highly visible bankruptcies of some major corporations that, in turn, sparked announcements of related credit losses at several large U.S. banks. In addition, bank loans to certain large borrowers came under increased regulatory scrutiny under “shared national credit” (SNC) examinations by the Federal Reserve.

strong credit quality
SunTrust continued to outperform the largest U.S. banks in two key indicators of credit quality: nonperforming assets (NPAs) as a percentage of loans and foreclosed properties, and net charge-offs as a percentage of loans.
NPAs to Loans + Foreclosed Properties at December 31, 2002 2002 Net Charge-Off Ratio
SunTrust fared well in its SNC examinations, and our exposure to the more notorious bankruptcies of the year was manageable. Yet we still experienced our share of the industry’s credit challenges, especially in our portfolio of loans to large corporate borrowers. Nonperforming assets were down from the prior year but still higher than in normal times. Charge-offs were up from a year ago as we moved aggressively to recognize problems and get them behind us – without taking any special charge to earnings.
Historically, SunTrust has done better than most during times of credit weakness. That continued to be the case in 2002.

To put things in perspective, our level of nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed properties remained one of the lowest among major banks. Charge-offs, while high for us, still compared very well with the competition. And based on our current risk assessment as well as our historic loss experience, we are appropriately reserved.
I CounteringtheImpactofaWeakEconomy
A series of bright spots in our 2002 earnings picture helped soften the financial impact of the sluggish economy. For example, several loan categories – including home equity, small business and automobile lending – showed strong growth. With record levels of refinance activity, our Mortgage business had a blockbuster year. And customer deposits continued to grow at a strong pace, reflecting our growing sales effectiveness as well as market trends.

deposit generation
SunTrust places a high priority on attracting deposits, a very attractive source of funds to support loan growth. In recent years, deposit growth was particularly strong, reflecting growing sales effectiveness as well as market trends.
$79.7

But as is typical in periods of prolonged economic weakness, many business cus- tomers cut back on their bank borrowing. So for us, as for most other banks, total loan growth was weak. Further, we took deliberate action to position our balance sheet for the higher rate environment that comes with a strong economic recovery. As a strong recovery failed to materialize, unusually low interest rates put a squeeze on our net interest margin. As a result of all this, net interest income, our largest revenue component, was essentially flat for the year.
Noninterest income was also hurt by the economy. For example, trust and invest- ment fees, a major driver of noninterest income, were up 4% last year. Even though 4% doesn’t look so bad given a 23% drop in the S&P 500 Index, it is not the kind of growth we generally expect – or get – from this key business line.
The impact of weaker market-driven fees was offset to some degree by some positive trends. For example, we added a record number of new clients in our trust, investment and brokerage businesses. We enjoyed strong sales results of fee-based products in both our Retail and Commercial business lines. 2002 was also another year of excellent performance by our debt capital markets area, where results were up substantially over the prior year.

   I EnhancingRevenuePotential
The pervasive financial impact of the weak economy is masking what we think is SunTrust’s underlying earnings potential. Through a deliberate program of investment, selective acquisitions and concentrated management attention, we have worked to enhance the Company’s revenue generation capacity. In 2002, for example:
• Wereconfiguredourgeographicbankingorganizationtointensifylocalmarket focus, to streamline behind-the-scenes management processes and to make it easier to implement product innovations.
• Thecompletionofour“OneBank”initiative–thelargestsystemsconsolidation effort in SunTrust’s history – enhances consistency in customer service, improves efficiency and prepares us operationally to handle significant new growth.

• Creationofaseniorsalesexecutiveposition,impressivesalesresultsina cross-section of businesses and the installation of higher sales, service and retention standards for 2003 underscore our determination to deepen existing customer relationships as well as add new ones.

• ThevolumeofnewaccountsopenedthroughourSunTrustOnlinetelephone banking service and also via our redesigned website – www.suntrust.com – was again up substantially from prior year levels, illustrating the payoff from our investment in technology-based delivery channels.
Finally, recognizing that successful implementation of business initiatives ultimately depends on the quality of our workforce, we stepped up programs aimed at attracting and retaining top people. For example, our corporate diversity program was expanded with more than 2,500 managers participating in formal diversity training. Our in-house training arm, SunTrust University, offers nearly 1,400 training and developmental courses, including an expanded library of online training tools.
I SunTrust’s Conservative Operating Approach
SunTrust’s ability to emerge relatively unscathed from the turbulence of 2002 is in part attributable to a traditionally conservative approach to our business that has sometimes seemed out of step with our industry. We have, frankly, been skeptical at times when positive market recognition accrued to financial services institutions where rapid expansion was apparently not matched by a full under- standing of the risks involved. But in 2002, amidst heightened public, media and government scrutiny, SunTrust’s brand of conservatism seemed to be more valued.
conservative loan portfolio
SunTrust’s traditionally conservative approach to our business is reflected in the composition of our loan portfolio. We emphasize lower risk loan categories, such as residential mortgages and loans to smaller and mid-sized businesses, and a high degree of diversification. Equally important, SunTrust has avoided higher risk loan categories such as consumer credit card, Latin America and sub-prime lending.

The 6.7% projected population growth rate for SunTrust’s “footprint” is not only the highest among large U.S. banks, but significantly higher than the national average. We capitalize on the growth opportunities our markets present by offering highly competitive products and services to a broadly defined client base.

   Our conservative approach is reflected in different aspects of our operation: in our measured growth over time... our fundamentally risk-averse balance sheet... our disciplined approach to mergers and acquisitions... and in our resistance to esoteric financial or accounting strategies. SunTrust, for example, has made very limited use of off-balance sheet financing vehicles.
I Merits of Positive Differentiation
SunTrust benefited in 2002 from distinctive strengths that historically have differentiated us from the competition. They also figure prominently in our growth strategies.
Perhaps most visible is our strong Southeast/Mid-Atlantic geographic franchise. With almost 1,200 well-placed branches, we enjoy leading positions in some of the most attractive, high-growth banking markets in the United States.
We work to capitalize on the organic growth opportunities our markets present by offering highly competitive products and services to a broadly defined client base. In addition, our operating model emphasizes the role of local management – and local decision making – in product and service delivery.
For most individual customers, the “face” of SunTrust is not our Atlanta head- quarters. Rather, it is one of our 50-plus local banks, each headed by a local executive empowered to bring the full range of SunTrust capabilities to bear on client needs. Or perhaps it is our mortgage subsidiary, which in 2002 ranked as a national leader in customer satisfaction.

focus on efficiency
One indication of our focus on efficiency is a steady drop in our “core” staff level. This reduction was accomplished primarily through attrition.
SunTrust takes seriously its commitment to all segments of the communities in which we operate. In addition to our product offerings, that commitment is reflected in a wide range of activities ranging from corporate contributions to specialized loan programs to employee volunteerism and leadership in civic affairs.
Behind-the-scenes support is provided by a highly rated technology and information infrastructure. Its increasing effectiveness reflects significant capital investment in recent years.
I BalancingRevenueandEfficiency
As economic clouds clear, we expect to see the positive impact of earnings enhancement moves to become much more pronounced. But we are not counting on, nor waiting for, an improved economy alone to lift our performance.
As 2003 began, a series of targeted profit acceleration initiatives was getting underway in each of our key business lines. They are designed to spur revenue growth even if a strong economic recovery is slow in coming. At the same time, recognizing that we can’t control the economy, we continue to focus with intensity on something we can control – expenses.
In 2002, as it became clear that economy-related earnings pressures were not easing, expense control moved to center stage as a corporate priority. We instituted measures ranging from a company-wide hiring holiday at mid-year to tough decisions later to freeze executive salaries, forego management bonuses and eliminate an employee profit-sharing-type program.
Over the past few years, SunTrust has been doing a better job at keeping operating expense growth in line. One indication of our success is a steady drop in our “core” staff level; that is, our employee base not counting people added as a result of acquisitions. Importantly, this reduction was accomplished primarily through attrition and a disciplined approach to new hiring. In a year when announcements of broad-scale employee layoffs were almost commonplace in the financial services industry, SunTrust chose not to take such an action.
It is unavoidable that our people feel the pinch of corporate belt-tightening moves. But our approach to expense control reflects a long-standing belief that expense targets must be achieved without irreparably damaging the employee morale essential for providing quality customer service.
I CorporateGovernance
In the wake of inexcusable misdeeds by some major U.S. corporations, issues of corporate governance became, understandably, the subject of intense public policy focus in 2002.

SunTrust 2002 Annual Report
11

In line with national trends, we announced in mid-2002 that we were instituting a number of investor-oriented measures. Included was the creation of a new Compensation and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors. It is composed entirely of independent directors. We declared our intent to expense the cost of stock options awarded to employees each year. And we noted that, in accordance with newly crafted government requirements, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer had formally attested to the accuracy of the Company’s financial statements.
At SunTrust the high value we place on corporate integrity overall surely covers areas like financial management and financial reporting. Moves by national policy makers to raise the standards in these areas for all publicly held companies are, in our view, very much to the good.
I AClosingPerspective
Before inviting your attention to the financial section of this report, let me observe that while 2002 was in some ways a year we are happy to have behind us, it was not without its positive dimensions. Perhaps most satisfying, it underscored the capacity of our organization not only to withstand the impact of a weak economy, but to maintain a steady, forward momentum despite it.
2002 also brought out the best in our people, many of whom were confronted with a problematic industry environment for the first time in their careers. My thanks go to all our employees for their extra effort in 2002.
I also thank our Board of Directors – to which we were pleased to welcome Karen Hastie Williams, partner in the Washington, D.C. law firm of Crowell & Moring – for its perspective and insight in a year when Board-related issues were making front-page news across the country.
Our shareholders deserve a special word of appreciation for their understanding that SunTrust is not entirely immune to market forces.
Finally, to our customers, thank you for your business. We remain committed to meeting your financial services needs.
