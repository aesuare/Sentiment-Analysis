 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
We are pleased to report that 2011 was another year of record sales and earnings for Genuine Parts Company. Total Company sales were $12.5 billion and this represents an 11% increase compared to 2010. Net Earnings for the year were $565 million, which is a 19% increase compared to 2010 and earnings per share were $3.58 compared to $3.00 in the prior year, also up 19%.
The 11% revenue increase and 19% improvement in net earnings follow identical results in 2010 and are indicative of the good job that has been done by the GPC Team over the past two years. The combination of effective
internal growth initiatives and generally favorable current market conditions in our businesses give us a degree of optimism as we move into 2012.

FINANCIAL STRENGTH
Genuine Parts Company further strengthened its financial condition in 2011 with increased net income, an expanded operating margin and a continued emphasis on effectively managing the balance sheet. Our ongoing asset management and working capital initiatives helped us to maintain a strong cash position, with cash at $525 million at December 31, 2011. For the year, cash from operations totaled approximately $625 million and, after dividends paid of $276 million and capital expenditures of $103 million, our free cash flow
was approximately $245 million. At December 31, 2011,
our total debt was $500 million, which was unchanged from the prior year and continues to represent a modest 15% of total capitalization.
During the year we made four strategic bolt-on type acquisitions, and these new businesses positively impacted our Industrial and Electrical segments in 2011 and they will be solid contributors to our 2012 results. Effective January 1, 2012, the Company invested in a 30% stake in Exego, a leading Australasian aftermarket distributor with 430 locations across Australia and New Zealand and annual revenues of approximately $1 billion (US$). We have the option to acquire 100% of the Company upon its meeting certain earnings thresholds, which we expect will occur within two to three years. Strategic acquisitions remain an important part
of our ongoing growth strategy in each of our businesses and we anticipate additional acquisition opportunities in the year ahead.
We also repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of our Company stock in 2011 and we continue to view this as a good use of our cash. As of December 31, 2011, we were authorized to repurchase up to 13.5 million shares, and we expect to
2 continue making opportunistic share repurchases during 2012.
OPERATIONS
We were pleased to produce top line growth in all four of our business segments in 2011. The Automotive Group, our largest segment at 49% of 2011 revenues, reported an 8% sales increase for the year, and this follows a 7% sales increase in 2010. The positive sales trends for the Automotive Group, which primarily represents NAPA AUTO PARTS sales in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, reflect the ongoing solid fundamentals in the automotive aftermarket, including the overall aging of the vehicle population. As we enter 2012, we are optimistic that we can continue to grow our Automotive business at a respectable rate.
The Industrial segment represents 33% of our 2011 revenues,
and they had another very good year in 2011. Motion Industries, our industrial distribution company, generated a 19% sales increase, which follows a 22% increase in sales in 2010. The strong double-digit sales growth at Motion continues to be driven by the combination of good internal growth initiatives and the strength
in the manufacturing sector of the economy. The current level of manufacturing activity in North America appears to be holding
at healthy levels as we turn to 2012, and our expectations are
for another good year in the industrial business. Staying within the manufacturing segment of the economy, EIS, our Electrical/ Electronic distribution company, had another outstanding year
as well. Sales were up 24% following a 30% increase in 2010 and, while we don’t expect EIS to continue to grow at these rates, we do anticipate another good year in 2012.
S.P. Richards, our Office Products Group, reported a 3% increase in revenues in 2011, which is improved from the less than 1% increase in 2010. The industry-wide slowdown in office products consumption has pressured this segment for several years and we were pleased to show some growth in such a difficult environment for the office products industry. As we look ahead to 2012, it appears the industry will continue to be somewhat challenged as a whole, with expectations for a slow recovery in office employment to continue. Under these conditions, we will be relying on our internal sales initiatives for additional progress in this segment.
GPC DIRECTORS
On January 9, 2012, the Board elected Paul D. Donahue, age 55, to the position of President of the Company and at the April 23, 2012 Shareholders Meeting, we are asking the shareholders to elect Mr. Donahue as a new Director of the Company.
As President, Mr. Donahue will be more involved in our corporate- wide operations and initiatives, and he will also continue to
head the U.S. Automotive Parts Group, which he has done so
well since July 2009. Previously, he was Executive Vice President of the Company and prior to that he was President and COO of

S.P. Richards, our Office Product Group. Mr. Donahue’s leadership abilities and breadth of business experience have made him a valuable contributor to the Company and they are sure to make him an excellent choice as Director and President. We look forward to him serving with us in these capacities.
MANAGEMENT
Over the last year, there were a number of management
changes and promotions that we would like to share with you. In consideration of Paul Donahue’s promotion, we are pleased to tell you that Lee A. Maher, age 56, and Scott W. LeProhon, age 47, were given expanded roles to further strengthen the Automotive Group’s management team. Effective January 2012, Mr. Maher added the title of Chief Operating Officer to his title of Executive Vice President of the U.S. Automotive Parts Group. As EVP, he spent the last two years working very closely with the field operations and, combined with the additional key automotive positions Mr. Maher has held in his 35 years with the Company, he is well qualified for leading the group’s day to day operations as COO. Mr. LeProhon was promoted to Executive Vice President-Merchandising and Product Strategy, also effective this January. In addition to his current role involving merchandising and product strategy, he will be responsible for the Altrom Import Parts and GPC Global Sourcing business units.
Mr. LeProhon has been with the Company for 25 years and has done a fine job for us in each of his automotive management roles.
Staying within the automotive business, William J. Westerman
III, age 45, was named President of our Rayloc division in October 2011. In his seven years with Rayloc, Mr. Westerman has served as General Manager and most recently was Vice President-Operations. He has done an outstanding job for us and we are excited to have him in his new role. Mr. Westerman replaces J. Scott Mosteller,
age 51, who was named Executive General Manager of the Exego Group in Australia, where he is tasked to both learn their automotive business as well as to share our NAPA strategies and initiatives with Exego.
At Motion Industries, M. Wayne Law, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer-US, and Thomas S. Robertshaw, Senior Vice President-Marketing and COO-Industrial Supplies and Services, retired from the Company at the end of 2011. Mr. Law had served
in his most recent role since 2009 and has also successfully held several other key positions in his 43 year career at Motion. Likewise, Mr. Robertshaw admirably served the Company for 36 years, holding
a variety of important management roles. We want to congratulate both of these individuals on their retirements and thank them for their leadership and contributions to the Company. Timothy P. Breen, age 51, has assumed the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer – U.S. Mr. Breen’s extensive experience in the industry dates back 30 years and over this time he has served in a number of key leadership roles at Motion, most recently as Senior Vice President and Group Executive of our North Group.
Lastly, we are pleased to tell you that at our February 20, 2012 Board meeting, the Directors elected Treg S. Brown, age 51, Senior Vice President-Planning and Acquisitions. Mr. Brown has been instrumental in leading our acquisition initiatives during his 17 years with the Company and we look forward to his continued contributions in this very important strategic area for us.
CONCLUSION
Genuine Parts Company had another excellent year in 2011, highlighted by double-digit sales and earnings growth and record sales and earnings per share for the second consecutive year. We are very proud of the job that was done throughout our organization.
We enter 2012 with a continued commitment to growing sales and earnings, generating solid cash flows and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Further progress in each of these important areas will keep the Company moving ahead and they will help to ensure another successful year in 2012.
We want to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to our employees, customers, vendors and shareholders for their commitment to and ongoing support of Genuine Parts Company.
