 To Our Shareholders,
2013 was a successful year for The Hanover. We made important progress across our organization, further strengthening our financial foundation and our market position, as we advanced our goal to become a world class property and casualty insurer—one that can consistently deliver top-quartile returns.
Our company has never been better positioned to succeed. Following a period of significant investments, we have created a broad and innovative product portfolio,
a strong national distribution platform and deep partnerships with a select group of the best agents and brokers in our business that reach every significant geographic market in the U.S. We are now poised
to leverage the investments we made in our organization and to deliver even greater value to our agent partners, their customers and our shareholders.
Our financial results for the year
were strong. We delivered improved underwriting performance, while building

our balance sheet and capital strength.
We were equally pleased with the important progress we made on our strategic priorities during the year, and how that progress positions us for further margin expansion and growth going forward.
While we recognize there is more to be accomplished to achieve our ultimate financial goals, we are very pleased with the substantial progress we made in 2013.

DEMONSTRATING THE FINANCIAL POWER OF THE BUSINESS WE BUILT
2013 operating income was $227 million,
or $5.06 per share, resulting in a return on shareholders’ equity of 10%. While we, along
  2 | THE HANOVER INSURANCE GROUP 2013 ANNUAL REPORT

 with the entire industry, benefited from relatively good weather last year, the noteworthy driver of our success was the strong underlying performance in each of our businesses.
Setting aside the impact of catastrophe losses, our operating income before taxes1 increased by 20%, to $533 million in 2013, demonstrating the earnings power inherent in the organization. Equally as important, we delivered on our expectation of a 94% combined ratio, excluding catastrophes1, an improvement of more than two points over 2012. Our underlying underwriting performance continued to produce profits above industry averages.
In our domestic business, we improved
our combined ratio, excluding catastrophes1, by three points, driving an increase of more than $100 million in our underwriting margin and underscoring the strong potential of
our domestic franchise.
Looking beyond domestic operations, Chaucer once again produced very strong results for the year, proving to be an outstanding investment since its acquisition in July 2011, as it has contributed total cumulative operating income before
taxes of $320 million and significantly diversified our risks.

We also continued to strengthen the balance sheet during the year through effective capital management strategies, thoughtful investment management
and prudent reserving. We ended the year in an excellent capital position. All of our financial strength indicators were at or better than target levels, demonstrating substantial improvement year over year.
As of year-end 2013, our book value per share was $59.43. Excluding net unrealized investment gains, it grew by 8% per share in 2013, reflecting strong earnings for the year, as well as the impact of our capital management initiatives. During the year, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million common shares, or 4% of shares outstanding at the prior year-end, for an average price of $48.26 per share.
Additionally, the strength of our position allowed the Board of Directors to increase the quarterly shareholder dividend by 12%. In total, we paid $60 million in shareholder dividends, which, along with very strong stock price appreciation, puts us among the top five companies in the property and casualty industry for total shareholder returns in 2013.

 RECOGNIZING MEANINGFUL STRATEGIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS
2013 was a pivotal year for us. After
a number of years of significant investments in new geographic markets and product breadth, the past year was more about further refining our business mix and portfolio and leveraging our capabilities.
First, we continued our mix management actions, positioning our portfolio to deliver more consistent results through the cycle.
We reduced volatility by lowering property concentrations in certain geographic markets and making coverage modifications. We are beginning to
see the benefits of our actions, in particular in our catastrophe ratios, which were better on a relative basis and lower than industry averages during the year.

 At the same time, we continued to improve the quality and earnings potential of our product portfolio.
We shifted our mix to higher-margin segments and businesses, and executed targeted underwriting actions to eliminate lower-margin business.
In the aggregate, our underwriting and exposure management initiatives reduced domestic premiums by approximately $200 million, or 6% for the full year 2013, and $320 million since the beginning
of 2012. Despite these initiatives, we still reported growth for the year of approximately 2% in domestic lines and 4% overall.
Second, we achieved strong pricing increases throughout the year in both commercial and personal lines. More importantly, in this dynamic market environment, we continued to approach
price changes in a thoughtful and targeted manner, minimizing disruption, while improving the overall quality of our book. As a result, we finished the year with overall price increases of 9% in commercial lines and 8% in personal lines. Customer retention ratios remained strong in both lines, after adjusting for our exposure reduction initiatives.
While we anticipate industry rate increases will likely moderate in 2014, we believe our commercial book of business, which is targeted to the smaller end of the market, and our focus on selling value, will soften the influence of overall market trends.
Third, with Chaucer, we have built on a very strong franchise, enhancing the breadth of our specialty offering. Specifically, we added additional capabilities to the casualty treaty, marine and property lines. We maintain very strong underwriting and proven leadership
THE HANOVER INSURANCE GROUP 2013 ANNUAL REPORT | 7

 positions in most lines we write within Lloyd’s, which enable us to manage challenging market conditions effectively. Additionally, we are beginning to connect our partner agents to our Lloyd’s platform, capturing attractive U.S. opportunities together.
TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF OPPORTUNITIES IN
A DYNAMIC MARKETPLACE
As we move into 2014, we are in the best position we ever have been to produce increasingly higher returns. We have the operating platform, the product breadth, and the position with our distribution partners to deliver strong profitability and growth.
Offering Innovative Products
Our personal lines business is poised
to capitalize on expanding market opportunities. We focus on selling value and writing account business, which now represents approximately 75%
of our personal lines book, and provides customers with comprehensive coverages and quality insurance protection. Our new Hanover Platinum product, which
we launched in eight states in 2013 and expect to roll out in additional markets
in 2014, provides a distinctive service and coverage offering that should enable us
to write more attractive account business and further improve our position with partner agents, especially those that serve the most attractive personal lines segments.
Our core commercial lines business is equally well positioned in the small commercial and middle markets. In both, we leverage our focus on solutions specifically designed for
   8 | THE HANOVER INSURANCE GROUP 2013 ANNUAL REPORT

 individual industry classes and, together with our strong local field presence,
we help our agent partners capitalize on emerging growth opportunities.
Our domestic specialty offering represents an increasing competitive advantage for us. Over the past several years, we have established a portfolio
of specialty businesses that are relevant to the best retail agents in the country. We provide our partner agents with specialized products and services, such
as management and professional liability, as well as offerings that enable us to capitalize on rapidly expanding market segments, like healthcare and technology.
Finally, Chaucer provides a direct link for our partner agents to the market at Lloyd’s. This enables our most sophisticated partners to meet more of their customers’ specialized insurance needs.
Providing Franchise Value for Partner Agents
Over the last several years, we have established strong and mutually beneficial partnerships with many of the very best independent agents
and brokers in the industry. Our national

and growing with us, will drive greater value over time. We provide our partners with exclusive access to our products and services, extending meaningful franchise value, which allows them to further differentiate their agencies in their respective markets.
Our unique distribution strategy resonates with winning agents and brokers. Today, we write over 80%
of our domestic business with our top 1,000 partners, creating a strong alignment of interest between us.
By virtue of the strong relationships we have built with a limited number
of agent partners, we have developed an unparalleled knowledge of our agents’ businesses, which, along with our flexible, local infrastructure, allows us to react quickly and seize attractive opportunities in the market. We also believe that our agency partnerships will help minimize the effect of slowing rate increases and disruption from changes in the competitive landscape.
