LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
In our initial letter to Chesapeake's shareholders last year, we described how the
combination of our large undeveloped leasehold inventory, our drilling expertise, and

our strengthened balance sheet would generate substantial growth in the company's
assets, production, cash flow and earnings. We are pleased to report that substantial

growth did occur, and we believe Chesapeake is well-positioned to continue its
growth in fiscal 1 995 and heyond.

CHESAPEAKE'S STRATEGY: GROWTH THROUGH THE DRILLBIT

\X/e believe the strategy most likely to meet our goal is to drill new weiis rather than to
purchase other companies' old wells. \X'Te call this strategy "growth through the drillbit"

and it is the foundation of all that we do. This strategy of growth through the drillhit
and management's ownership of approximately 50% of the company are the two most important characteristics distinguishing Chesapeake from its competitors.

Our geoscientists and landmen have demonstrated the necessary skill to acquire

drilling rights in areas where the economic returns from drilling new wells have
proven to be greater than the returns from competing in the crowded acquisitions
DRILLING ACTIVITY

market. Furthermore, we believe Chesapeake's growth strategy of creating value
through the drillhit is more sustainable than the alternative strategy, where success is defined by paying the highest price for a producing property.
A review of Chesapeake's fiscal 1994 results evidences the success of our strategy.

During the year, Chesapeake drilled 92 wells with a 95% success rate. These new
wells generated net production to the company of 5.2 BCFE, or 51% of Chesapeake's

fiscal 1994 production. In addition, our drilling in 1994 developed net reserves of
41.7 BCFE at a total cost of $20.8 million. This translates into a finding cost of $0.50

GROWTH N MMCFE)

One of the reasons for our increasing rate of growth is the higher percentage of
ownership Chesapeake now retains in its new wells. Because of capital constraints for

most of fiscal 1993, the company drilled only five net wells in Chesapeake's primary

operating areas. However, proceeds from the $25.2 million IPO in February 1993,

the $47.5 million senior note offering in March 1994, and Chesapeake's rapidly
increasing cash flow enabled the company to drill 21 net wells in fiscal 1994. We
anticipate drilling 34 net wells in fiscal 1995, allowing the company to retain a much
larger share of the value our operations team creates.

The combination of our larger working interests and the success of our drilling

in the Navasota River area of the Giddings Field in southern Texas has had a substantial impact on our production. Chesapeake increased its average net production in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994 to 2,160 barrels of oil per day (BOD) and 32 million cubic feet of natural gas per day (MMCFD), 159% and
397% increases over the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993. In addition, our oil and gas

CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION

production per share increased 63% and our proved reserves increased to 23 MCFE

per share, among the highest in our peer group.
TEAMWORK + TECHNOLOGY = SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE

As reflected by the increases in production and reserves and the decreases in unit
operating costs, Chesapeake's operations team performed exceptionally well in fiscal

1994. We expect this performance to continue as we enhance Chesapeake's position as an industry leader by implementing state-of-the-art horizontal drilling techniques
in the Giddings Field.

the Giddings Field. These wells have produced an average of 369 BOD and 5.1

average of six months. The strength of these wells has enabled Chesapeake to lead

its peer group in per-well productivity, an important contributor to meeting our
profitability goals.
Even more impressive are the 13 Giddings wells we have drilled in the Navasota River

area, which was introduced in last year's annual report as one of Chesapeake's "New
Areas". Our first well in Navasota River began producing in February 1994, and since

that time these 13 Navasota River wells have averaged 600 BOD and 10.7 MMCFD

and paid out in less than three months. We believe these Navasota River wells are
among the best wells drilled in the onshore U. S. by any company in 1994.

PRIMARY OPERATING AREAS

For the third consecutive year and for the foreseeable future, Chesapeake will focus its drilling activities on the Giddings Field of southern Texas arid the Golden Trend

Field of southern Oklahoma. in these fields, the company has developed a
competitive advantage through its proprietary land tnd geophysical assets and its

expertise in advanced drilling techniques. By utilizing sophisticated drilling and

4

APEAKE ENERGY CORPORATON

completion technologies in the appropriate geological environment, Chesapeake has
lowered its finding and production costs, reduced its financial risks, and increased its
perwell reserve recoveries. We further believe Chesapeake's process of value creation

will be sustainable in its primary operating areas for years to come.
THE GIDD!NGS FIELD

Chesapeake's most important assets are located in the Giddings Field, one of the most
active and prolific fields in the nation. Since 1991, Chesapeake, Union Pacific Resources
Company and others have drilled more than 1,000 horizontal wells
CHESAPEAKE UTILIZES ADVANCED HORIZONTAL TECHNOLOGIES IN ITS

in Giddings with a total capital investment in excess of $1 billion.

Giddings is also one of the largest oil and gas fields in the
nation, with a fairway of production 75 miles long and 25 miles
wide. Giddings produces primarily from the Austin Chalk, Buda,
an ci Georgetown formations, Cretaceous-age fractured carbonate

reservoirs found at depths from 7,000 to 16,000 feet. Activity in the field can be divided into two areas-_-the updip portion, with

producing depths above 11 ,000 feet where production is
primarily oil, and the downdip portion, with producing depths
ranging from 11,000 feet to the present limit of 15,000 feet where

production is primarily natural gas.

The financial results and technological expertise associated

who are using horizontal drilling as a method of secondary recovery. These operators

are extracting the remaining oil reserves not recovered from the 7,500 vertical wells

drilled in the updip area during the 1970's and early 1980's. Reserves and financial
results per well are significantly lower in the updip area because of depletion caused by the earlier vertical drilling and by competition for reserves created by the smaller

horizontal drilling units utilized in the updip area.

Chesapeake's drilling expertise and 175,000 gross acre leasehold position have
enabled the company to lead the development of the downdip part of the field during

the past year. The downdip play is characterized by higher reservoir pressures, a

production stream weighted toward natural gas, more intense natural fracturing, and an absence of depletion. In addition, these downdip areas are being developed using

more advanced drilling technologies and larger spacing units. The combination of

higher reservoir quality and more sophisticated drilling practices has generated
outstanding results. For the 13 Navasota River weils drilled in the downdip area, our

finding costs have been $0.27 per MCFE, far lower than the industry average of

$1.09. Equally important, the downdip wells have exhibited significantly flatter
decline curves than the updip wells.

We believe Chesapeake has "broken the code" in the downdip Austin Chalk by
developing a drilling strategy built around three distinguishing characteristics. First,
Chesapeake has acquired large contiguous leasehold blocks. This allows Chesapeake

to establish 700 to 1,000 acre drilling units resulting in wells that are spaced approximately one mile apart. These large spacing units help to protect against
drainage from offsetting wells. By comparison, the typical spacing pattern for an
updip well is 200 to 400 acres with wells commonly spaced one-half mile apart, thus
increasing the likelihood of competition for reserves.

Secondly, Chesapeake has developed the drilling experience and geological
expertise within the field to identi1r the most prolific 15 to 20 foot sections of the
100 foot thick lower Austin Chalk formation. Chesapeake identifies these sections
through the integration of seismic interpretation with logging-while-drilling gamma
ray tools to ensure that the drillbit stays within these narrowly defined pay zones. The

company's expertise in identifying and drilling within the most productive intervals
of the Austin ChalL has helped Chesapeake enjoy higher per-well recoveries than any

of its competitors in Giddings during the last eighteen months.

Finally, Chesapeake has participated in and contributed to the rapid rate of
technological progress in horizontal drilling tools. Innovations in downhole motors,

measurement-while-drilling tools, drilibit designs, and multiple lateral welibore
drilling have enabled Chesapeake to reduce its drilling costs per horizontal foot by

almost 60% since 1992. The company's expertise and creativity with this rapidly

expanding technology have helped Chesapeake expand the boundaries of the downdip play in Giddings to 15,000 feet, creating significant additional drilling
opportunities. In 1995, Chesapeake intends to further expand this downdip limit.

THE INITIAL DOWNDIP PLAY: FAYETTE COUNTY

Chesapeake has divided the downdip play in the Giddings Field into three areas:
Fayette, Navasota River and independence. In August 1991, Chesapeake acquired
development rights to the 15,000-acre GeoSouthern block, our first acreage holding

in the downdip Fayette area. After successfully drilling 12 wells on this block, we

contributed the remaining undeveloped portion of the GeoSouthern acreage into a
20,000 acre joint venture with Union Pacific in October 1993. In this joint venture,

Union Pacific and Chesapeake have cooperated in pioneering and further
developing the advanced technology of drilling dual opposing

laterals (two horizontal laterals drilled in opposite directions
from the same vertical wellbore) and dual stacked laterals (two

horizontal laterals drilled in the same direction but at different
depths from the same vertical weilbore). To date, 11

wells have been drilled in this joint venture,
generating cumulative gross production of 15 BCFE
and estimated remaining reserves of 37 BCFE. For fiscal

block. Adjacent to and on structural strike with the LCRA
block, Chesapeake has also acquired 5,000 gross acres in the Fayetteville prospect.

Drilling on these blocks is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of fiscal 1995

after our 3-D seismic data has been processed. For fiscal 1995, Chesapeake has
budgeted $4 million to drill three net (11 gross) wells in these two areas, leaving six potential wells to be drilled in fiscal 1996 and beyond.

Chesapeake is acquiring other acreage in the Fayette area and we believe this
portion of the downdip Giddings Field will continue to play an important role in the
company's future drilling plans.

THE SECOND DOWNDIP PLAY: NAVASOTA RIVER

Chesapeake believes its 13 wells in Navasota River demonstrate that this 45,000 acre

block in the downdip portion of the Giddings Field may represent the best drilling

opportunity in the United States. The Navasota River leasehold block, located in
Brazos and Grimes Counties, Texas, was introduced in the "New Areas" section of last

year's annual report. We were hopeful that the drilling results in Navasota River would be as attractive as those we had experienced in the downdip Fayette area.

However, the results from the 13 wells in Navasota River have significantly
exceeded our expectations. Gross reserves

per well have been estimated by our independent reservoir engineers to
exceed an average of eight BCFE. For fiscal 1995, Chesapeake has budgeted
$18 million to drill lime net (24 gross)

could add signifIcantly to the company's oil and gas reserves. However, as with Navasota River last year, we have not included any reserve value from the
Independence area in this year's reserve report.

ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES

Although the Austin Chalk is the primary target of almost all horizontal wells in the Giddings Field, the Buda and Georgetown formations, other fractured carbonates of
the Cretaceous age, are located within 1,000 feet of the base of the Austin Chalk. We

believe the geological conditions that created the fracturing in the Austin Chalk also created similar fracturing in the Buda and Georgetown.

In May 1992, Chesapeake drilled the first producing horizontal Georgetown well in Grimes County, near the town of lola, Texas. This well, located 15 miles north of
Chesapeake's main Navasota River block, has produced approximately 2.8 BCFE in two years. As importantly, the well continues to produce in excess of its initial daily

production rate of 3.4 MMCFD. In March 1994, Chesapeake drilled a vertical well
20 miles to the south of lola on the southern edge of the main Navasota River block
to further test the potential of the Georgetown. This vertical well tested 1.2 MMCFD from the Georgetown before being plugged back to establish initial production of 7.4

MMCFD from the Austin Chalk.
We believe these two wells provide evidence that the Buda and Georgetown may

prove productive under a large portion of Chesapeake's 175,000 gross acres in the
downdip Giddings play. To further evaluate our theory, Chesapeake has budgeted $2

million in fiscal 1995 to drill two horizontal Buda and Georgetown wells in a 50/50 joint venture with Snyder Oil Corporation.
THE GOLDEN TREND

Chesapeake's second primary operating area is the Golden Trend Field of southern Oklahoma, one of the most active fields in the Mid-Continent region of the nation.

During the last ten years, Chesapeake, Arnerada Hess, Anadarko, Mobil, Phillips,
OXY and others have drilled more than 450 wells in the Golden Trend with a total
capital investment of approximately $400 million.

CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATON

Wells in the Golden Trend Field have many attractive characteristics, including reserves that are long-lived and weighted 85% towards liquids-rich natural gas. in

addition, drilling costs are predictable and controllable, and multiple zone
completions reduce geological and financial risk. Chesapeake has developed a

significant geological and engineering niche in the Golden Trend, enabling the
company to generate attractive finding costs and low lifting costs. Chesapeake excels

in the drilling of these technically-demanding deep wells. In fact, in fiscal 1994, our
30 Golden Trend wells averaged 13,500 feet in depth, making Chesapeake the leader in average well depth drilled in Oklahoma.

Moreover, the company's land position in the
Golden Trend continues to grow. After beginning

the year with 150 undrilled locations in our Golden Trend

inventory and after drilling 30 wells (23 operated by
Chesapeake and seven by Anadarko), Chesapeake still controls

FIELD OFFICE LINDSAY, OK

more than 150 undrilled Golden Trend locations. For fiscal
1995, Chesapeake has budgeted $11 million to drill 12 net (50

As in Giddings, Chesapeake continues to deepen the downdip limits of the Golden

Trend Field. In fiscal 1994, Chesapeake drilled the first two wells that established

production below 15,000 feet from the Sycamore, Woodford, Hunton, and Viola
formations in the Knox area of the Golden Trend.
KNOX

Knox is the second "New Area" we would like to introduce in this report. Knox is a
southwest extension to the Golden Trend and represents a significant opportunity for

Chesapeake to further increase the company's reserves. In fiscal 1995, through our

Knox area development, Chesapeake will become the first company to establish

10

production from below 16,000 feet in the Sycamore, Woodford, Hunton and Viola

formations in the Golden Trend. Our success in Knox demonstrates Chesapeake's
ability to leverage its geological, engineering, and land expertise into new areas that
have the potential to increase proved reserves.

SHOLEM ALECHEM

In last year's annual report, we introduced our joint venture with Texaco iii the
Sholem Alechem area in Oklahoma as the second "New Area" after Navasota River.

The Sholem Alechem area is located within southern Oklahoma's giant Sho-Vel-

Turn Field. This field has produced more than one billion barrels of oil and one
trillion cubic feet of gas since its discovery more than 80 years ago. We have drilled

two successful wells in the Sholem Alechem joint venture and have budgeted $2
million to drill two net (six gross) wells in fiscal 1995. If this year's drilling activities

are successful, we believe the Sholem Alechem area is large enough to support the

drilling of more than 50 horizontal wells. We believe our horizontal drilling joint
venture with Texaco also demonstrates Chesapeake's ability to utilize its expertise in

CONSISTENT STRATEGY

GOLDEN TREND )Averge depth

Our decision to reproduce last year's cover and continue the conservative theme for Chesapeake's annual report is evidence of the consistency of our corporate strategy.
Since Chesapeake's inception in 1 989, all of the company's reserves and assets have

been built through drilling activities. We plan to continue this proven strategy of
growth through the drillbit. Our plan centers on an aggressive undeveloped leasehold acquisition program. It

currently provides a three-year inventory of undrilled locations on which we
intend to utilize advanced horizontal and vertical drilling technologies to generate

continuing production and reserve growth. We believe this strategy will create
substantial value for our shareholders.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE

As impressive as our growth has been in fiscal 1994, we believe we have the
appropriate strategy and infrastructure to improve further in fiscal 1995. Our large

undeveloped acreage inventory, improving drilling technologies, and creative,

CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION

dedicated employee/shareholders should enable Chesapeake to reach our goals for

fiscal 1995. Furthermore, because management owns approximately 50% of
Chesapeake's stock, shareholders can be assured that we will remain focused on
growth in reserves, cash flow, and earnings per share.

We again express our gratitude to our Board of Directors who have provided
excellent counsel through their collective experience and business acumen. They have

provided Chesapeake with invaluable insight and perspective during this period of
exceptional growth. We also appreciate the talent and work ethic of our employees, all

of whom are recognized on pages 14 and 15 of this report.
We also express our gratitude to our fellow shareholders. Our job is to make money

for you and we will remain dedicated to this challenge. We promise to continue to

work hard and make Chesapeake the standard by which other independent energy
companies are measured.
