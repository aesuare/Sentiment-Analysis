dear fellow
SHAREHOLDERS
2009 will be remembered as the worst economic decline since the Great Depression. Companies around the world changed their focus from growth to survival. Advertising- related businesses, often leading economic indicators, were severely impacted given the sharp downturn in advertising spending.
Further magnifying the local
TV ad market decline was the
cyclical reduction in non-election
year political advertising and the unprecedented decline experienced by the automotive industry, historically our top ad category. The negative economic forces significantly impacted so many outstanding
local businesses that had grown
to become the cornerstone of our
advertiser base. Virtually all of our customers were impacted.
For the team here at LIN, it was critical for us to develop a plan
that recognized the conditions, yet ensured our continuing commitment to local programming, excellent sales service and our transformation to a multimedia company. Fortunately, prior to the crisis, we had identified the need to remake the business of local media and were in the midst
of executing our plan. The economic crisis increased the sense of urgency throughout the organization and our team dramatically accelerated our transformation timeline. The poor economy drove several of our local media competitors to reduce the quality and amount of local news. Our opportunity was to produce more local programming for our TV, web and mobile outlets, yet do so using fewer resources and maintain our high quality standards.
During 2009, capital was scarce and company valuations were
significantly reduced. This created a
“...2009 was a significant year, when LIN TRANSFORMED into
fees, we will continue to effectively develop and purchase the best programming relative to cable networks. Undoubtedly, television is the greatest advertising platform!
To summarize, 2009 was a significant year, when LIN transformed into a multimedia company. We produced more local programs, and not only news, but local multiplatform entertainment programs like The Rhode Show and Connecticut Style, more online
content and now a growing mobile business as well, all at a significantly lower cost structure....and achieved record results.
What a difference a year makes! There are many challenges and opportunities in 2010. If 2009 has taught us anything, we know we need to constantly challenge our historical business processes, yet remain committed to excellence
in content, client service and technology. I believe LIN Media will
achieve excellent cash flow growth
in 2010 as a result of an improving economy, the return of political races, continued growth in our digital businesses and a lower cost base.
I look forward to keeping you updated throughout the year.
Sincerely,
Vincent L. Sadusky
