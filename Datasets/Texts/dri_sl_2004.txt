Leadership Defined
 To Our Shareholders, Employees, and Guests
  I welcome this opportunity to share with you our fiscal 2004 results. It was clearly a challenging year, with uncertainties such as the war in Iraq, the continuing threat of terrorism, and lackluster job growth affecting our industry and our Company. Our Company was also challenged by management transition in key positions.
Consumer confidence was volatile throughout the year, and the casual dining industry, while showing some growth, did not experience the robust sales growth we had anticipated. And, while we are stronger following our executive leadership changes, we experienced some transition disruption as new responsibilities and reporting relation- ships were established, which adversely affected our performance.
Despite the challenges, we achieved a great deal in fiscal 2004 and remain focused on our long-term objective of providing industry- leading shareholder value.
• Sales increased 7.5 percent to $5 billion for the fiscal year, driven primarily by new restaurant growth at Olive Garden and Smokey Bones,same-restaurantsalesgrowthatOliveGarden,andan additional operating week in the fourth quarter.
• Net earnings were $231.5 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, for the 53-week fiscal year. These results include fourth quarter asset impairment and restructuring charges totaling approximately $23.1 million after tax associated with the closing of six Bahama Breeze restaurants and the write-down of the carrying value of four other Bahama Breeze restaurants, one Olive Garden restau- rant, and one Red Lobster restaurant.
• As described in the 2004 Financial Highlights, net earnings for the fiscal year excluding the asset impairment and restructuring charges were $254.5 million, or $1.50 per diluted share, on 53-week sales of $5.0 billion. Last year, net earnings were $232.3 million, or $1.31 per diluted share, on 52-week sales of $4.7 billion.
• Red Lobster’s total sales were a record $2.44 billion, a 0.1 percent increase from last year. Average annual sales per restaurant were $3.6 million (on a 52-week basis), and Red Lobster built seven net new restaurants. Red Lobster’s new leadership team is in place and working to improve operating efficiency and sharpen the position- ing of the brand, while achieving sustainable and profitable growth.
• Olive Garden’s total sales were a record $2.21 billion, up 11.1 percent from last year. Operating profit also reached new record levels, with a double-digit increase versus last year. Average annual sales per restaurant were a record $4.1 million (on a 52-week basis), and Olive Garden built 19 net new restaurants. Olive Garden’s U.S. same-restaurant sales growth for the year was 4.6 percent, and OliveGardenendedtheyearwith39consecutivequarters of same-restaurant sales growth. Olive Garden continues to demonstrate how strong brand positioning, brilliance with the basics of in-restaurant operations, compelling food news, and great advertising combine to drive excellent guest satisfaction, as well as strong growth in sales, traffic, and operating profit.
• Bahama Breeze’s total sales of $176 million were up 28 percent from last year. In May 2004, Bahama Breeze closed six underperforming restaurants as part of our plan to improve overall profitability,

leaving 32 restaurants in operation at the end of the fiscal year. Average annual sales per restaurant, excluding the closed restau- rants, were $5.2 million in fiscal 2004 (on a 52-week basis).
• Smokey Bones’ total sales were $174 million, an 87 percent increase from last year, as the company nearly doubled in size this year by adding 30 new restaurants to its base of 39. Smokey Bones continued to drive strong consumer acceptance through its unique combination of slow-smoked barbeque and a variety of other grilled favorites, served in a lively yet comfortable mountain- lodge atmosphere, where guests can watch their favorite sports. Annual sales averaged $3.2 million per restaurant (on a 52-week basis) and expansion will continue in fiscal 2005 as it seeks to take advantage of a compelling opportunity.
• Seasons 52, the casually sophisticated fresh grill and wine bar we’re testing in Orlando, continued to post impressive results. Plans are in place to open two to three more test restaurants in fiscal 2005 to further explore the concept’s viability. Seasons 52 offers seasonally inspired menus with fresh ingredients, to create great tasting, nutritionally balanced meals that are lower in cal- ories than comparable restaurant meals.
• With our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we continued to aggressively buy back shares of our common stock. We repur- chased 10.7 million shares in fiscal 2004, which represented more than $235 million in share repurchases. Since we began our repurchase program in 1996, we have repurchased more than 109 million shares, or more than $1.5 billion of our common stock.
While we are proud of our achievements in fiscal 2004, we know we must strengthen several important aspects of our business. That’s the key to returning to the high level of performance that will create strong long-term value for our shareholders. We approach our improvement opportunities with a solid foundation, one that features an excellent balance of proven and emerging brands. We also have a clearly defined core purpose that motivates us every day – to nourish and delight everyone we serve. And we have a shared goal throughout the Company – we want to be the best in casual dining, now and for generations. We recognize that to achieve our goal, we must build on this strong foundation with even greater attention to two things: operating excellence and effective brand building across the Company.
CASUAL DINING IS A GROWTH INDUSTRY
Our industry, casual dining, is large and continues to grow. In calendar 2003, casual dining industry sales grew 2.6 percent. This compares favorably to the quick-service and mid-scale segments of the restaurant industry, which reported a 1.4 percent increase in sales and a 1.9 percent decline in sales, respectively. However, casual dining’s 2003 results are well below the industry’s 10-year average growth rate of 7.4 percent.
Despite the slowdown in calendar 2003, industry experts continue to forecast that annualized casual dining sales growth will be between 5 percent and 7 percent over the next decade. The driving factors have not changed and are as important as ever – growth in total employment, growth in real disposable income, an increasing number of women in the workforce, and the aging demographics of the U.S. population.
These drivers, combined with changing lifestyles that place a premium on the time-saving and social reconnection benefits of dining out, give us great confidence that we are in the right indus- try at the right time. Our confidence is buttressed by the fact that supply and demand within the casual dining industry continue to remain in balance, as they have for the past several years. Although total casual dining visits were down 0.3 percent in calendar 2003, there was an even steeper decline in the number of casual dining units, which fell 2.2 percent. Against that backdrop, it’s important to note that casual dining chains experienced a 1.0 percent increase in units. This continues a trend we’ve seen in recent years and is a strong indicator that well-managed casual dining chains continue to grow and take market share from independent restaurant operators.
OUR SOLID FOUNDATION
As I’ve said, our business is built on a strong foundation, starting with our compelling core purpose, to nourish and delight everyone we serve. Darden also has seven core values that have been forged over our 65-year heritage, which started with the early businesses of our late founder, Bill Darden. We value:
• Integrity and fairness
• Respect and caring
• Diversity
• Always learning / always teaching • Being “of service”
• Teamwork • Excellence

Leadership Defined
 These values serve as a constant reminder of who we are, and they guide every decision we make and everything we do. We believe values-based leadership and a values-based organization are more important than ever as predicates for success in today’s business environment.
Our foundation also includes a strategic framework that has been in place for nearly six years now and has helped us build a solid track record of success. This framework consists of four strategic impera- tives – leadership excellence at all levels, brand building excellence, service and hospitality excellence and culinary and beverage excel- lence. There are also two strategic enablers we believe can help us accelerate progress in each of the strategic imperatives. These enablers are diversity excellence that embraces and builds upon our differences, and process and technology excellence that maxi- mizes organizational effectiveness and drives both discipline and nimbleness. These important elements – our strategic imperatives and enablers – remain unchanged and rock solid.
New to our strategic framework is the explicit statement of two points that have been implicit in our approach to the business for many years now, and that we believe separate us from much of our competition. We are committed to: (1) being a multi-brand restau- rant company bound together by common operating practices and a unifying culture, which serve to make us stronger than the sum of our parts; and (2) listening to our guests and employees for the insights we need to create powerful, broadly appealing brands and develop highly successful people.
We are confident we will create enduring guest and employee loyalty and deliver strong financial performance by combining our strong foundation with consistent brilliance with the basics in everything we pursue, especially our strategic imperatives. We are proud to highlight one of those strategic imperatives in this year’s annual report – leadership excellence at all levels of Darden – and introduce you to some of the finest leaders in casual dining.
FISCAL 2005 PRIORITIES
To achieve our financial objectives and continue building our momentum toward becoming the best in casual dining, we will focus our attention and resources on four critical priorities in fiscal 2005: • Increasing leadership effectiveness
• Driving more growth across all of our brands
• Improving our brand-building efforts
• Fully utilizing our resources
These priorities have been established with the purpose of putting Darden squarely on the path toward growth. Progress on these priorities will increase operating consistency, reinforce leadership effectiveness and stability, and ignite stronger growth.
STRONG LEADERSHIP
A critical element of effective leadership is having a thoughtful succession plan that provides for a smooth and effective transition of leadership to talented, dynamic and seasoned executives. I am pleased that the Board of Directors has appointed Smokey Bones President Clarence Otis as my successor as Chief Executive Officer, and Olive Garden President Drew Madsen as Darden President and Chief Operating Officer effective December 2004. I will continue to serve as Chairman until my retirement in December 2005.
Our succession plan is the result of years of planning by our Board of Directors, made possible by Darden’s deep bench strength. Both Clarence and Drew have been with Darden for many years and have a wide breadth of business acumen and restaurant industry experience. They are talented executives with complementary strengths, mutual respect, and a demonstrated ability to work as an effective team. Their passion for our business will serve us well in the years ahead.
WE ARE READY TO GROW
I am convinced that Darden is well positioned for growth. We start with more than 141,000 dedicated employees who are committed to nourishing and delighting everyone we serve. And we add to that an extraordinarily broad guest base that reflects our balanced mix of two large, dominant companies that each generate over $2 billion in annual sales, and two smaller, emerging growth companies that we believe are each capable of ultimately achieving annual sales of $500 million or more.
Our loyal employees and guests, along with our leadership and financial resources, provide us with an excellent platform to grow and to achieve our ultimate objective, which is to be the best in casual dining, now and for generations.
