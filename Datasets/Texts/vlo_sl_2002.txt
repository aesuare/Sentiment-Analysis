 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
While 2002 was a difficult year for the refining industry, it was a year of major accomplishments at Valero.
The acquisition of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock (UDS) at the close of 2001 made Valero the largest independent refining and marketing company in the United States. The acquisition tripled our assets, doubled our revenues, and increased our employee headcount by almost seven times!
Today we have the most complex and geographically diverse refining system in North America with 12 refineries stretching from California to Canada, 4,100 retail and branded wholesale sites, a stake in 4,800 miles of crude oil and product pipelines and approximately 20,000 employees. It’s hard to believe that it’s been less than six years since Valero had only a single 170,000 barrel-per-day (BPD) refinery on the Gulf Coast and just 215 employees!
We are proud of this tremendous growth, not only because it gives Valero the size and scope to remain competitive in a rapidly consolidating industry, but also because we have been able to integrate our new employees and assets effectively and efficiently—without losing the special “caring and sharing” spirit that has been the cornerstone of Valero’s unique culture and success for the past 23 years.
The fact that Valero was once again named as “One of The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America” by Fortune magazine is a testament to the tremendous success of our integration effort. This is evidenced by the fact that two- thirds of the scoring for this honor is based on confidential surveys completed by our employees, 80 percent of whom have been with the company a year or less!
One of the other great accomplishments in 2002 was our highly successful systems integration, which we achieved in a record nine months. This full conversion to a common SAP system is critically important because it gives us the timely information we need to make better business decisions and to control costs more effectively.
Another really big accomplishment in 2002 was the identification and implementation of $235 million in recurring synergies and $85 million in non-recurring synergies. These savings helped offset some of the impact of the year’s challenging earnings environment. In 2003, we expect to achieve an additional $100 million of recurring synergies and another $80 million in non-recurring synergies as well. These synergies should have a much more dramatic impact on our bottom line in 2003 with the improved margin environment that is anticipated.
We will also benefit from several capital projects, which we completed in 2002, that should add more than $100 million to operating income in 2003.

2002 AN ANOMALY
While we are proud of our significant achievements in 2002, it was a tough year for the refining industry. The year got off to a rough start as the economy was still reeling from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. We also experienced the warmest winter in the Northeast in a century. These two factors substantially reduced both oil and refined product demand, which resulted in poor refined product margins. The sluggish demand also caused OPEC to shut in crude oil production, which substantially reduced the production of heavy, sour crude oil and resulted in extremely narrow sour crude oil discounts.
In addition to all of these difficult market conditions, we also had six of our 12 refineries down for required maintenance in the first quarter of 2002. Given all of these factors, it is not surprising that we lost money in the first quarter. However, Valero employees can take great pride in the fact that we made money each and every quarter the rest of
the year—despite the dismal margin environment. We ended the year with revenues of $27 billion, operating income of $471 million, and net income of $92 million or $.83 per share. And, I am proud to say that despite the challenging market conditions, Valero still outperformed its peers, as well as the S&P 500 Index, in shareholder return. Valero’s shareholder return was down by only 3.5 percent, while the Dow Jones Energy Index was down 15.4 percent, and the S&P 500 Index was down 23 percent.
The good news is that 2003 is shaping up to be a record year for Valero. Refined product margins are at historically high levels and are expected to remain strong throughout the year—supported by good consumer demand, coupled with lower-than-average inventory levels that are largely the result of a colder-than-normal winter, the Venezuelan Oil Worker’s Strike, and the historically high level of planned maintenance at U.S. refineries in the first quarter of 2003.
Meanwhile, Valero has only one refinery scheduled for major maintenance this year. So, while other refineries are down, we’ll be producing and benefiting from the strong margin environment. In fact, total throughput volumes are expected to be up 10 percent over last year.
Valero is also benefiting from widening sour crude oil discounts as Venezuelan crude oil has begun returning to the market and OPEC production has increased. For example, the discount for Arab Medium sour crude oil was $2.50 per barrel in April of 2002. It has more than doubled to $5.30 per barrel for April of 2003. This is really important because every $1.00 improvement in the sour crude oil discount improves our earnings by about $2.00 per share.
These improved market conditions have already resulted in a 10 percent increase in our stock price so far this year.
LONG-TERM OUTLOOK JUST AS BULLISH
And the long-term outlook for the refining industry—and for Valero in particular—is just as bullish.
Since 1981, the number of U.S. refineries has been cut in half—from 324 to 141. And there is no substantial new capacity coming on-line. In fact, the lower sulfur gasoline and diesel specifications imposed by the federal government, which will go into effect in the next few years, are expected to reduce gasoline

 volumes in the U.S. by 100,000 BPD and distillate volumes by 320,000 BPD. These costly sulfur reduction modifications are also expected to result in the closure of a number of smaller refineries and the tighter fuel specifications are expected to result in reduced refined product imports into the U.S. As a result, U.S. demand growth is expected to outpace capacity growth in the coming years. This should result in a better-than-average margin environment, which is important because every $1.00 improvement in our system’s average refining margin, improves per share earnings by about $4.00.
And, as crude oil production increases in the coming years, heavy, sour crude oil production is expected to outpace sweet crude oil production by a four-to-one ratio, which should translate into high sour crude oil discounts going forward.
A NEW ERA FOR REFINING
So, while many talk about the volatility of earnings in the refining industry, I believe we have entered into a new era where margins will be higher and where periods of low refining margins will be less frequent and shorter in duration.
While 2002 was a challenging year, 2000 and 2001 were both record years for Valero and now 2003 is shaping up to be a record year as well. How many industries have done as well? Valero has significantly outperformed its peers, as well as the S&P 500 Index over the last five years. Valero shareholders enjoyed a total cumulative return of 24 percent—far better than the 16 percent return of our peer group and the S&P’s three percent loss!
We are in the right business at the right time. Everything has come together—from low gasoline and distillate inventories, to strong demand, to wider sour crude oil discounts—to create a very bullish outlook. And, no refiner is better positioned to benefit from these long-term bullish fundamentals than Valero.
We will benefit from our geographic diversity and our more diversified business lines. We will also benefit from our leverage to less expensive, heavy sour crude oil feedstocks and the higher-margin, cleaner- burning fuels and premium products we make.
And, most importantly, we will continue to benefit from the hard work and dedication of our 20,000 employees, who are the best in the industry and our number-one asset.
That is why I always say and firmly believe, the best is yet to come!
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD
AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
P.S. While I do believe the best is yet to come, 2003 will be “bittersweet” in one respect. Two of my very favorite long-time executives—Bill Latham, Senior Vice President of Information Services and Chief Information Officer, and John Krueger, Senior Vice President and Controller—both retired at the close of 2002. These two individuals were largely responsible for the systems integration that we accomplished in a record nine months in 2002. And both have been tireless supporters of Valero for many, many years. Both Bill and John truly epitomize the Valero work ethic and standard of excellence, and they will be missed! But we’re thankful for all of their many contributions and wish them all of life’s best in retirement.
