  To Our Shareholders
  
   Avon’s empowering relationships with our almost five million Avon Representatives worldwide are at the heart of our global business model and the source of our unrivaled competitive advantage wherever beauty products are sold.
On the pages of this report, you’ll meet Representatives like Jalin Wood from the United States, Elena Lepeha from Russia, Xiaoyan Wu from China and Hortensia Orozco Romero from Mexico. Each speaks a different language. Each comes from a different culture. Yet all four share the same dream of a better life, and each is making her dream come true as an Avon Representative.

   Sales grew 10% in local currencies and 13% in dollars, reaching a record $7.7 billion.
Since 1999, we’ve been on a journey of transformation to strengthen our relationships with our Representatives, and to help them build their businesses and serve their customers in new, creative and ever-more relevant ways.
From 1999 through 2001, we crafted our transformation vision and strengthened our business foundation. Starting in 2002, we drove bold and speedy implementation of our growth strategies. In 2004, these efforts came to fruition as we completed our second three- year planning cycle and achieved unprecedented business success.
Across all measures, results in 2004 were impressive. Earnings per share advanced 27% to $1.77, the third year in a row in which earnings have increased by 20% or more.
Sales grew 10% in local currencies and 13% in dollars, reaching a record $7.7 billion—an increase of almost $2.5 billion since 1999 when Avon’s transformation began. The sales growth was powered by an exceptional 13% increase in units and an 11% advance in total Representatives, two of the most important performance indicators of our business strength.

 Cash flow from operations in 2004 reached a record $883 million, well ahead of 2003’s level of $745 million, and almost double the level back in 1999. This positive cash generation resulted from the financial power of our business model, and also from the implementation in 2004 of transformational new tax and cash management strategies that are lowering Avon’s effective tax rate from 35% to 31%.
Reflecting both the performance of your company and our confidence in the future, in February 2005, we approved an 18% increase in the dividend on top of last year’s 33% increase, and we also announced a new $1 billion stock repurchase program to further enhance shareholder value.
Global Beauty
The exceptional performance of your company in 2004 was once again fueled by four growth strategies that are the hallmarks of Avon’s continuing transformation.
The first is our focus on Beauty, and we’re very pleased that Beauty sales in 2004 continued to significantly outpace the market, growing an extraordinary 17% on top of the 15% advance in 2003.
Both our color and fragrance businesses benefited from our partnership with internationally acclaimed actress Salma Hayek, and grew 14% and 13%,

respectively, as we repositioned our flagship Avon Color line and entered the prestige fragrance segment with the first introduction in our Today Tomorrow Always trilogy.
In skin care, sales grew an impressive 20% as we solidified our market leadership in the anti-aging segment and achieved an exceptional $600 million in sales for our powerful Anew franchise.
Personal care performed even more strongly, with sales growing an impressive 24%, fueled by the record launch in Europe of our new personal care line, Senses, which is planned for further roll-out starting in 2005.
Powered by these many successes, Avon’s Beauty sales reached an impressive $5.2 billion in 2004, up three points to 69% of the total portfolio versus 2003, with all four categories achieving sales of over $1 billion for the first time—a major milestone in Avon’s beauty transformation.
Global Expansion
Working hand in hand with our focus on Beauty is the equally important strategy of strengthening and expanding Avon’s geographic footprint, a powerful competitive advantage that few other companies can match.

 In 2004, strong sales from our three international regions of Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific more than offset softness in the U.S., where challenges in the toy and gift categories negatively affected results. These categories are being repositioned in 2005, and we expect the U.S. to resume profitable growth in 2006.
Avon does business in more than 120 countries on every continent, and in 2004, exciting and dynamic growth opportunities continued to emerge across the total portfolio.
In Europe, for example, Central and Eastern Europe reached the $1 billion milestone one year ahead of schedule, fueled by 70% sales growth in Russia, on top of a similar gain in 2003. Looking ahead, we expect that sales in Russia will double to $800 million by 2007.
Turkey remained another star performer in the region, growing to almost $100 million in sales and positioning itself to serve as a hub for future geographic expansion in the Middle East in 2007 and beyond.
While continuing to build on our very significant market shares throughout Latin America, we also laid the groundwork for developing a new market cluster involving existing Avon markets such as Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Ecuador as we work to leverage operating efficiencies and unleash further growth.
In Asia Pacific, China grew by 42% in local currencies—on top of 20% growth last year—and we anticipate that this growth will accelerate when the government allows the resumption of direct selling, as anticipated, in 2005. Longer term, China remains Avon’s number-one future growth opportunity, and we see $1 billion in sales potential for this single market alone.
In 2004, we also entered Vietnam and prepared for further expansion in India, our next important area of geographic “white space.”

Global Opportunity
As we expand our global footprint and drive for Beauty leadership, our third major strategy is our commitment to provide a world-class earnings opportunity for our Avon Representatives.
We continue to make progress with the world-wide rollout of Sales Leadership—our multi-level marketing model—and believe it will be a game changer as we strive to create a more compelling, more dynamic direct-selling earnings proposition for career- minded women.
But the big payoff for our Representatives—and for Avon—comes when Leadership is combined with the rigorous application of direct-selling best practices to empower our Representatives to reach more consumers with our products and to extend the benefits of the Avon brand to more women everywhere.
In 2004, we completed a comprehensive global framework that formalizes these best practices, and this framework is now being rolled-out worldwide in conjunction with the implementation of the Sales Leadership strategy.
Global Supply Chain
As our sales strategies gain traction and reach scale by 2008, we anticipate increasing productivity, including further migration to the variable compensation structure of Sales Leadership.
This is consistent with our fourth, and very critical area of strategic focus: Our commitment to reconfigure Avon’s value chain, which will free up resources to fund our growth initiatives, while at the same time supporting expansion of the company’s operating margin.
The ongoing transformation of Avon’s supply chain is a key enabler to value chain reconfiguration. Between 2002 and 2004, improvements in supply chain effectiveness helped fund a $250 million increase in consumer investments while also helping drive a 320 basis-point improvement in operating margin.

The more our transformation progresses, the more opportunities we discover. Supply chain transformation improves service to our Representatives, provides the consumer a more compelling product offering, frees up funds for reinvestment to drive sustained top-line growth,
and delivers enhanced earnings for our shareholders.

  We’ve also completed the blueprint for an integrated global supply chain strategy, supported by ERP (enterprise resource planning) technology.
In 2004, we began to implement a regional supply chain process in Latin America and Asia Pacific, modeled on our earlier success in Europe, where operating margin has advanced by 620 basis points over the most recent three-year period.
We also completed the blueprint for an integrated global supply chain platform, supported by ERP (enterprise resource planning) technology. ERP implementation began in Europe in January 2005, with other regions planned to follow in 2006 and 2007.
We anticipate that our global supply chain strategy will free up an additional $300 million by 2008 as we further reconfigure the value chain.
Looking Ahead
As we come to the end of our second three-year planning cycle and start writing the next chapter of Avon’s transformation, we have a unique vantage point from which to look back to the beginning and also forward to the next horizon.The numbers tell an exciting story.
In 1999, Avon had sales of $5.3 billion; by 2007, we expect that this figure will double to $10 billion. In 1999, operating margin was 9.8%; by 2007, this number should increase to almost 19%, and to 20% by 2008. In 1999, cash flow from operations was $449 million; by 2007, cash flow should increase to $1.5 billion.
In this next cycle, our strategies will not change; but the trajectory we have established will propel us to a true business of scale as we come of age as a global enterprise and achieve an unprecedented level of worldwide success.
We will also come of age as a philanthropic organization as we continue our financial support for the breast cancer cause around the world and elevate our fight against domestic violence to a second initiative of scale.
 We’re entering the third chapter of Avon’s transformation story with higher goals, but also with greater confidence in our ability to deliver on those goals.

  We will also come of age as a philanthropic organization as we continue our support for the breast cancer cause around the world, and elevate our fight against domestic violence to a second initiative of scale.
Looking forward to the opportunities ahead, we find ourselves at an exciting and unprecedented moment in Avon’s history.We begin this new chapter with the wind at our back and extraordinary optimism for what the future might hold. The foundation is in place and the momentum is strong.
As we move forward with this next phase of growth, we do so in partnership with our 48,000 committed Avon associates around the world, and guided by the wisdom and support of Avon’s outstanding Board of Directors, whose extraordinary service to our company and shareholders is greatly appreciated.
Most important, we move forward in partnership with our valued Avon Representatives across the globe. They are truly our inspiration as they motivate us to continually strive to do better and reach higher.
Avon Representative Elena Lepeha wrote that “Avon helped make the dreams of this ordinary Siberian woman come true.” To Elena, Jalin, Xiaoyan and Hortensia—and to the millions of other Representatives just like them—we want to reaffirm our purpose, our pride and our commitment to open new doors of opportunity that empower women throughout the world.
