2006
was a year of record performance for Sonoco,
Shareholders
 reflecting the strength of our balanced portfolio of packaging products and services, solid capital structure and dedication to providing shareholder value. We achieved all-time high sales, net income, cash flow from operations, productivity improve- ment and new product sales, while increasing dividends for the 24th consecutive year, effectively recovering raw material cost increases and other inflationary costs, and further reducing working capital. Furthermore, we improved margins for the third consecutive year. And, most impor- tantly, our shareholders enjoyed a 33.2% total return on their investment, which significantly outpaced the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and the Dow Jones Containers and Packaging Index.
Although pleased with our accomplishments in 2006, we have significant opportunities for improvement. We know that to sustain annual average double-digit total returns for shareholders, we must accelerate top-line growth, both organi- cally and through acquisitions. We know that we must remain vigilant about margin improvement by further improving our position as the low-cost producer, whether through restructuring, consoli- dation or process improvement. We must con- tinue offsetting rising raw material and other operating costs through effective price manage- ment. And, we must continue protecting our solid cash flow through focused day-to-day manage- ment of manufacturing and purchasing produc- tivity, working capital and the improvement of any underperforming operations.
SUMMARY OF 2006 RESULTS
Net sales for the full year 2006 were $3.7 billion, up 3.6%, compared with $3.5 billion for 2005. Sales increased in all the Company’s reporting segments, led principally by higher selling prices

Net income for 2006 was $195.1 million ($1.92 per diluted share), up 21%, compared with $161.9 million ($1.61 per diluted share) for 2005.
Net income in 2006 was negatively impacted by after-tax restructuring charges of $21.3 million, all of which relate to previously announced cost reduction and restructuring activities. Net income for 2005 was negatively affected by $10.1 million of additional tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings, a $7.6 million after-tax expense to increase an environmental reserve and $13 million of after-tax restructuring costs.
Base earnings per diluted share for 2006 were $216 million ($2.13 per diluted share), up 12.1%, compared with $192.6 million ($1.92 per diluted share) for 2005. Base earnings is a non-GAAP

financial measure that excludes restructuring charges and certain non-recurring or infrequent and unusual expenses, as applicable. Additional information about base earnings, base earnings per share and base operating profit (pretax base earnings), along with reconciliations to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure, is provided on page 49 of this report.
The increase in base earnings for 2006 was primarily due to productivity improvements and maintaining a positive selling price/material cost relationship. These favorable factors were partially offset by increased costs for energy, freight and labor, along with an unfavorable shift in the mix of business.
In 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payments,” which requires the expensing of the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation.
As a result, net income and base earnings in 2006 include after-tax stock option charges of
$2.8 million ($.03 per diluted share). Prior to 2006, the Company expensed stock options based on their intrinsic value. Because the Company has only granted at-market options, which have an intrinsic value of zero, 2005 results did not include any corresponding stock option expense.
For the full year 2006, cash generated from operations was a record $482.6 million, more than doubling the $227.4 million in 2005. This increase resulted primarily from increased earnings, a decline in pension contributions and improved working capital. The cash generated from operations during 2006 was used to fund capital expenditures of $123.3 million and pay dividends of $94.8 million. The Company also repurchased 2.5 million shares of Sonoco common stock in

The execution of our strategy will focus on sales growth and margin improvement and, of course, the effective employment of the Company’s strong capital structure.
Our growth strategy is supported by a solid foundation of 108 years of packaging experience, including international

TOP-LINE GROWTH
Profitable top-line growth is the engine that must sustain Sonoco’s progress. Since 2000, excluding divested businesses, we have grown the top line at a 6.2% compound annual average rate, up from 4.6% for the prior five-year period. (This non-GAAP financial measure is reconciled to reported sales on page 49.) And, during the last three years, we have experienced consecutive annual increases in margins, signaling improved sales profitability. Nonetheless, we are not

During 2006, we spent $227.3 million on acqui- sitions that we expect to produce approximately $130 million of annual sales. These transactions included additional flexible packaging capacity, a need identified in last year’s annual report; addi- tional point-of-purchase assets, principally in the Chicago area; a producer of large-size rigid paper containers, giving us a new technology and access to an additional market; an increase in our rigid plastic capabilities; and the remaining 35.5% interest in the Sonoco-Alcore joint venture from Ahlstrom Corporation and the remaining 75% interest in the Italy-based Demolli joint venture. The last two trans- actions further solidified our leadership position in the tubes and cores market in Europe.
GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION
Geographic expansion remains an important growth tool for Sonoco, principally in response to our customers’ needs. In the past few years, we have opened tube and core facilities in China, a steel easy- opening closures facility in Brazil and a new service center for Procter & Gamble (P&G) in Poland.
In recent months, we started a new protective packaging line in Kaiping, China, for use by manufacturers of exercise equipment and kitchen appliances. We are now testing development of a similar production line in Turkey for a large European appliance maker. Also during 2006, we received a five-year contract to provide packaging fulfillment services for The LEGO Group in Poland near the existing Gillette service center where we package razors and blades.

Sonoco’s top-line growth will continue to be driven by focusing on strategic acquisitions and joint ventures; expanding geographically in response to customer requirements; strengthen- ing our organic sales growth funnel, including continued development of new products and ser- vices; and enhancing our position as the only true total solutions provider capable of meeting consumer product companies’ packaging supply chain needs. We must succeed in each of these areas to produce the necessary top-line growth that will sustain average annual double-digit total returns over the long term.

We are the only packaging company in the world that has adopted the strategy of being a truly full- service or total solutions provider for consumer product companies. We offer the broadest range of packaging supply chain products and services
in the industry in response to the desire of large consumer product companies to reduce their number of packaging suppliers.
A significant component of our total solutions offering is new product and market development. In 2000, we had no significant sales from new products. In 2006, we generated new product sales of about $111 million, the third consecutive year of growth. We define new products as those that have been commercial for two years or less. After two years, they are no longer counted as new product sales. Our goal over the next several years is to achieve annual sales of about $125 million from new products alone.
To further enhance our existing total solutions offerings, in 2006, we opened a new Innovation Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, dedicated exclusively to

products and services to meet its packaging supply chain needs. The
center is the first and only facility of its kind in the global packaging industry and has already resulted in several
new business activities between P&G and Sonoco.
REDUCE, RECLAIM AND RECYCLE
Our portfolio of packaging supply chain products and services runs from concept and design to reclamation and recycling. This newest addition is in response to increasing demands being placed on consumer product company customers by consumers and large retailers to reduce, reclaim and recycle packaging materials. Sonoco has long been one of the largest collectors and users of recovered paper, and as such, has an extensive infrastructure in place to handle this new requirement. We are using these resources as a base for identifying and developing opportunities to assist our consumer product company customers in meeting such demands. We do so by not only helping recover and recycle specific packaging waste
generated by our
customers’ products, but
also by helping retailers
dispose of other recyclable
waste materials. Through
this initiative, Sonoco
experts audit a
manufacturing facility to
review its existing
programs for handling wastes. The Company then develops programs that offer significant savings by reducing waste hauling charges and landfill fees, and converts the waste streams into revenue streams by facilitating recovery and recycling of

MANAGING THE FUNDAMENTALS
To help ensure profitable sales growth, we place strong emphasis on managing the
the plant’s remaining waste materials. The program is in the initial stages of development and during 2006, 12 Sonoco plants and two customers’ manufacturing facilities participated in
staying on top of such costs with timely price increases during 2005 and 2006, and we will remain diligent in offsetting future raw material cost increases.
Productivity improvement has become a way of life at Sonoco as an indispensable means of optimizing our cost structure and offsetting the impact of inflation. Since 2002, we have generated approximately $370 million in manufacturing and purchasing productivity savings, including a record in 2006. We will perpetuate productivity improve- ment through the ongoing execution of such process improvement disciplines as Six Sigma and Lean Manufacturing.
We have also continued making progress toward our previously stated goal of reversing the his- torical 55%/45% ratio of sales from our industrial and consumer markets, respectively. Today, we are near parity between the two and believe this improving balance has been a significant factor in helping Sonoco achieve a more consistent earnings record over the last few years. We expect that ratio to continue moving toward a portfolio more heavily weighted toward consumer markets which historically have been less sensitive to general economic cycles.
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
2006 was indeed a good year. Clearly, we had a strong performance in earnings, total shareholder return, generation of cash flow from operations, price/cost management, productivity improvement and margin enhancement. And, employee morale remains outstanding. However, we fell short of our aggressive, self-imposed expectations for top-line growth and for employee safety. While our safety record remains world class, we did not improve over the previous year. Fortunately, these issues are correctable with better execution, and positive

fundamentals, or “guts” of the business, to help drive and maintain margin expansion. With customer and market migration an ongoing significant global and domestic competitive factor, we must continuously identify and act on opportunities to reduce operating costs. This is particularly important because of Sonoco’s large complement of plants at 324 global locations. To that end, we completed two restructuring programs, one in 2001 and the other in 2003, totaling about $115 million in structural cost reductions. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the

 actions are already being implemented. More important than the past, however, are the actions required to ensure further improvement in 2007.
First, we must always ensure that we have the best people in the right jobs. This is seldom a static issue and requires constant monitoring.
We will focus on increasing sales by more aggressively strengthening our organic and new product sales funnels, continuing to seek strategic acquisitions that meet our criteria and by partner- ing with our customers geographically.
We will maintain a sharp “edge” about employee safety, which we consider a strong proxy for measuring our effectiveness in managing the fundamentals of our business. Any degree of complacency about employee safety is repugnant to our culture and shall not be tolerated.
We will work diligently to improve margins toward the 10% to 11% range through productivity improvements, price management, cost reductions and turning around any underperforming operations.
We will focus on building cash flow by targeting a working capital days reduction with a goal of
$50 million in savings in 2007, in addition to the $84 million improvement we made in 2006.
And, we will concentrate Companywide on improving return on assets and capital.
In conclusion, your management team has never felt more positive about Sonoco’s future. While comparisons to 2006 will clearly be difficult, we have more than ample opportunities to be highly successful. To that end, cash flow from operations in 2007 is again expected to be more than
