                    Dear Shareholders,
 2016 was another transformational year for our company. We achieved solid results across a number of dimensions, we strengthened both operationally and financially, and we head into 2017 with substantial momentum to continue delivering results for our shareholders, customers, communities, and employees.
Our company took several critical steps to put in place the building blocks that will drive deeper customer relationships, improve and diversify earnings
growth, and further position Ally as the leading digital
financial services company.
    We responded directly to what our customers were asking for b

accolades and posted record deposit growth of $12.5 billion in 2

 2016 as declines in lease revenue were offset by higher retail au

NOTE: The following are non-GAAP financial measures which Ally believes are important to the reader of
the Consolidated Financial Statements, but which are supplemental to and not a substitute for U.S. GAAP measures: core return on tangible common equity, adjusted earnings per share, and adjusted tangible book value per share. These measures are used by management and we believe are useful to investors in assessing the company’s operating performance and capital measures. Refer to the 2016 Financial Highlights later in this document for a Reconciliation to GAAP.

      2016 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
$2.16
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
$12.5 BILLION
TOTAL DEPOSIT GROWTH
10%
CORE ROTCE
                 Earnings growth in 2016 was impressive with Adjusted EPS up 8 percent from 2015. Full year Core ROTCE, which was only 3 percent in 2013, grew to 10 percent in 2016. We also returned more than $400 million of capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second half of 2016.
The robust deposit growth at Ally Bank
is a critical component of our improving profitability. In 2016, we increased total deposits by 19 percent to $79.0 billion, while reducing the cost of those deposits. This growth came from existing customers looking to increase their relationship with Ally, and from the more than 150,000 new customers we added during the year.
Operationally, we continued to navigate shifting auto industry dynamics and demonstrate the adaptability of our
auto business. As manufacturers direct more subvented loan and lease volume
to their captive lending arms, Ally’s full credit spectrum approach and breadth of products continues to resonate with dealers and customers in the marketplace. We
have successfully increased our retail loan portfolio by intensifying our focus on a broader spectrum of dealers and customers to offset a decline in the traditional subvented products. Optimizing shareholder capital is foundational for us, and we have
executed on our strategy to drive higher risk-adjusted returns over purely volume.
Our commercial auto business remains
a market leader, anchored by the experience of our national sales force, our rich history in the
auto industry, and an unmatched product offering and level of service. Commercial auto balances were robust in 2016, closing the year at $38.9 billion, up $4.0 billion year- over-year. Our unique relationships with our dealers, and our ability to understand their operations, are competitive advantages
and drivers of our leading position in this specialized market. Commercial auto
lending remains an attractive low-risk market for us with net losses in the portfolio at less than or equal to one basis point for five consecutive years.
Our Corporate Finance business, which has been primarily providing secured loans to middle-market companies for over 18 years, grew its portfolio 24 percent in 2016. This business leverages our expertise in serving middle market businesses and consistently delivers attractive risk-adjusted returns.
We see this as an attractive area for future growth and diversification.
We are proud of our financial accomplishments in 2016 and Ally’s
future opportunities are even brighter.
We can now approach our consumer and commercial banking customers with the most comprehensive set of products in our history. Our balance sheet will continue to benefit from strong deposit growth as we expect to refinance only a small amount of the nearly $12 billion of high cost unsecured debt maturities between 2017 and 2020, leading to significant interest expense efficiencies in the coming years. Moreover, generational shifts and powerful trends toward online and mobile banking act as external catalysts further supporting our growth path. Our well established and industry leading digital banking platform uniquely positions us to benefit from these secular trends.
Few competitors have an earnings trajectory like Ally. While markets remain optimistic about changes in the corporate tax regime, regulatory environment, or interest rate backdrop, we expect strong earnings growth that is not reliant on those external factors. Coupled with a relentless focus on delivering an exceptional customer experience, our franchise is well positioned for improved and sustainable financial performance with a long runway for growth.
EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT SUITE
The success of Ally Bank’s deposit franchise is driven by our alignment with desires of the modern banking consumer: transparency, simplicity, self-directed functionality delivered digitally, fair rates and fees, and high customer service expectations.
By executing on our value proposition,
we have created strong demand from customers who have enthusiastically asked to do more with us. This demand was first addressed in Spring 2016 with the acquisition of TradeKing, a unique cultural fit and an important component in our digital product evolution. TradeKing’s fee-based income business model, complementary customer base, and exceptional service, aligned favorably with Ally’s objectives. We remain excited about the opportunities of this business and look forward to its rebranding under the Ally umbrella in early 2017.
Our top requested product by deposit customers was an Ally credit card – so
we delivered. A natural extension of our product portfolio, the Ally CashBack credit card offers a competitive rewards program, highlighted by an industry leading 10% cash bonus for rewards deposited into an eligible Ally Bank account. As a co-branded credit card, this product allows us to address a customer need, diversify our revenue, and provide optionality to expand in the future.
In late 2016, we announced the launch of Ally Home, our direct-to-consumer home loan product. As the largest consumer asset class with a massive addressable market, mortgage is a cornerstone banking product and an attractive long term growth opportunity for us.
The addition of key products to our segment-leading deposit franchise, including Ally Home, Ally CashBack credit card and new investment services, join together to create a strong and competitive digital product portfolio that addresses
the needs of our customers and paves the way for deeper and broader customer relationships.
THE ALLY BRAND
In less than a decade, Ally has transformed from a captive auto finance company to a diversified digital financial services provider. As we have grown and continued to navigate new challenges and approach new opportunities, there has been one constant – a relentless commitment to do right by our customers. To reflect that commitment, we introduced the “Do It Right” campaign
               
  in 2016, a unified brand approach that encapsulates Ally’s culture, strategy, and brand promise.
As a relatively new player compared to other top 25 bank holding companies, Ally’s brand is a critical competitive differentiator. The significant investments we’ve made
in the brand, along with the expansion
of our product portfolio at Ally Bank, engaging activities such as the Lucky Penny initiative, and the receipt of numerous industry accolades, resulted in record brand awareness of 57 percent in 2016, up from 45 percent only two years ago. This serves as affirmation from our customers and reflects the tremendous progress we’ve made with a brand that was little more than a blank sheet of paper less than ten
years ago.
LEADING CULTURE
2016 highlighted the importance of integrity and accountability in financial services. While the “Do It Right” campaign was an effective branding initiative for Ally, its message is very much rooted in our culture and the collective accountability that permeates everything we do. This culture, the guiding principles of Ally, is reflected in what we call our LEAD core values:
L OOK EXTERNALLY
E XECUTE WITH EXCELLENCE A CT WITH PROFESSIONALISM D ELIVER RESULTS
Ally’s LEADing culture is of the utmost importance to me and the responsibility of every associate at Ally, every day. It is this culture that provides the roadmap for us to “Do It Right” for our customers and in our communities.
Community engagement is an important aspect of our culture. We have continued to invest in our communities and our associates volunteered more than 20,000 hours through our annual “Giving Back” month in November as well as throughout the year.
We have also elevated the importance of diversity and inclusion at Ally. I believe that by embracing, leveraging and celebrating our differences, we can better achieve our
strategic objectives and drive value for associates, communities and shareholders.
At Ally, our 7,600 dedicated associates work tirelessly to “Do It Right” for our customers, company and communities and I’m so proud to lead such a motivated team
every day.
FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE
The financial and operational progress we made last year has created a solid foundation for long-term growth in shareholder value. Financially, we are now free from high cost preferred dividends and have demonstrated substantial deposit growth that will expand margins as expensive unsecured debt matures in the coming years. Operationally, we can approach customers with a powerful
and diverse digital product suite while continuing to provide the best-in-class service that our customers expect.
The strength and consistent earnings power of the franchise has not yet been realized and I firmly believe the complexion of Ally today represents a unique and compelling
opportunity for shareholders. Our goal is to grow Adjusted EPS at a 15 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next three years while delivering approximately $5 billion of annual net financing revenue by 2019. We have the right ingredients to grow earnings, expand return on equity, grow book value per share, diversify operationally, strengthen the franchise and drive long term value for
our owners.
The secular trends towards online banking are significant and provide a tailwind that supports our strategic direction and financial path. The building blocks of a leading digital financial services company are squarely in place. As we approach our customers with
a clear sense of purpose and steadfast determination to “Do It Right”, I could not be more excited by the opportunities that lie ahead.
