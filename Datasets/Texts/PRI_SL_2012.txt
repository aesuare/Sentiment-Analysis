 Dear Stockholders,
In 2012, we executed a strategy to deliver shareholder value by implementing incentives and innovations designed to build distribution and drive long-term earnings growth, while actively managing our capital. This pivotal year demonstrated our ability to maintain financial momentum while reigniting growth in the size of the sales force.

2012 Distribution Accomplishments
In the first quarter we made signif- icant adjustments to our messaging and incentive programs for our
sales force by simplifying incentive qualifications and providing more incentives to train and license new representatives and to help them be- come productive. A new streamlined life insurance licensing process was launched mid-year, providing an ef- fective life insurance licensing system for new recruits to follow. We also refocused our licensing instructors on helping new representatives through the licensing process.

During the year, we modified our life insurance compensation system to place more emphasis on developing new leaders and building distribu- tion, and less emphasis on short-term premium hurdles. These initiatives drove a 30% increase in the ratio of new recruits obtaining a life license year-over-year, resulting in a larger life insurance licensed sales force at year-end.
Our 2012 Investment and Savings Products (ISP) sales were the highest they had been since 2007. The enhancements we made to our ISP business during the year positioned

us to capitalize on the changing tide
in investor confidence. In 2012, we continued the implementation of a new managed account product and ex- panded our product offerings with the addition of fixed indexed annuities. Our first year of fixed indexed annuity product sales topped $395 million, reflecting the popularity of the product with conservative clients interested in capital preservation.
Managed account client assets signifi- cantly increased to $582 million at the end of 2012 from $154 million at the end of 2011. As we move into 2013, we will continue to build on this new product success as well as expand our annuity product offerings, including
a new private label fixed indexed annu-
ity product underwritten by Lincoln Financial.
2012 cApitAl Accomplishments
During the year, we successfully executed a $375 million inaugural debt offering, raising our corporate debt by $75 million with only a slight increase in interest expense and leaving our debt-to-capital ratio relatively
low at 22.7% at the end of 2012. We also completed a redundant reserve financing transaction in the first half of the year. With the capital made available from this transaction, we repurchased 5.7 million shares. For the full year, we repurchased a total of 9.5 million shares for $257.3 million, retiring 15% of Primerica’s outstand-
ing common stock in 2012. Since our IPO in April of 2010, we have retired approximately 25% of our common stock outstanding.
In 2013, we will work to enhance shareholder value by pursuing opportunities for future business growth and executing capital redeployment facilitated by an ordinary dividend from Primerica
Life Insurance Company. Our life company’s statutory Risk Based Capital (RBC) ratio was approximately 600% at the end of 2012, positioning us well to fund future business. Extracting an ordinary dividend from the life company in 2013 will help us move toward our longer-term RBC objective of 300-350%.
