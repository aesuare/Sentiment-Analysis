 TO OUR
FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS,
IT WAS A CHALLENGING YEAR FOR C.H. ROBINSON. WHILE WE ACCOMPLISHED MANY OF OUR GOALS, WE FAILED TO GROW EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR 16 YEARS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY. WE ARE AS MOTIVATED AS EVER TO RETURN TO THE GROWTH OUTCOMES OUR SHAREHOLDERS EXPECT, AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO OUR SHORT AND LONG TERM INITIATIVES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH.
THOUGH WE DID NOT ACHIEVE OUR PLANNED BOTTOM LINE RESULTS, OUR TOTAL REVENUES OF $12.8 BILLION REACHED A NEW HIGH, DRIVEN BY RECORD VOLUME IN THE TRUCKLOAD, LESS THAN TRUCKLOAD, OCEAN, AND AIR SERVICES. THE ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER COUNT GREW TO 46,000, AND WE NOW HAVE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH APPROXIMATELY 63,000 TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES AND OVER 2,000 FRESH PRODUCE GROWERS. WE ALSO RETURNED OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, INCLUDING AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE OF $500 MILLION.

 LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
(CONTINUED)
In addition to our record total revenue and volume results, we achieved significant strategic and operational milestones in 2013. We successfully integrated the operations of Phoenix International Freight Services, Ltd. (Phoenix) and Apreo Logistics; invested in our European network with new office openings in Istanbul, Basel, and Innsbruck; and we aligned our sales, account, and carrier management organizations in the North America Surface
Transportation network.
We expect the transportation industry will continue
to be challenging in 2014 as supply chains evolve
and the use of traditional long haul, dry van truckload shipments face more economic pressures. Regulatory factors—hours of service, compliance safety accountability, electronic on board recorders, and more—are increasing costs for all capacity providers. Competition remains fierce and formidable. All this drives the need to set ourselves apart through our strong network, technology, and service portfolio.
At our Investor Day in November, we detailed our long term growth plans, including our top priority of growing revenues and profitability. To create compelling differentiation in the market, we will leverage our competitive advantages, delivering great outcomes
to our clients, with the right services to the right customers at the right time.
We will continue to invest in our global services and network, with a focus on systems integration, cross selling, and network optimization of the Phoenix International business. In Europe, our expanded footprint will help us grow Global Forwarding and Surface Transportation revenues.
Our technology investments will further expand the capabilities of Navisphere®, our global technology platform, to enable employees, customers, and carriers to operate increasingly complex and integrated
supply chains. Global visibility, strategic analytics, and customized solutions remain critical to all of our stakeholders.
Our employees, so critical to our successes and so central to all we aspire to do, diligently deliver exceptional value to customers and shareholders.
Their efforts—combined with twelve years on the Best Place to Work list for large companies in the State of Minnesota and being named #1 on the list in 2013— attract the industry’s best talent. All this encourages job candidates to investigate the compelling career opportunities and professional development we offer.
While 2013 was challenging, we remained committed
to investing in our business for the long term benefit
of customers, suppliers, employees, and shareholders. Our strategy—to grow market share, add new services, and expand and optimize our network—remain relevant and appropriate across our global business. We are confident that the talent and passion of over 11,000 employees will drive continued growth for many years to come. We have a strong history of adapting and evolving over the last 100-plus years, and with a flexible, variable cost business model and great culture, we will build an even stronger organization for our future. Thank you for believing in us and trusting our commitment to the long term priorities of our business.
Thank you,
John P. Wiehoff
Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board
