                                           The U.S. economy continued its recovery in 2004, and business conditions for containerboard and corrugated products improved considerably. Industry corrugated products volume was up a healthy 3.2% over 2003. This was the first significant increase in demand since 1999, following two years of essentially flat growth for the industry. Containerboard inventories declined steadily through June, hitting a 10-year low at only 3.8 weeks of supply. Two industry-wide price increases for both containerboard and corrugated products were implemented, with most of the price realization occurring in the second half of the year.
PCA capitalized on these improving business conditions and, once again, our volume growth in corrugated products exceeded the industry by a wide margin. For the full year, adjusted net income (defined below) increased 20% over 2003 to $0.48 per share. Our earnings were up substantially in the second half of the year, with adjusted net income of $0.43 per share versus $0.05 in the first half. PCAÕs stock price increased from $21.86 to $23.55 per share during the year. Including our $0.60 per share dividend, PCAÕs total return in 2004 was 10.5% and, since the IPO
in January 2000, our total return is just over 100%.
Net income for 2004 was $69 million, or $0.64 per share, compared to a loss of $14 million, or $0.14 per share, in 2003. Net income for 2004 includes income of $17 million, or $0.16 per share, from a dividend paid to PCA by Southern Timber Venture, a timberlands joint venture in which PCA holds a 311Ú3% ownership interest.

net income includes a one-time charge of $10 million, or $0.09 per share, to settle certain benefits-related matters with Pactiv Corporation, and charges totaling $47 million, or $0.44 per share, related to PCAÕs July 2003 debt refinancing. Excluding these special items, adjusted net income for 2004 was $52 million, or $0.48 per share, compared to $42 million, or $0.40 per share, in 2003. Full year sales were $1.9 billion compared to $1.7 billion in 2003.
Cash generated from operating activities remained strong in 2004, with $215 million in cash generated. Of this amount, $109 million was used for capital expenditures, and $38 million was used to fund the acquisition of Acorn Packaging. Cash-on-hand at year-end was $213 million, up $41 million from 2003, and long-term debt at year-end was $695 million.
Reflecting back on 2004, we are pleased with the significant progress and accomplishments that were made in some key areas. First and foremost, our growth in corrugated products volume exceeded the industry for the seventh consecutive year. PCA volume was up 7% in 2004 compared to industry growth of 3.2%. Since 1997, PCAÕs corrugated products volume is up 26% compared to 1% for the industry.

We believe that this performance validates our simple and straightforward business model, which is based on providing the best value to our customers while at the same time being easy to do business with.

                                          We are also pleased with the acquisition of Acorn Packaging in February 2004, which added signifi- cantly to our value-added graphics capabilities. This acquisition has produced very good returns, was immediately accretive to earnings and increased PCAÕs integration level by over 1%.
With improving business conditions, we were able to implement two price increases in both containerboard and corrugated products during the year. Our box plants did an outstanding job in servicing our customers in the face of strong demand and low containerboard inventories. The inventory situation was further exacerbated as transit times for rail shipments continued to increase. While low container- board inventories did increase our operating costs, they did not significantly impact our ability to service our customers. Our containerboard mills ran extremely well, with production up 3.8% over 2003, which enabled us to support our strong corrugated products growth. This performance was possible, in part, because of projects we completed at our Counce and Valdosta linerboard mills that allowed us to run more efficiently on lighter weight grades.
Also noteworthy was the ÒbiogasÓ project at our Tomahawk medium mill. This project involved constructing a plastic enclosure over our wastewater treatment lagoon and capturing the methane gas that is generated as organic materials decompose during treatment. This methane gas is then burned as fuel in our boilers, replacing almost all of the costly natural gas that had previously been used. This project generated a return of over 50%, and was recognized as the largest industrial project in the state of Wisconsin for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
We are also pleased with the returns on our investment in Southern Timber Venture (STV), in which we have
a 311Ú3% equity interest. STV also continues to be a capable and reliable pulp wood supplier to PCA. STV now owns about 150,000 acres of timberlands and manages about 320,000 acres of land in which PCA has pulpwood supply agreements.
Our credit ratios, commonly used by the ratings agencies, continue to improve and are among the best in the industry. PCAÕs exposure to increased interest expense from interest rate increases is minimal, since about 80% of our debt has a fixed interest rate averaging 4.9%. The remaining term of our fixed rate debt is, on average, approximately seven years.
By the end of the year, we reached a position where we felt that it was the right time to increase our dividend. On January 19, 2005, PCA announced an increase in its quarterly dividend to an annual rate of $1.00 per share effective with payments beginning April 15, 2005. This dividend increase of 67%
came one year after PCA paid its first common stock dividend. At PCAÕs end of the year closing price
of $23.55 per share, this dividend reflected a yield of 4.25%, which is the highest in the industry and supports our commitment to create and return
value to our shareholders.
The business fundamentals for containerboard and corrugated products remain favorable as we enter 2005. The economy is expected to remain healthy and the unemployment rate has continued to fall. The U.S. dollar has weakened probably more than most people expected, and a weak dollar has historically been good for our industry. Containerboard inventories have remained at reasonable levels, especially in
light of current transportation difficulties, and the American Forest & Paper Association reported that industry capacity remained flat in 2004 after three consecutive years of decline. Increasing costs for wood, recycled fiber, energy and transportation remain an industry wide concern, which must be offset eventually by better pricing to improve profitability.
Our strategy will continue to revolve around the concept of operational excellence. We are specialists in containerboard and corrugated products, with 97% of our sales in that segment compared to much lower percentages for our major competitors. Our success depends on continuing to improve our capabilities and expertise in every operational aspect of our business. We plan to continue to grow our corrugated products volume and increase our integration level through internal growth as well as by the strategic acquisition of box plants. Finally, we will continue our efforts to capitalize on our strategic and financial flexibility to create and return value to our shareholders.
