To Our Shareholders
   We are proud to report another record year for Reliance with our highest ever revenues and profits. In 2008 we grew the Company substantially, we had record cash flow from operations and we paid down a substantial amount of debt. Reliance is now the largest metals service center company in North America with more
than 200 locations in 38 states and seven foreign countries. We completed three acquisitions during 2008, including our largest to-date, based on transaction value. Our 2008 acquisitions along with our internal growth initiatives were important in further expanding and diversifying our product, customer and geographic base, both domestically and internationally.

speed of the changes that occurred in the 2008 fourth quarter. Starting primarily
in November and December, we experienced sudden declines in demand and accelerated mill pricing reductions that resulted in significant competitive pressures and deteriorating profit margins. We reacted quickly to the changing business conditions by aggressively reducing our working capital and our operating costs. This allowed us to remain profitable during the challenging 2008 fourth quarter.
Business conditions have not improved yet in 2009 and we$8a,7re18.u8ncertain as to when demand or pricing will have any meaningful improvements. However, we continue to
