SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO.
 2012 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS
To our Shareholders:
The year 2012 represented our 40th consecutive year of profitability—a remarkable feat unmatched in the U.S. aviation industry. Our profits were boosted by an outstanding record revenue performance. Our critical strategic initiatives contributed significantly to the 52 percent surge in cash flow from operations in 2012. In 2012, we added Southwest Airlines service to two new states, Georgia and Iowa, and six new airports: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, Akron-Canton Regional, Dayton International, Des Moines International, Key West International, and Ronald Reagan Washington National. Our 2012 operational performance was superb, with Southwest achieving 83.1 percent ontime for the year and recording the best baggage handling in our history.
Our 2012 net income was $421 million, or $.56 per diluted share, including special items (primarily noncash, mark-to-market, and other items required for a portion of the Company’s fuel hedge portfolio, as well as costs associated with the acquisition and integration of AirTran). Excluding special items, our 2012 profits increased 26 percent year-over-year to $417 million, or $.56 per diluted share.
We remain focused on preserving our financial strength and enhancing Shareholder value. In May 2012, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in our previous share repurchase authorization to $1 billion, and a 122 percent increase in our quarterly dividend. These actions, coupled with the generation of a healthy
$716 million in free cash flow1 during 2012, enabled us to return $422 million to Shareholders through stock repurchases ($400 million) and dividends ($22 million). In 2012, we repurchased approximately 46 million shares of common stock at an average price per share of $8.78, which compares favorably to yesterday’s closing price of $12.64. In addition, yesterday’s stock price represents an increase of over
50 percent from a year ago. We repaid $578 million in debt and capital lease obligations during 2012. As a result, our debt-to-total capital ratio (including aircraft leases) declined to approximately 41 percent at yearend. As of December 31, 2012, our cash and short-term investments were a strong $3 billion, with a fully-available $800 million bank line-of-credit. We remain the only investment grade-rated U.S. airline.
1 Free cash flow is calculated as operating cash flows of $2.064 billion less capital expenditures of $1.348 billion. Additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures is included in the accompanying Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.
 
We are in the midst of a bold, five-year strategic plan that began in 2011. The plan is designed to retain our position as America’s most flown and most popular airline, and regain adequate returns on invested capital in today’s high fuel price environment. We believe in our strategic plan, and I am pleased to report on the tremendous progress made in 2012 on our critical strategic initiatives:
AirTran integration: We are on track with our plan to fully integrate AirTran into Southwest Airlines by the end of 2014 and achieve $400 million in net, annualized, pre-tax synergies in 2013 (excluding acquisition and integration expenses). The first group of AirTran Employees officially joined the Southwest family in January 2012, and all Southwest and AirTran union workgroup seniority integration methodologies were resolved as of last year. We received a single operating certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in March 2012, just ten months after the close of the acquisition. We converted 11 AirTran 737-700 aircraft to the Southwest livery with our Evolve interior. We introduced Southwest service to existing AirTran operations in Atlanta, Akron-Canton, and Dayton, and we fully converted AirTran stations at Seattle, Washington Dulles, Des Moines, and Key West to Southwest operations. While AirTran discontinued service to 14 cities that proved unsustainable with high fuel prices, we launched AirTran service to Austin, Orange County, Mexico City, and Cabo San Lucas. As of April 2013, the 97 cities collectively served in the Southwest and AirTran networks will be fully connected, which we expect will provide incremental revenues and significant opportunities to optimize the combined network. We realized $142 million of net, annualized, pre-tax synergies during 2012 (excluding acquisition and integration expenses).
All-New Rapid Rewards frequent flyer program: The first full calendar year of our revamped Rapid Rewards® program exceeded our expectations, with record activity from existing Members and record numbers of new Members and credit card applications. The new program provided $180 million in incremental revenues in 2012, as compared to 2011.
Fleet modernization: In March 2012, we began retrofitting 737-700 aircraft with our new Evolve interior, which provides new Customer comfort features along with increased seating capacity from 137 to 143 seats. We expect to have all 372 of Southwest’s -700s retrofitted with Evolve by June 2013 and 78 of our 737-300 aircraft retrofitted by the end of 2013. We signed an agreement in 2012 to transition all 88 of AirTran’s 717-200 aircraft to Delta Air Lines, Inc., beginning August 2013. All Southwest 737-700 and 737-800 aircraft are now equipped with Row 44 technology enabling access to satellite-based WiFi, our recently upgraded television offering, and movies on demand. Our fleet modernization plan also includes our December 2011 order for 150 Boeing 737 MAX airplanes, with the first delivery expected in 2017. The 737 MAX is expected to have the lowest operating cost in the single-aisle segment, reducing fuel burn and CO2 emissions by an additional 10 to 11 percent compared to today’s most fuel-efficient single-aisle airplane.

Boeing 737-800s: In our efforts to modernize our fleet, we began 737-800 flying in March 2012 and ended the year with 34 -800s in our fleet. We are very excited about the benefits this new aircraft type brings to Southwest with more than 20 percent additional seat capacity per aircraft than on a 737-700. We can operate the -800 at a lower unit cost than the -700, which lends itself well to longhaul and capacity- constrained, high-demand markets, as well as potential new longhaul markets like Hawaii, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean.
New reservation system and international capabilities: We intend to replace our existing reservation system with a comprehensive system that would provide the ability for Southwest to serve international destinations and allow for other Customer Service, revenue management, and schedule production capabilities. In 2012, we selected Amadeus to implement the reservation solution to support international service on Southwest in 2014. We plan to complete the full deployment of a new reservation system beyond 2014. We received FAA approval to conduct operations, under certain circumstances, outside the continental United States and announced service to San Juan, Puerto Rico, beginning in April 2013. We also received Houston City Council approval to design and build a five-gate international terminal with a U.S. customs facility at Houston’s William P. Hobby Airport.
In December 2012, we announced new 2013 revenue streams, including the first phase of a new origin and destination revenue management system, more aggressive network optimization, and new ancillary offerings. These offerings include increases in existing service charges, selling open A1 through A15 premium boarding positions at the gate, and a new policy associated with restricted tickets that are not canceled
(or changed) prior to departure.
Collectively, we expect our strategic initiatives and new revenue streams to contribute the majority of the planned $1.1 billion year-over-year revenue increase in 2013. In addition, we intend to aggressively manage our invested capital base. While the fleet modernization plans provide significant growth potential, we do not plan to grow the fleet until earnings are expected to generate sufficient returns on capital. All told, our 2013 goal remains a 15 percent pre-tax return on invested capital.
Southwest Airlines is the nation’s largest airline in terms of domestic passengers boarded2, and, including AirTran, we operate the largest fleet of Boeing aircraft in the world. Thanks to our Employees who deliver world-class Customer Service every day, we once again led the domestic airline industry in Customer Satisfaction in 20123. Southwest has ranked on FORTUNE magazine’s Most Admired list every year since 1994, and we were thrilled to uphold that record with our recent recognition as the Seventh Most Admired Company in the World! We were the highest ranking airline and the only commercial airline to make the Top Ten.
2 As measured by the number of originating domestic passengers boarded and based on data available from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), as of Sept. 30, 2012.
3 From the 2012 yearend DOT Air Travel Consumer Report issued February 2013. Top ranking is for Southwest Airlines only.
 
As we look to our future, our priority is to maintain the excellence we have built over the past four decades with our Brand, Culture, Customer Service, Operational Excellence, and consecutive annual profits. We remain one of the lowest cost producers among major airlines, and, unlike many of our competitors, we have maintained a strong Balance Sheet while returning significant value to our Shareholders.
I am incredibly proud of our past four decades and, in particular, all our accomplishments in 2012. I am enthusiastic about our 2013 plan and believe our transformation efforts will make us better, stronger, and more competitive. And, the outstanding efforts, commitment, and dedication of our People give me confidence in our ability to successfully execute our plan. We are committed to our Purpose – to connect people to what’s important in their lives with safe, friendly, reliable, low cost air travel. It is that Purpose that will guide us forward on our journey in pursuit of our Vision to become the World’s Most Loved, Most Flown, and Most Profitable Airline.
