 Dear Fellow Stockholders,
As Primerica’s new CEO, I am excited to be writing to you in my first annual report to stockholders. Primerica completed 2014 and began 2015 with very positive momentum. We look forward to building on that momentum to further expand distribution, increase earnings and deploy capital to drive long-term stockholder value.
2014 was a year of growth for Primerica across all metrics.
• Growth in the size of our life insurance licensed sales force
• Growth in Term Life insurance policies issued
• Growth in Investment and Savings Products sales
• Growth in net operating income
• Growth in net operating earnings per diluted share
• Growth in net operating income return on adjusted
stockholders’ equity
Our experienced sales force leaders and home office team worked diligently throughout the year to deliver these strong results. Achievements were powered
by strategic initiatives to drive long-term sales and earnings growth while actively deploying capital to enhance stockholder returns. Our unique business model, which combines extensive distribution capabilities that generate diverse earnings and strong capital deployment, enabled us to continue
to deliver value for our stakeholders.

Distribution Highlights
One of our ongoing objectives is
to enhance earnings through organic growth. Primerica’s life insurance licensed sales force drives this
growth and increased 3% to 98,358 representatives, and our mutual fund licensed sales force grew 4% to 22,607 representatives from the end of 2013. During the year we maintained our targeted ratio of new recruits obtaining a life insurance license and saw a
slight improvement in the ratio of life licensed representatives renewing their licenses compared with 2013. We made enhancements to product offerings and sales processes for our clients as well as expanded the business opportunity for our representatives. Successful incentive programs drove higher recruiting levels and an increase in life insurance policies issued in 2014 versus the prior year.
During 2014, industry-leading technology was deployed to advance our business. We launched new mobile sales
tools and web-based representative training as well as expanded the functionality of our online client service platform as part of a continuous effort to help our representatives be more efficient and productive. Our focus on electronic processing has paid off with nearly 90% of life insurance applications and over 75% of U.S. mutual fund applications on our processing platform now submitted electronically.
Business enhancements drove growth in the Term Life Insurance segment including a 4% increase in annualized issued term life insurance premiums compared with 2013. Our Term Life business outperformed the life insurance industry in 2014 as our life insurance policies issued increased 3%, while the MIB Life Index reported the industry’s life application activity declined 1% from 2013.
Our Investment and Savings Products (ISP) segment set all-time
records in both sales and client asset values in 2014, reflecting solid execution of our strategy to grow this fee based business, which is less capital intensive. During 2014, we expanded product offerings with the addition of four new managed account portfolios, two new variable annuities providers and a new fixed indexed annuity, all underwritten by third parties. We also implemented more robust illustration software to make complex topics easier for our representatives to discuss and for
our clients to act upon. These efforts resulted in a higher average initial investment in retail mutual funds and variable annuities which increased 7% and 16%, respectively, compared to 2013. ISP sales grew 9% to $5.68 billion, generating positive net flows of $0.86 billion, year-over-year. Positive market performance resulted in an 8% increase in ending client asset values to $48.66 billion from the end of last year.
  Primerica representatives all over North America help Main Street families create a better financial future while building a business for themselves.

   Primerica has successfully executed our strategy to enhance earnings through organic growth.

Performance
Primerica’s capacity to generate and deploy capital to enhance stockholder value was well demonstrated in 2014. Results were marked by solid core performance across business segments. Term Life Insurance net premiums increased 11% and Investment and Saving Products operating revenues were up 12%, driving 9% growth in
net operating income to $182.8 million compared with 2013. A key component of our earnings is the revenue generated by our ISP segment, which accounted for 38% of total operating revenues
in 2014. Primerica’s recurring life insurance revenues and positive ISP performance coupled with active capital deployment resulted in a 14% increase in net operating earnings per diluted share year-over-year. Net operating income return on adjusted stockholders’ equity (ROAE) increased 60 basis points to 15.3% compared with 2013. ROAE is expected to remain strong
in the 16% range on an annualized basis, significantly outpacing returns of traditional life insurance companies.
Primerica has a very strong balance
sheet and conservative portfolio composed of high quality invested assets. Our reliance on investment returns is relatively low with a ratio of invested assets and cash to stockholders’ equity at 1.9x and net investment
income representing only 6% of our operating revenues in 2014. Primerica Life Insurance Company remains well positioned for future growth with a Risk Based Capital (RBC) statutory ratio of approximately 400% at year end.
In 2014, we returned over 95%
of operating earnings to stockholders through $26.5 million of stockholder dividends and $147.9 million of common stock repurchases, retiring 5.5% of Primerica’s common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2013. In each full year since our IPO, we have consistently returned 95% or more of operating earnings to stockholders. During 2014 we completed a redundant reserve financing transaction which should enable the execution of our multi-year capital strategy. In 2015, we plan to repurchase approximately $150 million of Primerica’s common stock, and in
the first quarter of 2015 we raised our quarterly stockholder dividend by 33% to $0.16 per share.
Investors have responded
favorably to the actions we’ve taken
to enhance stockholder value through organic growth and active capital deployment. The total stockholder return of Primerica’s common stock
was 28% in 2014, which significantly outpaced the S&P 500. We have made tremendous progress in executing our strategy since becoming an independent public company in 2010, and it has
been reflected in our strong stock performance. As of year-end 2014, the total return for Primerica common stock since our IPO was 275%.

 Primerica’s capacity to generate and deploy capital has enhanced stockholder value.

 Looking Ahead
As we move forward, our capital strength and flexibility position us well to improve returns on capital. We will continue execution of the strategy
set in motion by our former Co-CEOs, Rick Williams and John Addison. We are grateful for their leadership over the past 15 years and look forward to building on their legacy of supporting and growing our sales force to drive performance and deliver positive financial results.
We see a lot of opportunity ahead. Traditional financial services companies have long focused on the more affluent segment of the market. However, 50% of U.S. households
fall in the middle-income market. We
Sincerely,
Glenn Williams
Chief Executive Officer
believe our educational approach
and unparalleled distribution model allow us to meet the financial needs
of these families better than any other company. The number of individual life policies sold in the U.S. on an annual basis has dropped significantly over the past 30 years even though the number of households with children has continued to rise. Families not only need more life insurance, but approximately half of Americans are not saving for retirement according
to industry sources. With the largest exclusive life insurance licensed sales force in North America at 98,400
and more than 22,600 mutual fund licensed representatives, Primerica
is uniquely positioned to fill these financial gaps for Main Street families.
We strongly believe in the long- term growth prospects of Primerica and are inspired every day by the attitudes and commitment of our sales force and employees. Our long- standing management team – who average 28 years with the company
– is working diligently to improve all areas of our business. From product improvements and technology innovations to capital efficiency, we continue to build Primerica for the future and are truly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
