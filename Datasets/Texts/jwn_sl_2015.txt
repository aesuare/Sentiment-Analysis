DEAR CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS
At Nordstrom, our number one goal is to improve customer service. This approach has always guided our strategy and served our stakeholders well. 2015 was no exception though we faced a challenging retail environment in the second half of the year. We ended 2015 with record sales of $14.1 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the prior year. We also increased our market share, with net sales growth of 7.5 percent and a comparable sales increase of 2.7 percent. For the first half of the year, we achieved results that exceeded our expectations. In the second half, we experienced a noticeable shift in consumer spending that has continued into the early months of 2016. With our team's many years of experience successfully managing through challenging cycles, we worked to adjust our sales expectations, inventories and expenses as quickly as possible to reflect these trends. Even with these adjustments, higher markdowns taken as a result of lower-than-planned sales, combined with an elevated promotional environment during the holiday season, caused our earnings results to be below our expectations. We continue to monitor trends and make appropriate adjustments to ensure that we remain competitive, have the best product available for our customers and improve our overall results.

CUSTOMER STRATEGY We've made many strategic decisions over the years to evolve our business as our customers' preferences have evolved. Nordstrom was among the first retailers to invest in ecommerce, new technologies and organizational alignment to support a seamless customer experience. While retail and customer expectations are changing at an even faster pace today than just a few years ago, we believe our attention to the customer keeps us focused on long-term success.

Our customers desire a relevant experience no matter how they choose to shop--full-price, off-price, in stores or online. Each represents an opportunity for us to connect with customers on their terms, which means an experience that is increasingly relevant, convenient and personalized. Our goal is to build a seamless `One Nordstrom' customer experience. We know the value of our strategy, in addition to driving sales, new customer acquisition and increased market share, is that customers who shop Nordstrom across multiple channels spend more than that

BIG SUCCESS IN B.C.: THE OPENING OF OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL FLAGSHIP STORE IN VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, MARKED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN OUR HISTORY. LOCATED IN THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN VANCOUVER, THIS NEW STORE IS AN EXCITING STEP FORWARD IN ENRICHING OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, AND WILL PROVIDE GREAT LEARNINGS AS WE OPEN FLAGSHIP STORES IN TORONTO IN 2016 AND MANHATTAN IN 2019.

of a single-channel customer. The total number of customers we serve, the number of new-to-Nordstrom customers and customer engagement (those who shop more than one channel) are all up. One highlight of this is that 5 million new customers shopped Nordstrom Rack in 2015--an important channel for us for acquisition and increased cross-shopping. We've made significant investments that enable customers to shop seamlessly across stores and online, as well as grow our business through new markets like Canada and expanded ecommerce capabilities--all of which have helped increase sales and market share. Our online business now represents more than 20 percent of our total net sales, a notable increase from eight percent just five years ago. With over $3 billion in capital invested over the last five years, we grew net sales by 50 percent, or nearly $5 billion during this time. We've always considered 2015 to be a peak investment year and that hasn't changed. What has changed is the current environment, which requires us to adapt even more as we remain focused on improving profitability. FULL-PRICE: NORDSTROM AND NORDSTROM.COM As a full-price retailer, the constant pursuit of newness and fashion to increase relevance with customers is at the core of our business. We've also invested to enable a seamless customer experience across stores and online. When we execute well, we're able to differentiate ourselves and offer customers a consistently great shopping experience on their terms. We're

continuously improving the experience we offer customers in our full-line stores with improved services such as Buy Online & Pick Up in Store, which we launched in 2008, and more recently, curbside delivery. Comparable sales of our full-price business--Nordstrom U.S. full-line stores and Nordstrom.com--increased 2.3 percent in 2015, and net sales for our full-price business, inclusive of Canada and Trunk Club, increased 5.1 percent. We opened five new fullline stores last year including our first international flagship store in Vancouver, British Columbia, which was the most successful opening in Nordstrom history. This store represents a major step forward and will help influence the level of service we envision as we execute our plans to expand our flagship presence to Toronto in 2016 and Manhattan in 2019. We continue to believe Canada represents a $1 billion opportunity and we're pleased with our results to date. We also opened stores in Ottawa, Ontario; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Milwaukee; a second full-line store in Minneapolis; and relocated one store in Los Angeles. Each new store reflects our latest store design, which is now featured in 10 locations, including significant remodels of our flagship stores in Seattle and on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. In 2016, we plan to open two full-line stores in Toronto, including our second flagship store in Canada, our second store in Austin, and we relocated our store in Honolulu, which opened on March 11, 2016. We believe that by 2020, one-third of our customer experiences will end with a package at their front door. As a result, when

shopping online, how and when that package arrives helps shape how that customer views great service. To support the growth of Nordstrom.com in 2015 we opened a new fulfillment center in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania that, combined with our existing facilities in Cedar Rapids and San Bernardino, greatly improves our ability to meet and exceed our customers' rising expectations. Customers want to do business with retailers that are in step with how they choose to shop and mobile is an increasingly important link between the store and online experience. This year we made several improvements to our mobile app that enhance the customer experience, such as linking a customer's Nordstrom Rewards account to their Nordstrom app and a `shop my store' feature that allows customers to filter inventory that is specific to the store they're shopping. Each improvement is designed to offer the customer more control of their own experience. As a result, we've seen strong growth in mobile sales, which now represents over one-third of online demand, up from less than five percent just five years ago. TRUNK CLUB In 2014 we acquired Trunk Club, a high-growth personalized clothing service that complements our own approach to customer service. In fall 2015 we collaborated to expand this concept with the launch of Trunk Club for women. Trunk Club is a great example of combining the online and offline worlds to deliver a personalized, differentiated shopping experience.

OFF-PRICE: NORDSTROM RACK, NORDSTROMRACK.COM AND HAUTELOOK Nordstrom Rack is a wonderful source of new customers for the company. It's provided access to new markets and a pipeline of new customers since the inception of our Rack business over 40 years ago. Nordstrom Rack, Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook comparable sales increased 4.3 percent and total net sales increased 14 percent in 2015, which was 29 percent of net company sales. Serving our customers in the ways they want to shop has driven the growth in our off-price online business. Last year we launched Nordstromrack.com and combined it with HauteLook so customers are able to shop both on a shared website. Those businesses together grew approximately 50 percent in 2015, generating a half-billion dollars in sales and surpassing our expectations. It took 15 years for Nordstrom.com to reach $1 billion in sales. We believe Nordstromrack.com and HauteLook combined have the potential to reach that milestone in half the time. Rack stores continue to be highly productive with solid returns for our investment. We opened 27 Rack stores in 2015, and we expect to open 21 stores and relocate two in 2016. INCREASING RELEVANCE More than any one thing, new and relevant merchandise and brands drive our business, keep customers coming back to Nordstrom and help attract new customers. Growing brands such as Topshop/ Topman, Madewell, Brandy Melville and Charlotte Tilbury are playing an important role in attracting new customers. This year

we also launched SPACE, a shop for emerging and advanced designers created and curated by Nordstrom Vice President of Creative Projects Olivia Kim, in five stores as well as online. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP In 2015 we completed the sale of our credit card receivables to TD Bank. Our number one goal was to ensure we continue to have a one-to-one relationship with our valued cardholders, with Nordstrom retaining all aspects of customer-facing activities. We were also pleased to be able to return capital directly to our shareholders in the form of a special dividend and through continued share repurchase. We're pleased with the outcome for shareholders and our partnership with TD. We found TD to be a strong cultural fit, sharing our customer-focused approach and providing capabilities to help us further enhance the customer experience. CONCLUSION The customer is in control now more than ever with access to increasingly more information and choices. The rapidly changing landscape challenges us to build on our culture of service in new and exciting ways that adapt to our customers' expectations. Our customer-focused strategy is an important point of differentiation that guides every decision to better serve customers on their terms. We're proud of the collective efforts of our team and we thank them, and you, our shareholders, for your continued support of Nordstrom.

Finally, we would be remiss if we didn't single out the strong leadership we have had from Rick Hernandez, our retiring Chairman of the Board of Directors. Rick joined our board in 1997, became Lead Director in 2000 and Chairman in 2006. His many contributions include helping us strengthen the governance of our company, partnering to create a world-class group of directors and providing a steady hand and expertise to our executive team on many matters including strategic direction, leadership development and succession planning as we have developed a position of leadership in the retail industry. We are grateful for his partnership. Rick will remain on the board and we're delighted to welcome in Phil Satre, another terrific board member, as Chairman beginning in May.

A NOTE FROM OUR CHAIRMAN
In 2015 Nordstrom gained market share despite the difficult retail environment that confronted all retailers during the second half of the year. The company accomplished this through continued focus on serving customers how, when and where they prefer to shop. Your Board of Directors and management remained committed to strong financial discipline and continued our efforts to achieve increased efficiency and productivity in all aspects of the business. Further, your Board and management honored our commitment to operate the business with the highest standards, principles, policies and people that are deserving of your trust and investment. Your Board acknowledges the rapid pace of change in retail today and firmly believes that focusing on the customer is the right strategy. As the Board looks back on 2015 and ahead to the future, we strongly support the executive management team led by Blake, Pete and Erik Nordstrom. Given their collective experience, knowledge of our industry and the management team they have assembled, the Board of Directors believes Nordstrom is evolving in-step with its customers to serve them better and positioning the company for long-term success. We have a dedicated, independent Board that is deeply committed to the highest standards of corporate governance. Nordstrom shareholders are benefited by an exceptional group of directors who are engaged with management and support the long-term goals the Board has set. At our annual shareholder meeting, four directors will be retiring from service. On behalf of the Board and management, I want to thank Phyllis Campbell, Michelle Ebanks, Robert Miller and Alison Winter for their leadership and many, many contributions over the years. This past year we also added three new independent directors: Tanya Domier, CEO of Advantage Solutions; Gordon Smith, CEO of Consumer and Community Banking at JPMorgan Chase and Brad Tilden, CEO of Alaska Air Group. Our new directors bring with them vast and broad experience, and a fresh perspective that is aligned with Nordstrom values and customer focus. We are pleased to welcome them aboard and, as we evolve and transition new members onto the Board and thank those who depart, we remain committed to having a diverse board that represents our customers, employees and communities. Each quarter the Board completes a rigorous evaluation of the business, reviewing subjects including strategies, expected returns and shareholder value. We were pleased that an outgrowth of those kinds of reviews resulted in the completion of the sale of our credit card receivables to TD Bank Group this past year. Upon the successful completion of the transaction, we were able to distribute proceeds of $1.8 billion to shareholders through a special cash dividend of $4.85 per share and an increase to the company's share repurchases. Our company's commitment to serving customers with quality products and services in the most efficient way possible is the foundation of our long-term growth strategy. As the Board looks to the future, we remain focused on opportunities to strategically position the business for long-term success and to hold ourselves and management accountable for bottom-line results. We know we must continue to evolve to meet rising customer expectations for service across all of our businesses, and we know that this will shape and define success in the near-term and for many years to come. On behalf of our entire Board of Directors, I thank you for your support of Nordstrom. On a personal note, I will be retiring as Chairman of the Board of Nordstrom, Inc. after the upcoming annual shareholder meeting. I have had the distinct honor and pleasure of serving Nordstrom shareholders in several capacities for approaching 20 years, including service as Lead Director for five years and Chairman for the last 10 years. This company has a long legacy of competing to better serve its customers and I am humbled that I was able to play some part in our past success. Should you, the shareholders, so choose, I will remain on the Board and will be pleased to transition the Chairman position to an extraordinarily qualified and capable Board member, Phil Satre. All of us on the Board are excited and confident in Phil's leadership and look forward to a strong future under his Chairmanship. Thank you for the opportunity to serve you, our shareholders.
