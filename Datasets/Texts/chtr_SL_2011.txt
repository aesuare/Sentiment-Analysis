Dear Shareholders,

Our Mission Drive growth and increase shareholder value by delivering simple, customer-oriented communications and entertainment solutions to consumers and businesses.
I joined Charter in February 2012. In my short time here I've been impressed with the Company's strong commitment to customers, solid strategy and effective teamwork. Charter has a robust network, capable of delivering a quality customer experience today, with the flexibility to add the communications and entertainment services of tomorrow. All of these attributes contributed to Charter's successes in 2011. The shift to a customercentric company began with the rollout of a wave of programs to transform the customer experience, building the foundation for earning the role as trusted advisor to our customers. Investments to upgrade the network to provide even faster speeds through DOCSIS 3.0 and increase capacity for high-definition (HD) and video-on-demand choices through switched digital video technology were essentially completed as of year-end. As the fourth largest cable provider in the United States, Charter continuously adds valuable new content, capabilities and devices on which our customers can enjoy video entertainment. This past year we significantly increased the number of HD channels available and added exciting new content. The distinction between television and the Internet is becoming less clear, and we're providing our customers with the capability to choose how, where and when to enjoy their favorite movies and shows. Customer choice, preferences and ease of use drive our new product offerings, including a unique online  search and discovery feature, which organizes online content from Charter and other popular online content into a single directory on Charter.net. Charter is widely recognized for its superior Internet service, including top rankings by multiple independent agencies and service providers. And with a growing number of connected devices in homes today, our in-home Wi-Fi service is growing in popularity. Rounding out our residential products, our phone service includes the latest in features, including online integration. Through these capabilities and those to come in 2012 and beyond, Charter is becoming the communications and entertainment solutions provider in our customers' homes.

I see tremendous opportunity for Charter. Our robust network passes 12 million homes along with businesses that spend an estimated $8.5 billion on communications services. We are making investments to drive growth in both the near and longer terms. We see a substantial opportunity to earn new customer relationships as well as expand our communications and entertainment solutions in our existing customers' homes. The  commercial side of the business also provides significant growth opportunity. We are gaining momentum as we move into 2012. We are focused on ensuring that we
