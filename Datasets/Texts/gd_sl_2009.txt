Letter to Shareholders
Dear Fellow Shareholders, Our company had a strong 2009, marked by outstanding performance across all of our defense businesses. This performance helped offset a difficult business-aviation market that affected our Aerospace segment. Overall, sales grew 9 percent, reaching nearly $32 billion. Operating earnings were $3.7 billion, with earnings from our Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups each exceeding $1 billion. Marine Systems also had a strong year, with solid revenue and earnings growth. Despite the worldwide economic crisis which significantly hurt the business-aviation industry, our Aerospace group earned over $700 million, an impressive accomplishment given the difficult market conditions. Free cash flow totaled $2.5 billion, after capital expenditures and contributions to our pension funds. This strong cash flow represents 103 percent of earnings from continuing operations, maintaining a trend of exceeding 100 percent cash conversion in each of the past five years. Report on Operations Our leadership remains focused on several elemental principles: organic growth, margin enhancement, outstanding operational performance, continuous improvement and efficient cash conversion. By every measure, our businesses continued to execute to these principles in 2009. Aerospace Aerospace performed admirably in 2009 despite the erosion of the business-aviation market caused by the economic crisis and negative public rhetoric regarding the use of business aircraft. Sales were $5.2 billion, down 6 percent from 2008, because of fewer new aircraft deliveries and lower aircraft service volume. Some of the decline in sales was offset by the addition of Jet Aviation. The group reacted to the market downturn by quickly resizing the business and aggressively cutting costs, which helped protect profitability and mitigate the impact of reduced volume. Operating earnings were $707 million and operating margins were 13.7 percent. Backlog at year end was $19.3 billion, not including $1.4 billion in long-term fractional agreements. The backlog was down from 2008 because of a large number of customer defaults in the first half of the year. Orders increased, however, in the second half of 2009 reflecting the overall improvement in the global economy and demand for our premier large-cabin Gulfstream aircraft. Our backlog remains robust and diverse by both customer type and geography. Our large aircraft order book extends well into 2011 and, for some models, into 2012. Over 60 percent of 2009 orders were international, with around three quarters of those from European and Asia-Pacific­based customers.

The market for our large-cabin aircraft improved throughout 2009, resulting in a slight increase to 2010 large-cabin deliveries. We believe this trend will continue. So far in 2010, we see increased demand for large cabin airplanes and we are beginning to see some renewed interest in our mid-size airplanes. Flying hours and aftermarket demand, which started to improve in the second half of 2009, continue to increase in 2010. The decline in pre-owned inventories is continuing and we have seen a sharp decrease in customer defaults. From our perspective, the business-aviation market is beginning to improve. Throughout this downturn, we remained committed to producing the next generation of Gulfstream aircraft and continued to invest in new product development. Our two newest aircraft, the G250 and G650, have been extremely well-received by the market. Particularly strong demand for the G650 has resulted in an order book that now extends beyond 2015. In late 2009, the G250 and G650 aircraft made successful first flights, just 14 and 20 months after their respective market introductions. Both aircraft remain on track as they continue extensive flight testing in preparation for FAA and EASA certification next year. At Jet Aviation, completion volume was strong, although we experienced a decline in service volume, in line with volume decreases at our other service facilities. Service activity was considerably slower in the first two quarters, but improved later in the year. We continued to make progress instituting our production process improvements in the wide-body and narrow-body completion lines and are beginning to experience marked efficiency improvements on the production floor. Looking ahead, we expect 2010 to be a good year for the Aerospace group and we are poised for more growth in 2011 as we begin delivering the first G250 and G650 airplanes. We also expect that our service and completions businesses will grow as the business-aviation market and world economy continue to improve. As always, we will continue to drive costs out of the business and improve processes in order to increase profitability. Combat Systems Combat Systems had an outstanding year. The group led the company in sales growth and operating earnings. Sales were $9.6 billion, an almost 18 percent increase from 2008, and operating earnings were $1.3 billion. The group experienced strong organic growth, driven by continued demand for our products across each of our business units. Some of our growth also came from AxleTech International, a company we acquired in December 2008.

Combat Systems' year-end backlog was $13.4 billion, of which $11.4 billion is fully funded. Demand for the group's products in 2009 was particularly strong in the two largest U.S. combat vehicle programs, Stryker armored vehicles and M1 Abrams main battle tanks. Orders for these programs, which totaled around $2.7 billion, included major upgrades and modifications to enhance survivability, mobility and soldier comfort. Orders also included a variety of other core programs including: commercial and military axles, ammunition, vehicle armor and precision munitions. International orders were also strong in 2009. We received orders for nearly $2.5 billion in foreign military sales contracts for tank upgrades and light armored vehicles. Order activity at our European Land Systems division was also robust, including new orders for several ground-combat vehicle variants. These international programs will extend over several years providing solid, steady growth in these markets. In addition to Combat Systems' robust backlog, opportunities for reset of U.S. equipment and additional international pursuits position the group to continue to perform very well. While we do not anticipate repeating the revenue growth rates we have seen in the last few years, I expect the group to continue to provide solid growth. Their focus on operational excellence will continue to ensure that they remain an earnings leader in the company. Marine Systems General Dynamics' three shipyards delivered their best year yet in 2009, with double digit sales and operating earnings growth. Sales grew nearly 15 percent to $6.4 billion. Much of this volume is in preparation for increasing our Virginia-class submarine build rate to two per year in 2011, and additional repair and engineering work across the group. Operating earnings grew 23 percent and margins were 10.1 percent ­ a noteworthy accomplishment realized through hard work and disciplined execution in all three shipyards. In 2009, the group delivered one Virginia-class submarine, two T-AKE combat-logistics ships, three commercial product carriers, one DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyer and the first Navy trimaran Littoral Combat Ship. The workload in 2010 is equally wholesome. We will continue to see more work on the Virginia Class, and expect volume to increase materially on the first DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyer. We will also continue to produce T-AKEs and begin work on the re-start of the DDG-51 program. Marine Systems' backlog decreased to $22.5 billion in 2009. Backlog fluctuations are typical for this group because our shipbuilding customers place large orders that provide work over multi-year periods. So far

in 2010, we have added to funded backlog two T-AKE ships, a Virginia-class submarine and advanced procurement for another DDG-51. We also anticipate receiving contracts for two additional DDG-1000s in the coming months. Our commercial shipbuilding program has been very successful. The first three ships were delivered last year ahead of schedule and under budget. We will deliver the two remaining commercial ships in backlog in 2010 and anticipate building additional ships as the economy recovers and commercial shipping customers return to the market to recapitalize their aging fleets. Our ship programs are well-supported in the Navy and the Congress. This support, when combined with the group's current backlog, positions our shipyards for continued growth.  Information Systems and Technology Information Systems and Technology remains the company's revenue leader. Sales grew 7.6 percent last year to $10.8 billion, from increased volume across the group's three core businesses. Earnings also grew 7.1 percent to over $1.1 billion, enabling the group to maintain 10.7 percent margins. In 2009, demand for products across IS&T's portfolio drove a record backlog of $10.3 billion. This backlog does not include $12.8 billion of indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity awards which we expect to convert to orders over time. Together, backlog and estimated potential contract value grew 12.9 percent through 2009 to $23.1 billion. IS&T's sales reflect the diversity of its portfolio. The group's tactical communications products are at the core of current and future Army battlefield communications, and they continue to drive growth. Our federal IT and intelligence services businesses enjoyed another year of double-digit growth, spurred by growing demand in healthcare IT, network development and cyber security markets. In 2009, 40 percent of sales were to intelligence and federal civilian agencies as well as international and commercial customers. We continue to enhance each of the group's three core segments with accretive acquisitions in attractive markets. In 2009, we deployed $800 million to acquire two companies for our IT services and ISR businesses. In January, we expanded our tactical communications business with the acquisition of a software company whose products provide soldiers an effective platform for collecting and sharing real-time intelligence. IS&T is pursuing a large pipeline of new opportunities in a variety of fast-growing areas. Current backlog, continued success in capturing new awards and future acquisitions position IS&T for continued growth. Defense Market Environment General Dynamics' defense portfolio was well-supported in the $660 billion fiscal year 2010 defense budget, which included $130 billion for emergency war spending. The 2010 budget included $185 billion in procurement and research and development funding which accounts for the majority of company sales. When added to our existing backlog, orders funded by this budget will help sustain our defense businesses for the next several years. In February, the release of several documents detailing the Defense Department's future budget priorities provided further visibility for our defense businesses. The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), which shapes budget requirements, reiterated the Defense Department's commitment to slow, steady inflation

adjusted spending growth. Defense funding will prioritize products at the center of today's fight while continuing to invest in capabilities that address a wide spectrum of conventional and asymmetric threats. Our products are pivotal to current operations and we are committed to continuing to evolve our offerings to provide new and timely capabilities to the warfighter. For fiscal year 2011, the Defense Department has requested total funding of $708 billion, including $159 billion in supplemental funding. The 2011 budget requests $189 billion for investment accounts, including a nearly 8 percent increase in procurement funding. Through 2015, the base defense budget is expected to grow at a low single-digit rate. Investment accounts will show similar growth, with procurement funding on mature in-production programs growing and research and development funding on newer projects declining over the period. These are wholesome budgets that provide solid support for our defense businesses for the forseeable future. Capital Deployment In 2009, we continued to invest in our businesses by spending $1.2 billion on capital expenditures and on two acquisitions for our IS&T group. We also provided $577 million in dividend payments and spent $209 million repurchasing our shares. The Board of Directors recently increased the dividend to $0.42, a 10.5 percent increase over the 2009 quarterly dividend. In June 2009, we took advantage of attractive rates to issue $750 million in two-year fixed rate notes. Strong cash from operations enabled us to pay down $900 million in debt and reduce year-end net debt by $1 billion. Our balance sheet is strong and provides ample opportunity to improve our financial performance through judicious capital deployment. In Closing The past year illustrated the benefits of the balance in our portfolio. Our defense segments drove growth in a year when our Aerospace business faced extremely difficult market conditions. As we look to the future, our defense businesses are well-situated with robust backlogs and a rich opportunity set that will spur steady growth. Barring any further deterioration in the global economy, I believe that 2010 is the start of an attractive growth trajectory in our Aerospace business. This was also a year of leadership transition for our company­Nick Chabraja and I worked diligently to make that transition seamless. I believe we accomplished this objective and I salute Nick for his remarkable leadership throughout the transition and in his preceding 12 years at the helm of General Dynamics. Your leadership team is dedicated to creating value for our fellow shareholders. This commitment has been one of the hallmarks of General Dynamics and will not change.
