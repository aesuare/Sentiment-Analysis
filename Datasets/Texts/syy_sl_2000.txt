  TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
SYSCO’s multi-dimensional objectives include strategic vision and prudent fiscal planning supported by brand width and service depth. In our 30th year as a public company, this combination produced record sales of $19.3 billion for the 52-week period ended July 1, 2000 compared to $17.4 billion generated in fiscal 1999 (53 weeks), an 11 percent increase.
Fueled by a thriving U.S. economy and mild winter weather conditions, the foodservice industry during our most recent fiscal year enjoyed real growth at the higher end of its historical two to four percent rate, as reported by industry sources. SYSCO was favorably impacted not only by these external factors, but also by numerous internal initiatives. Historically, SYSCO’s real growth has expanded two to three times faster than the real growth rate of the industry. FY 2000 was no exception, as
real growth for the year reached 9.2 percent after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 1999, acquisitions of 3.5 percent and food cost inflation of 0.4 percent.
Diluted earnings per share before a first quarter accounting change that required start-up costs to be expensed as incurred, rose significantly to $1.36, a 26 percent increase above the $1.08 per share earned in last year’s 53-week period. Net earnings before the accounting change were $453.6 million, 25 percent above the $362.3 million achieved in the 53 weeks of fiscal 1999.
Key internal drivers that enhanced results were a sharpened focus on increasing sales to marketing associate-served customers – our core business – and
continuing growth in SYSCO Brand sales. Marketing associate-served sales grew to 55.4 percent of traditional foodservice sales versus 54.1 percent last year, while the SYSCO Brand gained increasing recognition and acceptance, rising to 50.4 percent of marketing-associate served sales, compared to 48.1 percent in fiscal 1999.
The SYGMA Network, Inc., our chain restaurant distribution specialist, generated record sales of $2.2 billion, an 8 percent increase compared to fiscal 1999. In May SYGMA began servicing 362 additional Burger King restaurants located in Pennsylvania and Northern California, as well as Arby’s units in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. These customer additions represent approximately $200 million in annualized sales and we continue to selectively seek additional chain restaurant business.
Six strategic acquisitions completed during the year strengthened both geographical presence and product offerings. They include three custom-cutting meat operations, two broadline distributors, and a specialty produce company. Through our Buckhead Beef Company

(Atlanta, GA), Malcolm Meats (Toledo, OH) and Newport Meat Company (Irvine, CA) operations, SYSCO now offers precision custom- cut steaks and other protein products to customers in certain areas. Broadline distributors Doughtie’s Foods Inc. (Portsmouth, VA) and Watson Foodservice (Lubbock, TX) enhanced customer service in the mid-Atlantic and southwestern United States. Annualized sales of these five companies totaled approximately $500 million in the aggregate.
The combination of FreshPoint, Inc. (approximately $750 million in annualized sales) with SYSCO’s $1 billion produce operation created the largest foodservice produce purchaser and supplier in the world. SYSCO now offers a full spectrum of produce in numerous varieties, from everyday staples to the exotic. Opportunities also exist for strategic product cross selling through both customer bases.
Internal geographic expansion remains a priority and “fold-out” operations under construction in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia and in Sacramento, California should be operational in the spring and fall of 2001, respectively. The Hampton Roads facility will replace Doughtie’s existing complex and supply their customers in Virginia and eastern North Carolina, as well as certain customers in those areas who are now being serviced from Pocomoke City, Maryland. The Sacramento operation will serve Sacramento and surrounding communities, as
well as western Nevada and northern California markets now being accommodated from San Francisco.
These activities plus ongoing maintenance programs resulted
in investments of $266 million in facilities, fleet and equipment, with facilities and fleet accounting for 72 percent. This compared
to capital expenditures of $287 million in FY 1999. Capital expenditures for FY 2001 are expected to range from $325 million to $375 million. SYSCO continues to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund internal growth opportunities.
Since 1996 SYSCO has been repurchasing shares in excess of those issued and at fiscal year-end 58 million shares had been repurchased, including 5.7 million during FY 2000, with 3.8 million remaining out of the 8-million-share 1999 authorization. After funding working capital needs, capital investments, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, total debt was $1.07 billion, including $1.02 billion long- term debt, resulting in a long-term debt to total capitalization ratio of 37 percent. Before the accounting change, return on shareholders’ equity was 29 percent and return on average total capital was 17 percent.
SYSCO Uniform System (SUS) installations were completed last December as planned in scheduled broadline companies, providing operational efficiencies through valuable managerial and reporting tools. SYSCO also has joined McDonald's Corporation, Cargill Inc.

  and Tyson Foods Inc. to form electronic Foodservice Network (eFS Network), an Internet-based, business-to-business (B2B) network. Open to suppliers, distributors and chain restaurant operators, eFS Network is aimed at cutting costs in the foodservice supply chain by more efficiently managing the flow of information and products to the marketplace.
More than 40,000 employees dedicated to outstanding customer service were instrumental in SYSCO’s stellar FY 2000 performance and several members of management were recognized for their part in SYSCO’s success. In January, in accordance with SYSCO’s long-term management succession plan, Charles H. Cotros was elected the fourth chief executive officer in SYSCO’s 30-year history. Mr. Cotros also assumed the role of chairman on July 2, 2000 following the retirement of Bill M. Lindig after a distinguished 30-year career. Also, Richard J. Schnieders advanced to President and Chief Operating Officer; Larry J. Accardi was promoted to Executive Vice President, Merchandising Services and Multi-Unit Sales; Thomas E. Lankford became Executive Vice President, Foodservice Operations and, upon Mr. Lindig’s retire- ment, was elected to serve the remaining portion of his Board term; and John K. Stubblefield, Jr. was named Executive Vice President, Finance and Administration.
In November 1999 the Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend 20 percent to $0.12 per share from $0.10 per share, the 31st increase in 30 years.
We are optimistic about SYSCO’s future prospects, anticipating an ongoing positive economic outlook and continued demand for meals prepared away from home. We believe our long-term objectives are achievable – high single-digit real sales growth with earnings per share growing four to six percentage points higher than the real sales growth rate, a 30 percent return on equity and a long-term debt to total capital- ization ratio of 35 to 40 percent. We intend to seek growth opportunities through acquisitions and continue our internal expansion strategies as well. As we move forward, our commitment to providing our customers
a breadth of products for nearly every foodservice need, as well as unsurpassed service excellence, will continue to drive our future success.
