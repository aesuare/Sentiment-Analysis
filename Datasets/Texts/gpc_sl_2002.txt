 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
We would characterize the year of 2002 as another challenging one but with a number of positives to report for Genuine Parts Company. First, we can report that both sales and earnings increased for the year. The increases were modest but returned us to the pattern of improving our results as we have done consistently through the years. Secondly, we can report that we remain financially strong and with a balance sheet that will support our opportunities and activities for the future.

 Total sales reached $8.25 billion in 2002, up slightly compared to the previous year. Net earnings were $367 million, an increase of 2%. Earnings on a per share basis were $2.10 compared to the $2.08 produced in 2001. The earnings number for 2002 is before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and the 2001 earnings figure excludes the effect of non–recur- ring charges taken in the final quarter of that year. After the cumulative effect adjustment described in the next paragraph, we had a net loss in 2002 of $27.6 million and in 2001, net income of $297.1 million including the effect of the non-recur- ring charges.
As we mentioned in our 2002 first quarter report, we recorded a non-cash charge of $395 million as of January 1, 2002 related to our goodwill impairment. This adjustment resulted from the completion of impairment testing in conjunction with the new Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”. The charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting. The majority of the goodwill written down related to acquisitions made in 1998 and 1999 and under prior accounting standards would have been amortized over an extended period of time. Our core U.S. operations for NAPA, Motion and S.P. Richards were
not affected by this change and we continue to have a positive outlook on the operations that were affected by this change.
Financial Strength
The Company’s financial condition is excellent and our balance sheet remains strong. Our current assets were 3.1 times current liabilities at the end of the year. To fund our cash requirements we generated $498 million in cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures of $65 million were in our normal range and included funds to maintain and improve our facilities, equipment, systems and technology projects. We also used cash
to reduce our total debt in 2002 by approximately $100 mil- lion, decreasing our total debt to total capitalization ratio to 27% compared to 28% at the end of 2001. Continued reduc- tion of our debt will remain a priority for us again in 2003. During the year the Company also purchased approximately 400,000 shares of our Company stock, leaving a balance of 7.2 million shares authorized to be repurchased. We believe that a gradual share repurchase plan combined with a meaningful cash dividend will add value for our shareholders over time.
Dividends
2002 was our 46th consecutive year of dividend increases, with dividends of $1.16 per share. We are proud of our dividend record, and are pleased that on February 17, 2003, the Board of Directors increased the cash dividend payable April 1, 2003 to an annual rate of $1.18 per share. This equals 56% of our 2002 earnings before the effect of a change in accounting principle and becomes our 47th consecutive year of dividend increases.
Progress in Operations
As we mentioned earlier in our remarks we were able to show improvement in both sales and earnings for the year. At mid year our results in sales and earnings trailed the previous year and it was apparent that our economy was showing little change to stimulate business activity. We feel fortunate that our operations found a way in the second half of the year to generate an improved picture with revenue gains in both the third and fourth quarters.
For the year, revenues in our Automotive Group were up
2% for the year and presented our most consistent picture with sales showing some increase in all four quarters. While this level of growth does not meet our expectations for the longer term, we believe the fundamentals are in place to support a gradual

 improvement in the automotive after- market in the months and years ahead. Vehicle demographics, miles driven and a number of other factors are favorable for our future in the Automotive segment. In addition, we believe that our NAPA marketing plans in the U.S. and Canada, along with growth plans in our other Automotive activities, will accelerate our growth as we move through 2003.
After a slow start both Motion Industries and S.P. Richards, our Industrial and Office Products segments, posted sales gains for the year driven by a positive performance in the later months. Both segments produced revenue increases of 5% in the final quarter and outpaced market growth in their industries. EIS, our Electrical segment, was down 6% for the final quarter, and while we never like decreases, this was their smallest
in a number of quarters and the worst certainly seems to be behind us for this business group.
We can quickly summarize by saying that we believe each of our businesses will continue a gradual improvement in revenues in the coming months of 2003. We see no major breakthroughs but just steady improvement toward the mid single digit range for GPC. We have made our growth plans for 2003 with no anticipation that the economy will show meaningful change. We expect
that all our business segments will also operate more efficiently so that earnings growth will meet or slightly exceed our revenue growth.
As a closing note on operations, we believe we can do a better job of managing our inventories in 2003. Inventories are a major investment for us and both our balance sheet and our earnings will benefit from our efforts in
this area. Our Industrial and Automotive operations in particular offer opportuni- ties for meaningful improvement and this will be accomplished without impacting our service levels, which remain excellent at this time.
GPC Directors
Two of our outstanding Directors, Bradley Currey, Jr. and Alana S. Shepherd, have reached the retirement age for our Directors and will retire in April. Mr. Currey is the retired Chairman of the Board of Directors of Rock-Tenn Company and has served on our Board since 1990. Ms. Shepherd is Secretary of the Board of Directors of The Shepherd Center and has served as a Director of the Company since 1993. We wish to thank Brad and Alana for their years of valuable service to our Company. They have both been splendid contributors to our Company and we will miss them.
We are asking the shareholders to elect two new Directors at the April 21, 2003 Shareholders’ Meeting. The GPC Board, at its scheduled meeting in November 2002, elected Dr. Mary Brown Bullock and Mr. John D. Johns to serve on our Board and invited them to be nominees for election by the shareholders. Dr. Bullock is President of Agnes Scott College, in Atlanta, Georgia and is the current Chair of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities (NAICU), an organization that represents nearly 1,000 U.S. higher education insti- tutions. Mr. Johns is Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Protective Life Corporation, in Birmingham, Ala- bama and has held positions of President and Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer of Protective Life. Dr. Bullock and Mr. Johns bring a high level of expertise to our Board and we will be
most fortunate to have them join us. We look forward to the strength and talents they will provide in the coming years.
Looking Ahead
Despite facing a difficult economy
with no immediate signs of substantial improvement, we look ahead to 2003 with plans for continued growth in both sales and earnings. Most of our gains will come from organic growth and increased unit volume as we do not anticipate material acquisitions in our businesses and we expect only modest price increases. We are fortunate to be market leaders in each of our four business segments, and the markets we serve remain highly fragmented. Growth opportunities are there for us and we are optimistic that we can achieve market share gains as we look ahead.
We hope you will take time to review the remainder of the Annual Report. Our plans and programs for our four business groups are described in some detail in these pages.
In closing, we thank our outstanding group of customers, suppliers and the entire GPC team for their dedicated efforts in 2002 and their commitment to a successful year of growth in 2003.
Respectfully submitted,
Larry L. Prince Chairman of the Board
Thomas C. Gallagher President
