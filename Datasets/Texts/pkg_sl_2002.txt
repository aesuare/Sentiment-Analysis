In 2002, PCA continued to make considerable prog- ress in the face of another difficult and challenging year. The U.S. economy remained both sluggish
and uncertain, with the industry experiencing another year of weak demand for corrugated products. We did manage to get a price increase in August, but container- board prices were still significantly lower than in 2001. Certain costs such as fiber, energy and medical expenses also increased appreciably. As a result, our profitability declined in 2002.
On a more positive note, the industry did continue
to demonstrate supply discipline in the face of weak demand, and industry consolidation and rationalization of capacity also continued. Industry analysts have reported that over 1.15 million tons of containerboard capacity was removed from the industry in 2002, bringing the total capacity removed since 1998 to almost 5.5 million tons.
PCA responded to these difficult economic conditions by continuing to focus on the basics of the business: serving our customers well, keeping controllable costs down and using the cash that we generate wisely. We believe that all of these things lead to better share- holder value. For the year, PCA’s stock price closed up 0.5% at $18.24 per share while all major averages and indexes were down dramatically.

For 2002, our net income was $48 million or $0.45 per share compared to $106 million or $0.98 per share in 2001, a $0.53 per share decline. The single biggest factor impacting earnings was, by far, lower prices for containerboard and corrugated products, which lowered full year earnings by $0.56 per share.
Other items adversely impacting 2002 earnings were higher recycled fiber prices, medical costs and depre- ciation. The negative impact of these items was, how-

ever, more than offset by increased containerboard and corrugated products volume and lower interest expense.
It should also be noted that PCA’s 2002 earnings did not benefit, as many companies did, from the changes in accounting treatment for goodwill amortization since PCA has essentially no goodwill recorded on its balance sheet. Alternatively, PCA will not be faced with the potential impairment charges associated with carrying goodwill as an asset on its balance sheet.
PCA continued to make considerable progress in building a strong and growing customer base, even in a weak economy. We’ve worked hard to show our customers that we’re easy to do business with and provide the best value. As a result, our corrugated products volume was up 3.9% per workday for the year compared to an industry increase of only 0.4% per workday. This marks the fifth consecutive year we have outperformed the industry, four of which were by a wide margin.
These debt reduction efforts have dramatically lowered our interest expense and have transformed PCA’s finan- cial position and balance sheet into one of the strongest in the industry. Our credit ratios, commonly used by the ratings agencies, are very strong with a year-end debt to EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times, EBITDA to interest at 4.6 times and our debt to total capital at 48%.
enters 2003 with considerable operating
strengths. We start with an operationally excellent, low-cost containerboard manufacturing sys- tem, which possesses both energy and fiber flexibility. Our level of containerboard integration with our own corrugated products plants is high at 80%. And finally, our geographic presence and coverage is consider- able, with 64 corrugated products plants across the U.S. serving a large and diverse customer base. This is very important, since our business is both freight and customer service intensive.
While we have not yet seen a meaningful improvement in the U.S. economy, one bright spot that has emerged has been the continual weakening of the dollar during this past year. This should make U.S. containerboard more price competitive in foreign markets. It should also help reduce the U.S. trade deficit which, in turn, should help improve domestic corrugated demand. Both of these developments would be big positives for the containerboard and corrugated products industry.
In closing, we recognize that our challenges in 2003 remain great and are tied, in large part, to the U.S. economy. With that said, be assured that our focus,
commitment and efforts on improving shareholder value will continue. Operational excellence and customer focus will remain the keys to our success in 2003 as will our emphasis on the generation and effective utili- zation of free cash.

PCA also continued to generate strong cash flow and improve its financial position. For the year, we gener- ated $240 million in cash from operating activities. Capital expenditures for 2002 were $107 million.
The remaining $133 million of available cash was used to pay down $53 million of long-term debt and repurchase 1.9 million shares of our common stock
for $33 million. Cash-on-hand, which also included $2 million from non-operating activities, increased
by $49 million to $131 million. In the past three years, PCA has generated $895 million in cash from operations, of which $368 million was used for capital expenditures. Since becoming a stand-alone company in April 1999, we have reduced our total long-term debt by $1.13 billion.
