  MESSAGE TO FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
 2005 was a good year for our company. Our product line diversification and broad global coverage enabled us to deliver record revenues and net earnings. Strong performances in our infrastructure businesses more than offset a significant downturn in our irrigation businesses, both in the U.S. and abroad.
In my letter to you last year I mentioned two specific areas where, in my opinion, we needed to improve: Operating income as a percentage of sales, and efficient
use of our invested capital. I am pleased to report progress in both areas. Our operating income increased from 6.8 percent of sales in 2004 to 7.6 percent in 2005, and I am confident that we will see further improvement during 2006. We reduced our working capital significantly during 2005, and our return on invested capital improved. Our strong cash flow allowed us to reduce our long-term debt to well within our comfort zone.
The Engineered Support Structures Segment, which consists of poles, towers and specialty structures for the lighting, traffic and wireless communications markets posted strong growth both in revenue and earnings. In the U.S. market, we are starting to see demand improve under the new Federal Highway Bill, and we are making good progress in building a highway sign structures business. We experienced much less turbulence in the steel markets during 2005 compared to 2004, which helped us return to more traditional margin levels. Internationally, I am very pleased to report record results

both in Europe and China. We streamlined and simplified our European organiza- tional structure during 2004, and our team there delivered much improved results in 2005. In China we had our ninth consecutive year of improved sales and earnings. Our second manufacturing plant in the south of China should be in production by April of this year, ready to serve an ever-growing need for support structures in this important region.
In our Utility Support Structures Segment, 2005 was the first full year
of integrated operations for the Valmont steel utility pole business and Newmark International’s pre-stressed spun concrete and steel utility pole business. Revenues grew significantly while operating income nearly tripled. We now have the industry’s most complete product line, serving a utility market which presents numerous opportunities for growth.
In our Irrigation Segment we were
faced with challenges worldwide. Crop prices in general were not strong, and combined with escalating energy prices, put pressure on farm income. Our team did a good job of managing through
this period of declining revenues while preserving acceptable profitability levels. Our irrigation business has always been a cyclical business, and today it is a good business in the down cycle and a great business in the up cycle. Water conserva- tion is a global issue that will not go away and we continue to have great enthusiasm for this business.
Last year I predicted that our Tubing Segment would not be able to match the record performance of 2004. I was wrong! Their operating profit set a new record as they continued to focus on superior customer service in their niche markets.

  VISION
 Our Coatings Segment delivered flat sales compared to 2004, but with twice the operating income as their mix of business was much improved. The galvanizing business showed new strength and
our anodizing subsidiary in California returned to profitability.
We made some major changes in the responsibilities of our senior operating managers in 2005 to give them new challenges. Tom Spears is now responsible for our engineered support structures business in the U.S. and Canada as well as our coatings businesses. Earl Foust oversees our steel and concrete pole businesses serving the utility market
in the U.S. Len Adams has responsibility for our U.S. irrigation business in addition to managing the tubing business. We also established a new International Division, adding Victor Grizzle to our senior management team to be respon- sible for accelerating growth outside
North America and driving leverage among our international irrigation and structures businesses.
While I am pleased with our 2005 results,
I believe we can continue to improve.
We are taking aggressive actions to drive earnings improvement and growth across all businesses. We are placing strategic focus on three initiatives that we believe will drive financial performance:
Pricing Initiative. Because pricing is a key component in building revenue and profitability, we are examining elements of our pricing processes to ensure our products and services are priced appro- priately and commensurate with the value they provide to our customers.
