 A letter from the chairman We appreciate your interest in Lexmark International. During 2001, Lexmark observes its 10th anniversary as a company. From its exciting beginning as a spin-off from IBM, Lexmark has grown to become a global leader in printers, associated supplies and services.
Lexmark is unique because the company’s attention is totally focused on providing printing solutions. Competitors can’t say that. We develop and own the technology inside our printers. They can’t say that, either. It makes us much more able to rapidly respond to customer desires, shifts in the marketplace and new technologies. This makes Lexmark a highly dynamic company. That’s good for our customers. It’s exciting for our employees. To date, it has been rewarding
for our stockholders.
We may be a printer company, but ideas are our business. Our creative, energized Lexmark team has produced a continuous stream of industry-leading innovations: The first photographic-quality 1,200 x 1,200 dots per inch resolution. The first “family” of laser printers sharing common supplies.
The creation of the sub-$100 inkjet printer market. The list could go on and on, but Lexmark’s most important accomplishment has been the consistent delivery of quality, economy and originality in hardware, software and services.
As a young company in a highly competitive market, Lexmark had to be nimble and innovative. We chose to target large industries with very specialized needs. Our tailored printing solutions have made us the leader in serving pharmacies,
