A word from Jim Vincent . . . The annual Letter to Shareholders is written jointly by Jim Mullen, Biogen's Chief Executive Officer, and me. It reports on our organization's progress during the past year. I am taking this opportunity to underscore the importance of the management transition in 2000 and the quality of the individual leading Biogen through its next major period of growth. Jim Mullen joined our Company in 1989 as Director, Facilities and Engineering, and was named Vice President, Operations, in 1992. From 1996 - 1999, he served as Vice President, International, with responsibility for building all Biogen operations outside North America. From the beginning, it was apparent that Jim is an executive of exceptional quality, combining high intelligence with discipline, vision and exceptional leadership skills. His many accomplishments include creating our manufacturing and distribution operations, building our business operations outside the U.S. and successfully registering and launching AVONEX throughout Europe. In his many different assignments, Jim has consistently demonstrated his ability to identify, inspire and retain exceptionally talented individuals, as well as the ability to lead large and diverse organizations and manage complex situations. In my years with Biogen, I have watched our Company evolve from a research boutique to one of the world's leading global biopharmaceutical organizations. We are now in one of the most exciting times of our history, as we meet the challenges of bringing the organization to its next operating level. I am delighted an executive of Jim Mullen's caliber is leading us at this critical time in our Company's evolution.

James L. Vincent Chairman of the Board
