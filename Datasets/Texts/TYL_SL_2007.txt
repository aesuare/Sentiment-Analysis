Maintaining Our Velocity
To Our Shareholders:
In 2007, Tyler Technologies posted our best operating results ever as a software company, surpassing a record-setting performance in 2006. Ending 2007, our numbers were the highest yet in terms of revenues, operating income, and free cash flow, even as we invested heavily for the future through product development. We
also ended 2007 with an all-time high in backlog of signed business at $250 million. We attribute much of our success to the dedication of our employees — a team that now totals more than 1,700 professionals with a deep understanding of both technological innovation and the inner workings of local governments. This knowledge, coupled with our singular focus, broad solutions portfolio, and proven growth strategies, continued to set Tyler apart in 2007.
Another Record Year
With 27 consecutive quarters of profitability, Tyler marked our most successful year yet by
virtually every financial measure. We ended 2007 with our best quarterly results ever in terms of total revenue, license revenue, and operating income in the fourth quarter. For the year, we showed revenue growth of 13 percent over 2006 and operating income of $26.8 million, up 23 percent over the previous year. Our free cash flow hit $30 million, an increase of 35 percent over 2006. Thanks to this consistently strong cash flow, we are well positioned to invest in future growth through product development, acquisitions and stock repurchases. In 2007, we invested a portion of our free cash flow to buy back $14 million of our stock and used $9 million of cash
for acquisitions.
Our overall software license revenue was
off 6 percent from 2006, in part because of an increase in the number and size of customers selecting our subscription-based options, rather than purchasing the software under a perpetual license. Although these software-as-a-service

In 2007, Tyler Technologies far surpassed our record-setting 2006 performance. We ended 2007 with all-time-high revenue, operating income, and free cash flow. We signed new business at a faster pace, ending the year with a $250 million backlog of signed business, up more than 21 percent over last year. By virtually every financial measure, 2007 was our best year yet — illustrating that we are, indeed, right on track.
(SaaS) revenues accounted for less than five percent of our total, they represented the fastest growing component of revenue — up 43 percent in 2007.
While Tyler’s gross margin
improved sequentially each quarter,
gross margin for the year was basically
flat with 2006. Several factors
contributed to this, including our
revenue mix, as well as significant
additions to our development and
four statewide contracts for Odyssey, as well as contracts with some of the largest counties in the nation. Total revenues from our Financial Management and Education solutions also grew in line with our overall growth rate, even as we experienced increased adoption of our subscription-based SaaS model.
Acquisitions supplemented our internal growth strategy in 2007
as we added two companies
that expand our presence in the education market. Early in the year, we acquired Advanced Data Systems, which provides financial management solutions for some 300 clients, primarily New England school districts. In September, we acquired EDP Enterprises, which provides financial and student information management systems for approximately 80 public school districts in Texas.
Early in 2008, we have already completed two promising acquisitions to complement our existing solutions for the education market. These include Schoolmaster, a student information solution that
is used in more than 1,900 schools in 40 states, and VersaTrans, which provides transportation management solutions to 1,300 school districts across the U.S. and Canada.
implementation staff to help deliver
our growing backlog of business, which increased faster than revenues in 2007.
A Proven Strategy
In 2007, Tyler bolstered the strong foundation we had established
in recent years. We consistently executed on four key growth strategies: expanding geographically, broadening our product offerings, securing larger opportunities, and cross-selling our solutions. Building on our success in 2006, Tyler’s strong showing in 2007 once again illustrated that we are maintaining the right pace for sustainable growth.
Contributing to this growth was the ongoing success of our Odyssey Courts and Justice solution. In fact, in 2007 license revenues from our Courts and Justice solutions were up
26 percent over 2006. We now have

A Solid Investment
At Tyler, we are always looking for ways to deliver
the best return on our shareholders’ investments.
We believe our solid performance in 2007 provides
us the momentum to continue building on this
growth throughout 2008. A strong indicator of our overall performance, Tyler’s free cash flow of $30 million exceeded GAAP net income by more than
73 percent. This gives us the flexibility to invest aggressively in our products and strategically supplement organic growth with acquisitions, as well as return cash to shareholders through our ongoing stock repurchase program. Looking to 2008 and beyond, we expect to continue seeking out and acting upon acquisition opportunities that broaden our
product offering, while growing our customer base across the markets we serve.
We believe Tyler’s joint development partnership with Microsoft also provides considerable long-term growth potential. We are accelerating R&D spending on our development of public sector functionality for Microsoft’s Dynamics AX business management solution. Beginning in 2010, we anticipate this partnership will enable us to generate incremental revenues from new channels, including federal and international markets, while continuing to expand our presence in our traditional markets.
A Bright Future
As we close 2007 and look to the future, Tyler is poised to play an even more significant role in helping local governments streamline the many aspects of their financial management, education, courts, tax, public safety, citizen services, and document management systems. We are making considerable investments in new products which we believe have great potential in the years to come. With a broad portfolio of feature-rich solutions, deep domain expertise, and exceptional customer service, Tyler is ready to capitalize on a large and growing local government market. We believe the coming year will be one of continued growth as we consistently execute our strategy and tap new opportunities.
