Dear fellow shareholders: Last year was one of the most challenging years for Avery Dennison in the past decade. Although the Company clearly felt the impact of the past year's sluggish business conditions in North America and Europe, we are pleased that we finished the year with a solid fourth quarter in which we reported better-than-expected top-line growth and earnings. Our annual sales grew almost 15 percent in 2003, driven primarily by acquisitions and the positive impact of currency translation, to reach a record high of $4.8 billion. Our reported net income for the year grew more than 4 percent, and diluted earnings per share increased more than 3 percent, which included the net effect of current-year and prior-year restructuring charges and the impact of discontinued operations. Our improved performance in the fourth quarter demonstrates not only the strength of our underlying growth drivers, but also the talent and determination of our 20,300 employees around the world. In the face of lackluster industrial and consumer demand, increased pricing pressures in many of our markets and the integration of operations from acquisitions, Avery Dennison employees met numerous challenges head-on with an intense focus on cost reduction, productivity improvement and creative business solutions. Integrating operations from acquisitions We have nearly completed the integration of our 2002 acquisitions of Jackstädt and RVL into Avery Dennison's global operations and, as planned, we expect the final stages of the integration process to be successfully completed during the first half of 2004. We are pleased to have surpassed our customer retention goals throughout the integration process, which has been a complicated and lengthy effort, exacerbated by difficult economic conditions. By substantially expanding our scale of operations in the pressure-sensitive adhesive materials industry, the addition of Jackstädt is driving significant cost synergies, as well as increasing our presence in key international markets and enhancing our product lines. With the addition of RVL operations to our Retail Information Services business, we can now offer the full line of brand identification products and data management services that our customers in the retail and apparel industries require.

PEOPLE AVERY DENNISON EMPLOYEES RESPONDED TO CHALLENGES HEAD-ON WITH AN INTENSE FOCUS ON COST REDUCTION, PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT AND CREATIVE BUSINESS SOLUTIONS.

Investing for growth Our strategies for growth are consistent: to accelerate top-line growth by extending the geographic reach of our business, by developing products that fulfill the unmet needs of our customers, and by adding manufacturing capabilities, product lines and technology enhancements through acquisition, as needed. Amid difficult business conditions and intensified expense reduction efforts, we continued to make strategic investments to grow our businesses for the long term. We are strengthening our global footprint with investments of capital and human resources in key geographic regions, especially in the high-growth potential markets of Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. In fact, by the fourth quarter of 2003, sales at our businesses in these emerging markets were approaching 20 percent of our total revenues, and they continue to grow briskly at double-digit rates. In particular, our business in China has been a source of robust growth for Avery Dennison since we opened our first pressure-sensitive adhesive materials manufacturing plant there 10 years ago. Sales growth and profitability in the country have consistently exceeded our expectations. In 2003, sales of pressure-sensitive materials in China grew more than 30 percent over the previous year, and we expect continued excellent growth as we expand our manufacturing, finishing, distribution and sales capabilities. By 2006, we expect to have invested a total of approximately $175 million in our operations in China, with every key Avery Dennison business having a manufacturing presence in the country. New Horizons We have started to transform our approach for generating top-line growth ­ changing the way we do business by changing the way we think about business. Avery Dennison employees throughout the Company have enthusiastically embraced our global growth initiative, known internally as the Horizons growth process. This initiative excites and motivates every employee in our Company as creativity, innovation, cross-divisional exchange and risk-taking come together in the "Can Do" spirit that is the theme of this annual report.

PRODUCTIVITY CONTINUOUS PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT NOW EXTENDS TO VIRTUALLY EVERY FACET OF OUR BUSINESS AND THROUGHOUT OUR ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN, MAKING IT A WAY OF LIFE IN THE COMPANY.

This Company-wide program consists of three distinct platforms that we call Horizons 1, 2 and 3. The process brings together teams of people ­ some that cross divisions and disciplines in the Company, and some that include customers ­ to develop solutions that fulfill the unmet needs of our customers. In 2003, we commercialized the first products created by our Horizon 1 program ­ a fast-track process in which a team is given a 100-day deadline to solve a specific problem in order to meet a customer need. The revenue generated in 2003 by these Horizon 1 projects reached approximately $50 million in annualized incremental sales, achieving our ambitious initial goals. We have found that there is a certain psychological magic associated with a short 100-day timeframe, which sparks a sense of urgency and high energy among team members. There are currently about 550 Horizon 1 teams hard at work creating and seizing new business opportunities across the Company, with more than 2,300 employees serving on them. The longer-duration Horizon 2 and Horizon 3 projects explore new technologies and markets within a rigorous strategic framework. Horizon 2 projects are ventures ­ many of them entrepreneurial in nature ­ that target a defined market or group of customers and operate with a focused business plan. As these projects require time to take root and often involve the development of new skills, investments and resources, they take approximately 18 months to two years to generate revenue. Horizon 3 activities take the form of research projects, alliances and investments in emerging technologies or companies, all of which pursue long-term business ideas that have growth potential. Although the exploratory nature of Horizon 3 projects means that some will be eliminated along the way, we will continue to invest in those ideas that have high potential to thrive in the future. RFID: A highly promising opportunity Radio frequency identification (RFID) is swiftly becoming a vital technology of the future, and we see excellent opportunities for Avery Dennison's role in bringing RFID applications to markets around the world. We have core competencies in materials science, precision printing and

Avery Dennison 2003

high-speed roll-to-roll manufacturing ­ capabilities that are instrumental in developing RFID solutions. Our expertise in applying coatings onto substrate surfaces to produce pressuresensitive adhesive materials and in manufacturing specialized labels in quantities of hundreds of millions, even billions, is ideal for developing the media in which RFID microprocessor chips can be embedded ­ and attached to ­ a variety of products. As more companies announce their goals to incorporate RFID technology into their supply-chain management systems, we are exceptionally well-positioned to provide customized applications to meet their needs. We are currently working with leading technology and merchandising companies, such as Microsoft and Metro AG, to provide RFID tags and labels for several pilot initiatives. We plan to double our investment in developing our RFID business in 2004, with the expectation that the operation will begin to generate revenue by the end of the year, and sales will grow in 2005 and beyond. Productivity improvement never ends Six Sigma continues to be the foundation of productivity improvement at Avery Dennison. With thousands of Six Sigma-trained employees throughout the Company, we have extended the program into virtually every facet of our business, making continuous productivity improvement a way of life. By aligning our Six Sigma activities with lean manufacturing concepts, we are able to more accurately assess where our greatest opportunities for savings, productivity improvement and enhanced customer satisfaction lie, as well as more effectively manage our total supply chain. In addition, we are increasingly reaping the benefits of applying this methodology to our internal business process improvement initiatives. Board transition This past year marked the retirement of Sidney R. Petersen from our board of directors after 21 years of dedicated service. We are grateful to Sid for his excellent advice and counsel over the years. His expertise in financial management and international operations was invaluable during a period when the Company experienced significant growth and change.

GROWTH OUR APPROACH TO GROWTH DURING THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS BY CHANGING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT BUSINESS.

Looking ahead In 2004, we will continue to look to our strong business fundamentals to guide our growth. We have the right people in place, the right assets with which to work, the right portfolio of market-leading brands, products and businesses, as well as the right tools designed to accomplish our aggressive goals. We expect continued pressure on operating margins and profitability during the first half of 2004 ­ due primarily to expenses associated with the completion of the Jackstädt integration ­ while we sustain our focus on major cost-reduction efforts throughout the Company. At the same time, we look forward to the expected significant improvement in our financial performance during the second half of the year, once we finish our integration efforts and business conditions continue to improve in key markets around the world. The Horizons growth-acceleration process gives us a powerful structure for driving topline growth and, most importantly, for steadily replenishing an active pipeline of new products in development. Our persistent focus on nonprice advantages for customers continues to differentiate Avery Dennison in the marketplace, including our reputation for high-quality products, innovative product features, superior speed and reliability of delivery and marketleading customer service. At the same time, our Six Sigma efforts are providing outstanding returns for us in terms of productivity improvement. We will continue to expand our Horizons and Six Sigma activities, which have now become pervasive throughout our culture. Our commitment to maintaining and increasing shareholder value is rock solid, and serves as the foundation of our long-term strategies for growth. We are encouraged by the numerous opportunities we are identifying to introduce new products in our many markets. We are optimistic about our future, with our expectation that 2004 will mark the turning point in our profitability trend, putting us on course to achieve solid growth over the long term.
