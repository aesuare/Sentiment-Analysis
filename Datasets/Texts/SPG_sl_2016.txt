  FROM
THE &CHAIRMAN
CEO
Dear Fellow Stockholders,
Here we go again. No, I am not talking about the constant narrative that retail real estate and the mall are becoming disenfranchised given the growth in internet retailing. I am referring to our record financial performance.
 Funds from Operations (“FFO”) increased to $3.8 billion or $10.49 per share (a record). Our dividend increased 7.4% to a total
of $6.50 per share (a record) and we are
on track to pay at least $7.00 per share (a new record) for 2017. In our first year as a public company (1993) our FFO was $78 million, or $1.92 per share, and our dividend was $1.90 per share. We have enjoyed total growth of $3.7 billion in FFO and an increase of $5.10 per share in our dividend since then. Importantly, and let’s not forget, we have produced a total return to stock- holders of 2,654% since our IPO versus the S&P 500 of 659% over the same period. The ability to produce those kinds of returns and profitability has been the hallmark of Simon Property Group (“Simon” or “SPG”). Investing for the future, grinding out prof- itability and avoiding the noise on the mall narrative that has existed for at least two decades is something we are very proud of.
As many of our shareholders know, we focus on portfolio net operating income (“NOI”) growth which produces cash flow growth. In 2016, we grew our portfolio NOI by over $380 million. This one-year growth is larger than the annual NOI for over 50% of the REITs included in the REIT index (RMZ) today.
If we didn’t change, and adapt to different cycles, we wouldn’t have produced these kinds of results year after year. As a testa- ment to our ability to adapt, in 1993, we had mostly small malls in small markets. Now let’s fast forward to today.
• Our malls are mostly big, vibrant and in major markets and are more diverse with dining and entertainment options.
• We entered the value business in a major way through our acquisitions of
ii
the Premium Outlets® business and
The Mills® and grew that business through new development and expansions.
• We have actively recycled over $10.0 billion of real estate through the years, from the sale of non-core assets and the spin-off of our smaller malls and strip center business.
• We have expanded profitably in Europe and Asia.
• We have increased our financial where- withal by creating an A rated company with some of the leading credit metrics out there.
These accomplishments give us confidence, and the conviction that, despite the chal- lenges that exist today and every day, we will be able to successfully navigate the ever-changing environment. SPG is not about resting on our laurels, but finding a way to increase the value of our product for consumers and retailers as well as our profitability. Sometimes there is a tug of war, but for the most part they go hand in hand in delivering value to all of our constituencies.
We do have challenges in our industry; some of which I consider cyclical and some of which are structural. The cyclical challenges have included:
• Little wage growth or GDP growth;
• Pent-up demand for durable goods versus non-durable goods;
• Lack of exciting fashion trends in our industry, that must-have product;
• Stronger dollar affecting tourism spending; and
• Demographic trends, including the aging of the baby boomers and Generation X not having the disposable income yet to increase their discretionary spending.
   David Simon
Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer
My belief is that these will pass and lead to a better environment for us but it could take some time for it to kick in. In the meantime, we grind.
Structural changes are somewhat more challenging and that’s where having the right product and people will help us overcome these issues.
• The internet is a force, and unfortunately our physical retailers have chased this with a vengeance, despite the internet sale having much lower margins than their stores due to higher returns, free shipping costs and high customer acquisition costs. Many times they have allocated too much capital to technology, with little return to show for it, and have not upgraded their stores or service environment.
• We have too much retail per capita in the U.S. Some of it will become obsolete,
and though we have little exposure to this, the industry will feel the pain and this feeds the narrative.
 
2016 ANNUAL REPORT
 • Leveraged balance sheets for many retailers need to be restructured so they have the capital for investment. This
will be a process, which we have seen before, but it will require our expertise to sort through.
• Department stores and many retailers need to bring back excitement, service and a quality store to attract consumers and put at least as much energy behind this effort as they do the internet.
Though we could be intimidated by some of these cyclical and structural challenges, we have the conviction that our business will continue to prosper. The mall product
will diversify away from just apparel,
by increasing its mix and diversity with more mixed-use components (e.g. hotel, residential, etc.), entertainment, food & beverage and wellness. As evidence of this, we have added over 3,000 hotel and residential units to our portfolio in the
last few years. The mall will become less department store focused and consumers will gravitate to the trade areas’ best assets with the most critical mass and diversity of mix, and they will become
the place to shop and be entertained.
We believe in the motto “live, work and play” and our locations can be the hub
for those activities.
  Brickell City Centre, Miami, FL
 Many industries have faced challenges and prospered and I don’t see any reason why well-located, high-quality retail real estate that has a diverse product mix, that is well leased and managed, provides services and looks and feels good, won’t continue to increase in value. Don’t fall for edicts. Remember, in the Great Recession, the belief was that car sales would stay at 10, 11 million units a year and no one would buy SUVs or trucks again. Well, last year more than 17 million units were sold and more than 50% of new sales were SUVs and trucks. Oh well, so much for conventional thinking.
As a reminder, it is important to understand our long-term strategy, which includes:
• Focus on the ownership of high-quality retail real estate;
• Own assets along the price spectrum of retail real estate;
• Enhance the shopping experience through innovations and investments in the “Mall of the Future” and establish a direct relationship with our shopper;
• Lead the industry in successful and profitable acquisitions;
• Export our “know-how” internationally; and
• Accomplish all of this while maintaining a high investment-grade rating and access to multiple forms of capital.
And let me also provide our checklist on how we grow our earnings:
• We increase the cash flow from our existing assets through growth in our comparable property NOI;
• We enhance our existing assets through redevelopment and expansion projects, including adding mixed-use elements, that provide accretive returns while satisfying shopper needs and wants;
• We invest in new developments that meet our stringent investment criteria where the market will support another shopping destination;
• We make accretive acquisitions of exist- ing centers or portfolios of assets where Simon can add value;
• We expand our global footprint through international investments where we can export Simon know-how;
• We make other accretive, strategic investments that will enhance our franchise; and
• We manage our balance sheet and the excess cash flow that comes from our operations.
Before we turn to our 2016 highlights, let’s focus on our stock performance in 2016. Our stock performed well for the first nine months of the year, until interest rates
 iii
 
SIMON PROPERTY GROUP, INC.
 started to rise in the last 90 days of the year. However, it is important to remember that rising interest rates are also a signal
of economic growth and inflation, which can result in increased revenues and sales productivity, all of which are good for strong real estate assets, particularly for Simon which owns a high-quality portfolio in an industry with limited new supply. Clearly, we were disappointed that our stock under- performed the S&P 500 for the year given the continued strength of our earnings, cash flow and industry-leading financial position. This is unusual for us and, in fact, we have outperformed the S&P 500 14 times in
the last 17 years. Despite this one-year stock performance, we will not waver from our strategy that continues to produce industry-leading results year after year. Let’s keep in perspective that we have achieved a compound annual growth rate of more than 13% over the last five years for both our FFO and dividends per share.
With that backdrop, let’s turn to the 2016 highlights.
2016 Financial and
Operational Highlights
We achieved record results in 2016, including:
• Consolidated revenue increased 3.2% to $5.435 billion.
• Net income was $1.836 billion, or $5.87 per diluted share.
• FFO increased to $3.793 billion, or $10.49 per diluted share.
  We once again delivered strong financial and operational results:
• Our total portfolio NOI grew 6.7%, or more than $380 million year-over-year.
• Comparable property NOI grew 3.6% for our U.S. Malls, Premium Outlets and The Mills.
• Occupancy for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets ended the year near an all-time high at 96.8%. The Mills occupancy ended the year at 98.4%.
We faced some operating challenges during the year, including the continued impact of the strong U.S. dollar on tenant sales at a number of our tourist-oriented centers. Despite these challenges, and a slow-growth U.S. economy, we continued to operate our portfolio very efficiently and grew our comparable property cash flow well above national gross domestic product growth. These results are certainly contrary to the public narrative regarding the demise of retail real estate.
Investing In Our Product
Across the country, Simon centers have established themselves as gathering places in their local community, where consumers can shop, dine and make memories together. Our primary focus continues to be investments in our physical product to enhance the shopping experience. Over the past five years,
we have invested more than $5.0 bil- lion in redevelopment and new devel- opment projects and expect to invest
approximately $1.0 billion per year in 2017 and 2018. These investments start with the aesthetic and functional appeal of our centers and extend to on-site cus- tomer service and technology to make the mall shopping experience easier and more efficient for both our shoppers and our retailers.
Achieving the right retail mix is essential to the shopping experience and includes an unmatched focus on providing enhanced dining experiences. “Savor” is a branded dining experience we are adding to a num- ber of our centers. Savor offers a carefully curated collection of eclectic eateries in an exceptional social ambiance integrated with a media center, customer lounge and an amenity center for children and families. Each property is thoroughly reviewed by seasoned professionals to determine the appropriate amenities and mix that will enhance its position in the marketplace.
Redevelopments
and Expansions
Redevelopment and expansion projects that include improvements such as additional retail space, upgraded dining pavilions, technology, parking, and other amenities are ongoing across our portfolio.
2016 was a very busy year, with the comple- tion of a number of notable redevelopment and expansion projects, including a multi- year transformation at King of Prussia, the East Coast’s largest shopping center. This extraordinary project involved an enclosed expansion connecting The Plaza and The
 Luxury influencer event at The Galleria (Houston) hosted by Simon and Vogue
   iv
The Webster at The Galleria, Houston, TX
    
 Court. These two retail areas at King of Prussia had been separated by a roadway since the initial construction of The Court, more than 35 years ago. By connecting these two centers, we added more than 150,000 square feet of exceptional retail and restaurant space, further elevating this landmark property. At Stanford Shopping Center, Palo Alto, California’s beloved shopping destination, we completed a comprehensive transformation. As part
of this transformation, we relocated a Bloomingdale’s within the center into a new 120,000 square foot store and demolished the former location, replacing it with a roster of 50 new retailers and restaurants exclusive to the area. In addition to the well-curated mix of retailers and dining options available at the center, visitors can stroll the beautiful gardens, relax on the lawn and enjoy the plaza during special events held at the center. We also com- pleted significant redevelopments at other market leading centers including The Fashion Centre at Pentagon City in the Washington D.C. area, where we added outward facing shops and restaurants.
We have been very successful at convert- ing former anchors and department stores into more productive retail, dining and entertainment options. At La Plaza Mall
in McAllen, Texas, we acquired a former department store and demolished it, paving the way for a 221,000 square
foot expansion of this retail hub in the
Rio Grande Valley. The newly constructed wing will accommodate several new- to-market specialty shops and new
 restaurants. It is creative repurposes like converting former department store spaces that enable us to accommodate new cutting-edge tenants who are looking to either launch their brands or grow their operations as a result of the significant traffic they experience by being at our highly productive properties. Over the past 15 years, we have success- fully repurposed more than 90 anchor department stores into more productive uses, adding several hundred new retailers and restaurants. The repurposing of anchor department stores will continue to be a significant opportunity for us to add more impactful uses creating even more reasons for consumers to visit our centers and,
in turn, increasing the productivity of our real estate.
Redevelopment and expansion proj-
ects are also underway at several of our high-performing Premium Outlets. We expect to complete the redevelopment and expansion of Woodbury Common Premium Outlets located in Central Valley (New York City), New York this summer. This multi-year expansion further elevates Woodbury’s position as one of the largest and most productive outlet centers in the world and one of New York State’s leading tourist attractions. We also started con- struction on significant expansion projects at Toronto Premium Outlets and Allen Premium Outlets, one of North Texas’ pre- mier shopping destinations. The dramatic expansion at Allen Premium Outlets is expected to include an estimated 30 new specialty retailers that will be added to the
 heart of the center. The existing center will also be redeveloped with new features and amenities including updated seating, a new play area, landscaping and architectural adornments to match the new structures.
We also continued to identify enhance- ment projects in The Mills portfolio. We have a number of redevelopment projects underway at The Mills, including the addition of restaurants and unique enter- tainment offerings, such as the first mall location for a Madame Tussauds at Opry Mills in Nashville, Tennessee. We com- pleted expansions at two key Southern California centers: an 80,000 square foot expansion of Ontario Mills in Riverside, California, and a 60,000 square foot expansion of The Outlets at Orange in Orange (Los Angeles), California.
In addition to our accretive retail rede- velopments, we also continue to identify selective densification opportunities where we add mixed-use components, such as hotels or multi-family residential, to our properties. Over the last several years,
we have added 10 hotels and residenc- es representing more than 3,000 units to some of our major market locations. These additions not only make our prop- erties hubs of retail, dining and entertain- ment, but also places where consumers want to live and visit.
These and other redevelopment projects serve to meet the needs of our shoppers and enhance our real estate. At the end of 2016, we had redevelopment and expansion projects underway at 29 properties in the U.S., Canada and Europe with an investment of approximately $1.1 billion. We expect another very busy and rewarding year as these projects are completed. We continue to anticipate a healthy pipeline of rede- velopment and expansion opportunities for the next few years and expect to fund these future growth opportunities accre- tively with our excess annual cash flow.
New Development
During the year, we opened three new centers—  t  wo outlets and one full-price retail center. Our share of the development costs of these centers was approximately $300 million. In June, we opened an upscale outlet center in Columbus, Ohio and in October, we opened Clarksburg Premium Outlets in Clarksburg, Maryland, serving the greater Washington D.C. area. The debut of Clarksburg Premium Outlets was one of the most successful grand openings of an outlet center we have ever experienced. We finished the year with the opening of Brickell City Centre in vibrant downtown Miami in November. Anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue, Brickell City Centre is a distinctive, open-air, mixed-use center that offers unparalleled shopping, dining and entertainment

 experiences to its visitors.
We currently have one new Premium Outlet Center and one new full-price center under construction in the U.S. We expect to open Norfolk Premium Outlets, in Norfolk, Virginia, this summer and The Shops at Clearfork in Fort Worth, Texas, this fall. Anchored by a new, state-of-the-art Neiman Marcus, The Shops at Clearfork
is an open-air center which will include 100 specialty stores, a premium theater, and distinctive entertainment and restau- rant offerings.
Acquisitions
We continue to source impactful acqui- sitions in the marketplace that further increase the quality, scale and profitability of our portfolio. In 2016, with our part-
ner Invesco Real Estate, we acquired The Shops at Crystals, a stunning retail center at the entryway of CityCenter in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, for approximately $1.1 billion. The Shops at Crystals is a unique retail environment that offers upside through our asset and property man- agement capabilities. We are pleased to expand our presence on the Las Vegas Strip with the addition of The Shops at Crystals to our portfolio, and we look forward to building upon the successful foundation of this high-quality asset.
International
Expanding our international business has been a very important component to our long-term growth strategy and further strengthens our relationship with global retailers.
Our global footprint continues to grow through our Premium Outlets branded centers. During the year, we started con- struction on three new Premium Outlet Centers expanding our presence in Asia and Canada. In Asia, we expect to open both Genting Highlands Premium Outlets in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Siheung Premium Outlets in Siheung (15 miles southwest of Seoul), South Korea, in the second quarter. Genting Highlands will be our second center in Malaysia and Siheung will be our fourth center in South Korea. We are under construction with the Premium Outlet Collection at Edmonton International Airport with our partner Ivanhoe Cambridge. This will be our fourth outlet center in Canada when it opens next year.
We acquired a majority interest in a leading outlet center in Germany with our partner McArthurGlen Group (“MGE”). This successful center is well-positioned within the market and has significant, value-add expansion opportunities available. The MGE partnership also completed a 67,000 square foot expansion of Noventa di Piave Designer Outlet in Venice, Italy, one of
vi
   Europe’s most successful designer outlets. We also look forward to the completion of the new Provence Designer Outlet under construction in Miramas (Provence), France. When it opens this spring, it will be the only designer outlet in the South
of France. With four new international centers under construction, and several expansion projects underway, we continue to find ways to accretively deploy our capital in international markets.
Our investment in Klépierre continues to grow in value as the company executes on their transformation strategy as a leading pan-European pure play retail property company. As Chairman of the Supervisory Board, I am pleased with the continued improvements the company has made
in their operations. In fact, 2016 marked Klépierre’s best operating performance since our involvement with the company began in 2012. With the successful trans- formation of the company’s operations over the last four years, the Supervisory Board decided it was the appropriate time for Jean-Marc Jestin to become Klépierre’s next CEO. I look forward to working with Jean-Marc as he leads
the implementation of the company’s go-forward strategies. Including dividends and the increase in Klépierre’s share price, we have generated a nearly 30% return on our investment.
2016 Balance Sheet
We have the strongest balance sheet in our industry. Our financial flexibility and access to capital enable us to execute our long-term strategy and grow our business. We have the highest investment grade ratings among U.S. retail real estate com- panies and we remain one of only two U.S. REITs with an “A”, “A2” stable outlook credit rating from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, respectively.
We continued to demonstrate balance sheet leadership in 2016 with the issuance of three senior notes offerings, two in
U.S. dollars and the other in Euros, totaling $3.8 billion at a weighted average interest rate of 2.86% and a weighted average term of 11.4 years. We were also active in the secured debt markets as we completed 27 mortgage loans totaling approximately $4.3 billion, of which our share was $3.0 billion. The weighted average interest rate on these loans was 3.67% and the weight- ed average term was 9.4 years. The $3.8 billion in senior unsecured notes and the $3.0 billion of mortgages were both record amounts issued in a single year for us. We have reduced the weighted average interest rate of our debt from 5.24% at the begin- ning of 2012 to 3.53% at the end of 2016.
Personalized
Shopping Experience
Increasingly, consumers expect more per- sonalized experiences from brands and it’s important for us to help deliver the right message at the right time through the right channel to better meet consumers’ needs. Simon is responding by investing in our shoppers and driving the right engagement with them before, during and after they visit our centers. Each engagement is an oppor- tunity to better serve our shoppers, creating the kind of exceptional, elevated experience that builds loyalty and drives return visits.
We are also using technology to better serve our shoppers while they are on property. We have significantly elevated the digital customer experience across
a multitude of different channels and touchpoints including digital advertising, social media engagement, mall mapping and navigation, parking displays to better locate open parking spaces and other cutting-edge technology. All of our digital initiatives are designed to create world-class, compelling experiences that enhance awareness and result in increasing visits
to our centers.

Returning Capital
to Stockholders
For 2016, our capital returned to stock- holders totaled more than $2.6 billion, comprising $2.4 billion in dividends and $255 million in share buybacks. Our dividend policy is to pay dividends to our stockholders equal to our taxable income. Given our expected growth in taxable income, we expect to continue to grow our dividends. We paid common stock dividends in 2016 of $6.50 per share,
an increase of 7.4% from 2015, and we expect to distribute at least $7.00 per share in 2017. Our dividend per share has increased more than 13% on a compound annual basis over the last five years.
  In addition to the dividend paid in 2016, we also repurchased 1.4 million shares of our common stock under our common stock repurchase program. Since your Board of Directors authorized the stock repurchase program in 2015, we have repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares for approx- imately $600 million. Earlier this year, your Board of Directors authorized the extension of our $2 billion common stock repurchase program through March 2019. We will continue to take advantage of market imperfections as it relates to our stock price through this program.
2017 Focus
As I said in 2016, and in my other share- holder letters, we are committed to
our long-term strategy and that will not change this year. We also continue to manage each of our assets as if it is our only asset. Our country needs real growth and SPG will do its share by investing in
its product by roughly $1 billion this year. This investment will provide an enhanced experience for the consumer, the retailer and the community. We are committed and we have the conviction in what we do. We will continue to be innovative, creating memorable, unique experiences for shoppers and retailers alike. Our sound financial status will enable us to invest in the future. We will also make selective dis- positions of those assets that do not meet our expected long-term growth. I am optimistic that we will continue to produce impressive financial results.
I would like to thank our Board of Directors for their contributions in 2016. I also want to thank our beloved director of 15 years, Mel Bergstein, who passed away last year. Our prayers go out to his family. I continue to be proud of our people and what they do every year. Thank you for your loyalty, dedication and hard work. This year will be challenging, but each and every one
of our Simon strong colleagues will make a difference. We will not be deterred by the noise and recent stock performance. Frankly, in my opinion, Simon is a very attractive investment today as it is currently trading at a 15-times FFO multiple—  n  ear historicallows—  a  nda4%dividendyield, compared to the S&P 500 index trading at over an 18-times multiple and only a 1.9% dividend yield.
Finally, I also thank you, our stockholders, for your continued support. Your com- ments and thoughts are always welcome and appreciated.
