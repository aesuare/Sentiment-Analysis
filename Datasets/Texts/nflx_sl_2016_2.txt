July 18, 2016    Fellow shareholders,    We grew by 1.7m members in Q2 finishing with over 83 million members. This is below our forecast of  2.5m net new members and our prior year Q2 net additions of 3.3m. We are growing, but not as fast  as we would like or have been. Disrupting a big market can be bumpy, but the opportunity ahead is as  big as ever and we continue to improve every aspect of our business.

Q2 Results and Q3 Forecast 
Our global member forecast for Q2 was 2.5m and we came in at 1.7m. Gross additions were on target,  but churn ticked up slightly and unexpectedly, coincident with the  press coverage  in early April of our  plan to ungrandfather longer tenured members and remained elevated through the quarter.  We  think some members perceived the news as an impending new price increase rather than the  completion of two years of grandfathering. Churn of members who were actually ungrandfathered is  modest and conforms to our expectations. With our large subscriber base, slight variances in  retention versus forecast can result in significant swings in net adds, particularly in a seasonally small  net add quarter like Q2.    While ungrandfathering and associated media coverage may moderate nearterm membership  growth, we believe that ungrandfathering will provide us with more revenue to invest in our content  to satisfy members, thus driving longterm growth. Over the second half of this year, we'll complete  ungrandfathering. Our threetier pricing (in the US: $7.99 SD, $9.99 HD, and $11.99 UHD) is working  well for us and for new members, and our gross additions remain healthy.    On earnings, we slightly underforecast the quarter, ending Q2 with operating income of $70 million  and net income of $41 million against a forecast of $47 million and $9 million with the variance largely  due to lowerthanexpected content and other costs.   As a reminder, the quarterly guidance we provide is our actual internal forecast at the time we report  and our goal is to be accurate, not conservative. Therefore, in some quarters, we may come in high  versus our forecast and, in other quarters, we may come in low.   In the US, our Q2 net additions were 0.16 million against a forecast of 0.50 million. US revenue rose  18% year over year with domestic ASP growing 4.5% year over year.  As expected, US contribution  margin at 34.3% expanded more moderately year over year, owing to the timing of content spend. In  addition, marketing expenses rose sequentially in support of our growing slate of originals and  business partnerships, which we expect to continue.   As Internet TV rises in popularity, so do the SVOD offerings.  In the US, for example, CBS All Access,  Seeso, Amazon Prime Video, Hulu, YouTube Red, and many others are all growing. Our view, however,  is that we are all growing primarily against linear TV hours and that competition did not contribute  materially to our miss in Q2. First, increased competition would show up mostly in soft gross additions  rather than churn. Second, we experienced a similar uptick in churn in early April in Canada, where  there has been no recent increase in SVOD competition but where ungrandfathering is also  underway.   Similarly, we don't believe market saturation is a key factor in the US given that we experienced  similar performance over the same period in multiple countries with differing levels of Netflix market  penetration.

Our global membership forecast for Q3 includes an impact from the spectacle of the Olympics, on par  with what we experienced four years ago, and does not include any boost in the US from the Comcast  X1 launch due to uncertainty on timing as we and Comcast will only release Netflix on the X1 when  the viewer experience is great.    For Q3, we forecast US net adds of 0.3 million as ungrandfathering continues. We expect US  contribution margin to improve year over year in both Q3 and Q4 and we anticipate meeting our 40%  US contribution margin target by 2020, or even earlier.    International net additions in Q2 came to 1.5 million compared to our 2.0 million forecast.  Ungrandfathering occurred in Canada, UK/Ireland, Latin America, and the Nordics during Q2 where,  like the US, we saw a similar, earlierthanexpected impact on retention. In our newer markets, we  continue to learn and believe that growth will unfold over a multiyear period, similar to our  experience in Latin America.   International revenue rose 67% year over year. Excluding the impact of F/X ($37 million impact on a  y/y basis), international ASP increased 8.7%. International contribution profit totaled $69 million as  content spending was slightly lower than our forecast.  For Q3, we expect international net additions of 2.0m. Our approach in expanding our global footprint  in January was to launch a service targeting early adopters and then to listen, learn and iterate  quickly. Now that we are six months in, we will localize Netflix in Poland and Turkey with the addition  of local language in the user interface, subtitles and dubbing. Localization in other markets will take  place over time as economically prudent.   International contribution loss in Q3 is expected to be $95 million as improving profitability in our  earlier foreign markets funds the investment in newer international territories. We remain confident  in these investments because of our success in all of the markets launched prior to 2014 which are  individually profitable on a contribution profit basis. These 20102013 launch markets are on track to  deliver  aggregate contribution profit of around $500 million in 2016.  Prior to the global launch of our service in January, Netflix was available in 60 countries. In these  earlier expansion markets, our adoption rate in the first several months (as measured by penetration  of broadband households) has been highly varied and the initial uptake is not necessarily indicative of  our longterm penetration. We have already achieved success (contribution profits) in many types of  markets including those where English is not the main language (e.g. Chile); that have low pay TV  penetration (e.g. Australia); that have historically had high levels of piracy (e.g. Nordics); that have  payment or broadband infrastructure challenges (e.g. Mexico with payments and Canada with low  data caps); that have big competition (e.g. UK); that have low disposable income (e.g. Brazil); or that  have many of these factors (e.g. most of Latin America).

Unfortunately, this year the regulatory climate in China for our service has become more challenging.  Disney's streaming service, launched in conjunction with Alibaba, was closed down, as was Apple's  movie offering. We continue to explore options and, in the meantime, have plenty of work to do in  our newly opened markets.   Our global expansion is an exciting opportunity that will unfold over many years. Continued US  growth will be a part of it and there is no change to our view that in the US Netflix can reach 6090  million members. We continue to expect to run around breakeven on a net income basis in 2016 and  to generate material profits in 2017 and beyond. We will drive operating profit growth in 2017 by  reducing our international losses and continuing to grow US profit. 

Content 
In Q2, we continued to expand the pace and breadth of original series, films and documentaries  released on Netflix, including the 4th season of  Orange is the New Black  and the second of our Adam  Sandler films,  The Do Over ,  which, at launch, was the number one mostwatched film on Netflix in  every territory of the world and remains in the top 10 in many countries, including the US.  The substantial viewing of our growing  slate of originals  around the world is a testament to how well  high quality Englishlanguage TV travels. Local content constitutes a small minority of total viewing in  our international segment. We do not plan on trying to outcompete local TV networks in local content  in every nation of the world. Rather, we selectively complement our service with licensed and original  local content. We are developing nonEnglish language original series and films in more than a dozen  countries including Brazil, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, South Korea, Argentina and  Spain when we find compelling, high quality projects with attractive economics and a potentially large  audience around the world.  Narcos , only partially in English, is an early success in this area.    We are also pleased with the critical acclaim received by our original programming. Last week, 17 of  our original series, documentaries, films and comedy specials received 54 Primetime Emmy  nominations, up from 34 last year. Netflix saw the largest increase in nominations among networks  and has  the third most total nominations of any domestic network  (behind only FX and HBO). Earlier,  nine of our kids' shows received 33 Daytime Emmy nominations, more than any other network. We  have made good progress since launching our first original series  Lilyhammer  in 2012.   While ramping up originals, we are also actively acquiring high quality, licensed content. We've  extended our licensing agreement with The CW Network, making Netflix the US SVOD home for prior  seasons of all scripted series broadcast on The CW beginning with the 20152016 TV season. Netflix  members will be able to stream full seasons of programs like  Legends of Tomorrow ,  Supergirl ,  Arrow  and  The Flash ,  just eight days after each season finale.  Next year, Netflix will also be the exclusive  home of the new  Star Trek  series from CBS outside the US and Canada, with new episodes arriving in  188 countries within 24 hours of their North American premiere.

Marketing 
We primarily market our originals to drive member acquisition. Building off that, this past quarter we  began testing the availability of select episodes of a few of our original shows on linear television in  partnership with broadcasters. One week after its premiere on Netflix, the first two episodes of our  first French original series,  Marseille , aired on French broadcast network TF1. Season one episodes  (but not season two) of  Narcos  and  Club de Cuervos  will air on Univision and Unimas, respectively, in  the US. Through these tactics, we're aiming to entice consumers to join Netflix to complete their  binge. The danger is diluting the perception that Netflix original content is only on Netflix, so we are  testing cautiously.  

Product and Partnerships 
As we have noted in the past, our global expansion in January means that we are now operating in  some markets where consumers access the Internet primarily through mobile devices. This has led us  to invest more in our mobile experience including sign up, authentication, user interface, payments  and streaming efficiency for cellular networks. In Q2, we began testing Google Play inapp payment on  Android devices, which we think will aid our ability to acquire new customers in many international  markets, as our iOS inapp payments have done.    To date, we have partnered with over 40 MVPDs across the world to make it easier for consumers to  enjoy and pay for Netflix, to grow awareness of our service in certain markets and to reach different  demographic segments. In the US, we are excited that Netflix will be available on the Comcast X1  settop box later this year.  

Strong Net Neutrality 
We continue to make progress with Open Connect, and the approval of the Charter/TWC merger with  a seven year condition of settlementfree interconnect is a helpful precedent. When ISPs around the  world agree to take our Open Connect servers in or near their networks for free, they see reductions  in their network costs, and as a result, the program has continued to grow in popularity.   

Competition 
Our goal remains to win as many "moments of truth" as we can. Given all the leisure activities  consumers can engage in  reading a book, playing videogames, watching a sports match, etc.  we  compete with a very broad set of alternatives. Our focus is to improve Netflix every day across  multiple dimensions including content, streaming quality, device footprint, payment options, and  more. If we can do that, we believe we have ample room to grow.  There are an increasing number of virtual MVPDs, like Sony Vue, DISH's Sling TV, Amazon's Streaming  Partners Program, and Hulu's  forthcoming service , which offer a smaller bundle of TV channels at a  lower cost per month. To the degree these services provide an improved MVPD experience or spur  improvement amongst incumbent MVPDs to become more Internetcentric (ondemand,  multiscreen, personalized), they will become increased competition for entertainment time.

In the most recent Sandvine report, our share of North American Internet traffic was 35%. As we  referenced in our  Q4 '15 letter  in January, our implementation of more efficient encoding would  reduce our results in the Sandvine report, which measures peak megabits, not peak viewing hours.  

 

Free Cash Flow and Capital Structure 
In Q2'16, free cash flow amounted to $254 million, compared with $261 million in Q1'16. We  finished the quarter with cash and equivalents of $1.8 billion, while gross debt was unchanged at $2.4  billion. We still plan to raise additional capital through the high yield market later in 2016/early 2017.   Our capital requirements continue to be driven by our investment in original content, particularly  programming that we produce, which requires more cash upfront relative to licensed content.  Original content provides Netflix with many benefits: new programming that debuts on Netflix,  exclusivity, greater creative and business control, global rights and brand halo. These merits outweigh  the timing of cash payments.   Our choice to fund these requirements through debt rather than equity is based on our desire to  optimize our capital structure to yield the lowest possible weighted average cost of capital. Given our  low debt to total capital ratio, the after tax cost of debt is currently more attractive than equity.     

DVD 
We finished Q2'16 with 4.5 million DVD members in the US, and contribution profit of $71 million.

Summary 
While we did not grow as fast as forecast in Q2, we are optimistic about the future owing to our  singular focus, global scale and the growth of Internet TV viewing. We are in the very early days of the  shift from linear television to ondemand viewing and there are nearly 1 billion pay TV subscribers  worldwide who will migrate to Internet TV over the coming decades.     On a personal note, this week we release season three of  Bojack Horseman   since you all follow the  media business, this is a series you may love as much as we do.

Use of NonGAAP Measures
This shareholder letter and its attachments include reference to the nonGAAP financial measure of  net income on a pro forma basis excluding the r elease of tax reserves , and to free cash flow and  EBITDA.  Management believes that the nonGAAP measure of net income on a pro forma basis  excluding the release of tax reserves provides useful information as this measure excludes effects that  are not indicative of our core operating results. Management believes that free cash flow and EBITDA  are important liquidity metrics because they measure, during a given period, the amount of cash  generated that is available to repay debt obligations, make investments and for certain other activities  or the amount of cash used in operations, including investments in global streaming content.  However, these nonGAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or  superior to, net income, operating income, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by  operating activities, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliation to  the GAAP equivalent of these nonGAAP measures are contained in tabular form on the attached  unaudited financial statements.   

ForwardLooking Statements
This shareholder letter contains certain forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the federal  securities laws, including statements regarding impacts on subscriber growth and revenue arising  from ungrandfathering; marketing expense in support of originals and partnerships; growth of

Internet TV; impacts on our business from competition; US growth, contribution margin and  longterm subscriber numbers; international growth, net additions and contribution loss; localization  efforts; profitability in 2017 and beyond; content strategy, including local content, original and  licensed content investments; future capital raises and timing of such raises; forecasts for domestic  and international net, total and paid subscribers; revenue; contribution profit (loss) and contribution  margin for both domestic (streaming and DVD) and international operations, as well as consolidated  operating income, net income, earnings per share and free cash flow. The forwardlooking statements  in this letter are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ,  including, without limitation: our ability to attract new members and retain existing members; our  ability to compete effectively; maintenance and expansion of device platforms for streaming;  fluctuations in consumer usage of our service; service disruptions; production risks; actions of Internet  Service Providers; and, competition, including consumer adoption of different modes of viewing  inhome filmed entertainment.  A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that  could cause actual results and events to differ materially from such forwardlooking statements is  included in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on  Form 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 28, 2016.  The Company  provides internal forecast numbers.
