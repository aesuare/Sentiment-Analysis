Dear fellow shareholders, The economic and market environment has continued to present the marketplace with a steady series of challenges. The U.S. and other economies have struggled to gain solid footing. Interest rates remain at historic lows, limiting investment income. And while equity markets have rebounded to pre-crisis levels, significant fiscal hurdles remain and investor unease persists. At Ameriprise Financial, we're navigating this business environment with the knowledge and perspective we've gained over a century. In the face of headwinds, we're generating solid results, continuing to invest in our company and, as always, remaining steadfast in serving our clients. We are a diversified financial services firm with a deep heritage in financial planning and advice and leadership positions in advisory, asset management, annuities and protection. We take a long-term, comprehensive approach to serving our clients' financial needs. At year end, total assets under management and administration reached $681 billion. And as important, we continue to differentiate Ameriprise by the strength of our capital generation and the flexibility of our financial foundation. As I review our 2012 results along with the opportunities before us, I am confident that we are well positioned to continue our progress.

James M. Cracchiolo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

Ameriprise is differentiated by our financial strength and ability to generate and redeploy capital. We're executing our strategy and transforming our earnings mix, which results in greater capital flexibility to return to shareholders and invest for growth -- all while maintaining a strong excess capital position.

Large opportunity for Ameriprise
Significant trends are shaping and redefining the global financial services marketplace: ·The large opportunity to serve the needs of the mass affluent and affluent and the transition of the U.S. baby boomer population to retirement, and ·The expanding global asset management opportunity. Our target market in the U.S. is the mass affluent and affluent. This group holds more than half of the nation's $26 trillion in total investable assets. Every day, 10,000 baby boomers reach age 65 and will continue to do so for the next 10 years. This is an astonishing number; the baby boomer generation has and will continue to transform the U.S. financial services marketplace into the future. Companies that succeed in serving this core group need to not only help grow clients' wealth, but also help them manage and protect their assets and income as they transition to what could be more than 30 years in retirement. For many of our clients, achieving a confident retirement is their top financial goal. In fact, I believe our comprehensive approach to advising, managing and protecting the assets and income of our clients is among the best in the industry.

Powerful, branded retail financial services provider
Ameriprise is built on the relationships our more than 9,700 financial advisors have developed with more than 2 million individuals and small business owners in the U.S. We're the leading financial planning company in the country and each component of our business helps strengthen those relationships while also helping to preserve and grow client assets over time. Our advisor force -- the fifth largest branded advisor force in the U.S. -- is a powerful platform. Over the past several years, we've made significant investments in the business, including strengthening the Ameriprise Financial brand, enhancing our product and technology infrastructure and recruiting experienced advisors to Ameriprise. The result has been solid growth in our core client base, record client asset and advisor productivity levels, as well as steady improvement in the earnings and profitability of our advisory business.

The Ameriprise brand is trusted and relevant. Our MORE WITHIN REACH® brand platform conveys the personal nature of how we serve clients and the underlying strength of our firm. Our advertising has helped define who we are and what we do. We're building on this momentum with new television and online advertising featuring award-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones; it captures the American spirit and demonstrates how we're helping our clients feel more confident about their retirement. In 2012, we completed the multi-year installation of our new brokerage platform -- successfully converting our entire advisor force to the system. It was one of the most complex and significant technology projects we've executed since our spin-off in 2005, requiring strong coordination across the company. We also added to our Ameriprise® Managed Accounts platform, which provides a broad selection of sophisticated discretionary and non-discretionary solutions for our advisors and clients.

The transformation of our brokerage platform and the enhancements to our product suite are important elements of our ability to recruit experienced advisors to Ameriprise. We offer a compelling proposition to advisors that combines financial strength, a strong brand, dedicated leadership and an entrepreneurial culture. During the year, 382 experienced advisors moved their businesses to Ameriprise, bringing with them billions of dollars of new assets and thousands of client relationships. In fact, over the past several years, approximately 1,000 experienced advisors have joined the firm.

Uniquely positioned to meet clients' needs for income and protection
As clients build wealth and move to retirement, two priorities become paramount: protecting their hard-earned assets from adverse financial impacts and creating income streams throughout retirement. These are complex issues to navigate, but Ameriprise has the tools to help. We are unique in the industry; we develop our life insurance and variable annuity products exclusively for Ameriprise clients -- people we know well. We combine the intellectual capital across our firm with our financial strength and risk management prowess to build product solutions that help to protect wealth, preserve assets and guarantee retirement income.

Guiding clients toward a confident retirement
Ameriprise Financial recognizes the growing need for personalized retirement planning services. Our Confident Retirement® approach offers a framework for advisors and clients to create retirement plans that provide income for a lifetime. It's an example of how we apply our deep understanding of consumers to the solutions, strategies and tools they need to help achieve their retirement goals.

We continued to build on our record of creating advice-embedded solutions, developing a new variable annuity rider in 2012 that incorporates a fund designed to help clients manage exposure to equity market volatility. We also made adjustments to product pricing and features to align with the market environment. Initially, variable annuity sales were slower as we trained our advisors, but we began to see improvement toward the end of the year. Importantly, we design all our annuity products to achieve our targeted risk and return profile -- balancing client benefits with appropriate shareholder returns. We also recently enhanced our life insurance portfolio with our new indexed universal life insurance product and reinvigorated our variable universal life insurance product line. While sales have lagged pre-recession levels, our product enhancements and advisor training are generating improved results. Indexed universal life sales were strong throughout 2012 and sales of our variable universal life insurance began to pick up in the second half of the year. In addition to the life and annuity products we offer our clients, Ameriprise Auto & Home Insurance offers a broad suite of property and casualty products primarily through affinity relationships. Our team has built a great client value proposition, and in 2012, we were able to deliver solid financial results given a difficult storm season that included superstorm Sandy. At the same time, we're growing our policy count steadily and remain focused on delivering the high-quality service people expect from Ameriprise. Combined, our insurance and annuity businesses enhance shareholder value beyond their earnings and return contributions. They enhance asset persistency -- the length of time clients entrust their assets to Ameriprise. Clients who hold life insurance and annuity products have high satisfaction rates. And advisors who meet their clients' full financial needs by incorporating insurance and annuity products have stronger, more valuable practices than advisors who are more transaction oriented.

Asset Management -- a growth opportunity for Ameriprise
Through Columbia Management and Threadneedle Investments, Ameriprise ranks among the world's largest asset managers with $455 billion in assets under management at year end. Columbia primarily serves U.S. investors and is the eighth-largest manager of long-term mutual funds. Threadneedle primarily serves European investors and is the fourth-largest retail fund provider in the U.K.

Ameriprise Financial Annual Report 2012

North America and Europe -- our core markets -- represent approximately 70 percent of the more than $60 trillion in managed assets around the world. While Asia-Pacific, Latin America and other developing regions hold fewer assets, managed assets in these regions are expected to generate higher growth rates in the future. We have consistently invested in our asset management business to position the firm to compete globally. We have a good balance of equity and fixed income assets, broad capabilities and improving distribution. And we have developed important strategic relationships that provide a solid base of assets and earnings. We're building on this strong foundation and the breadth of our investment and research talent to generate consistent, competitive investment performance at both Columbia and Threadneedle. In 2012, our investment performance was recognized with more than 40 Lipper awards across equity and fixed income categories in numerous countries. And at year end, Morningstar rated 111 of our funds four or five stars. Like many firms in the industry, Columbia reported net outflows in 2012. While our underlying flow characteristics were similar to other firms -- retail equity net outflows and net inflows in fixed income funds -- our results also reflected other items that were specific to Columbia, including net outflows in former parent-company portfolios and funds sub-advised by a third-party firm. In addition, the fourth quarter proved to be challenging for Columbia and others in the industry, given investors' concerns about potential tax changes and the U.S. budget impasse. Everyone at Columbia recognizes the need to generate profitable net inflows. While we have more work to do, the underlying business is sound. We have good products with good performance. More key decision-makers in the industry are recommending Columbia funds, and we're working to broaden our product lines to compete more effectively in crucial growth areas, such as multi-asset class solutions and global products. In addition, we've strengthened our institutional business. We're establishing important relationships with industry gatekeepers that will be essential as we grow the business over time. Threadneedle had a strong year, generating net inflows despite ongoing outflows of former-parent insurance assets. The U.K. retail business led the way, as investors gained confidence midway through the year, generating net inflows. In addition, our core institutional

business remains on solid ground. We're earning good mandates in the Middle East, Australia and other key markets and are developing our presence in Asia. Threadneedle also manages an excellent property business, which continues to generate positive results. We have two strong franchises in Columbia and Threadneedle. The post-acquisition work to integrate Columbia is now complete and we are moving forward. We have earned strong positions in our core markets and are working to expand our international presence. And we recognize that we have the opportunity to build a more powerful asset management business by working together -- aligning our talent, resources and capabilities more effectively to present a more unified global offering to the marketplace.

Earnings growth and mix shift
Clearly, the market environment has a significant impact on our results. While rising equity markets increase our asset base, continued low interest rates mute the earnings power of our spread businesses in the near term. And market volatility and investor concerns over fiscal policy dampen client activity. As we serve an increasingly affluent client base and broaden our distribution reach, we're growing the earnings contribution of our key growth businesses: Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. At year end, the results produced from these two businesses represented more than half of our pretax operating earnings, up significantly from only a few years ago. At the same time, we're maintaining our expense discipline and benefiting from our reengineering initiatives -- operating margins for both segments increased from a year ago. We're also generating solid earnings and returns from our Annuity and Protection businesses that are in line with our plans. Given the prospect of interest rates remaining near zero for the foreseeable future, we plan to target specific growth opportunities within the Ameriprise channel. And we will continue to differentiate the businesses from peers by our affiliated distribution model, higher percentage of fee-based revenues and lower exposure to living benefits in our variable annuity business. Importantly, as we orchestrate this shift in our earnings mix to be driven more by our less capital-intensive, fee-based businesses, we're also taking steps to reduce risk through product enhancements

Cash flow strength and capital flexibility
One of the key benefits of our integrated business model and our capital management strategy is our capacity to generate and deploy capital to drive shareholder value. While the economic and market environment will always influence our capital deployment strategy, we believe that the combination of the strength of our balance sheet and the free cash flow we generate provides the opportunity to continue returning a large majority of our annual earnings to shareholders. In 2012, we returned $1.7 billion to shareholders, devoting more than $1.3 billion to share repurchases and increasing our dividends paid per share by 64 percent. At year end, the yield on Ameriprise Financial common stock was about 3 percent, putting us in the top quartile of our peer group. In fact, we expect to maintain a high level of share repurchase activity in 2013 given that we believe our stock remains undervalued and reflecting our commitment to help offset the per-share impact of our decision to transition Ameriprise Bank from a federal savings bank to a non-deposit taking national trust company. With regard to our consolidated financials, our continued focus on expense management and commitment to reengineering helped to offset significant interest rate pressure. On an operating basis in 2012, net revenues were up slightly to $10.1 billion, earnings per diluted share increased 8 percent to $5.59, and our return on equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, increased to a strong 16.2 percent. Investors responded favorably to our performance and the actions we've taken to drive shareholder value. For the year, the total return of Ameriprise Financial common stock was 29.5 percent. Over the past several years, and again this year, we have continued to deliver compelling returns, outpacing the total return of the S&P Financials, S&P Asset Management and S&P Life & Health Insurance indices.

and other actions. As such, we're lowering the capital requirements of the overall business as we generate significant free cash flow, which we can allocate to growth investments and return to shareholders. In fact, in each of the past two years, we've returned more than 130 percent of our operating earnings to shareholders while maintaining more than $2 billion in excess capital.

A commitment to community
Ameriprise is a strong company because of our people. We are committed to fostering a culture of service. This work is underway year round through a platform of strategic philanthropy that engages our advisors and employees in initiatives that are important to them. Our signature event, held every fall, is our National Day of Service. As part of our commitment to help end domestic hunger and in partnership with Feeding America and other hunger-relief organizations, we draw together people from across the company to volunteer to help feed hungry families during the holidays. In 2012, 9,000 Ameriprise volunteers in nearly all 50 states worked to repackage bulk food items, assemble holiday meal packages and stock warehouses. This work benefitted more than 350 hunger-relief organizations throughout the country dedicated to assisting the 50 million Americans -- including 17 million children -- who struggle with hunger. In recognition of our commitment to community, Ameriprise was named one of the country's most civic-minded companies by the National Conference on Citizenship and Points of Light. The Civic 50 is a scientific evaluation ranking companies that best use their time, talent and resources to improve the quality of life where they do business.
