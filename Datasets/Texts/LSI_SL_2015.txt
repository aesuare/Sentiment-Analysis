LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
I am pleased to report that we have achieved substantially all of the objectives we set out to accomplish during the fiscal 2015 "turnaround" phase of LSI Industries and that we are on the road to significant profit improvement and higher sales. More specifically, we added key experienced senior executives to our management team; hired successful talent to muscle-build our sales team; implemented the LSI Business System; and took a wide range of actions to reduce costs, increase manufacturing efficiency, and improve product quality and customer satisfaction. My overall mission is to develop shareholder value through higher sales and earnings, and increased cash dividends as LSI moves forward. We have managed LSI through the critical "turnaround" phase and are now in the "continuous improvement" phase. From the perspective of increasing sales, the markets that we serve are extremely large and we have every opportunity to grow our market share over the coming months and years. We will continue to strengthen our sales and marketing teams as well as our product offerings to ensure that we capture a larger percentage of the available market. From a cost perspective, we will continue to use our LSI Business System to evaluate and manage the cost components of our business. We are confident that we will continue to find opportunities to improve our efficiencies and we believe in a never ending process of continuous improvement to remain competitive in today's market place. LSI is a leader in solid-state lighting and lighting controls. Our LED Lighting business is growing rapidly and we are well positioned with these advanced solid-state products to compete in both the indoor and outdoor LED markets. Operating income in our lighting business increased by 40% this past fiscal year and we see additional opportunities for significant improvement. Our Graphics business is growing again and the division is now profitable. We declare the "Great Recession" that so negatively impacted our Graphics business over the past years to be over. The gross profit in our graphics business increased by 50% during fiscal 2015 and we see additional opportunities for improvement. The transition from printed graphics to digital signage is accelerating and we are in a good position to capture an increasing amount of this business. Digital signage now makes up 8% of our Graphics sales. Our Technology business includes SmartVision® and Lighting Controls, both of which are strategic components. LSI showed early LED technology leadership as our LED drivers included SmartVision® features like: digital control, closed loop feedback of light level and temperature, high wattage applications, and the widest LED drive voltage operating range in the industry. In the LED luminaire itself, we are a leading innovator in reflective optics and maintain a strong patent portfolio and proprietary position. Our Lighting Controls group pioneered a number of SmartVision® advances in outdoor lighting control including: schedule management in the controller, integrated sensors, a patented mesh network system, and mobile apps. Our patented mesh network system was recently installed at the General Dynamics NASSCO shipyard facility in San Diego. We are currently improving our product development process so that we can accelerate the rate of new product introductions in the future. Our LED Lighting business grew by 27% in fiscal 2015, increasing from 45% to nearly 60% of lighting sales in the past 12 months and we expect this trend to continue. Our vitality index (new products introduced in the last 36 months as a percent of total sales) was at 42% in fiscal 2015. We believe we are in tune with the technology changes happening around us and are in a position to capitalize upon those changes. With an eye to the future, Andy Foerster, our Chief Technology Officer, is actively exploring opportunities for LSI within "The Internet of Things." We are quite proud of two prominent image installations that were completed in downtown Cincinnati in advance of the 2015 Major League Baseball (MLB) All Star festivities this summer. We manufactured and installed the new outdoor Video Board at the Cincinnati Red's stadium entrance on the Hall of Fame wall outside Great American Ballpark. We also manufactured and donated new specialty lighting fixtures for the historic Roebling Bridge that spans the Ohio River from Kentucky into downtown Cincinnati. Actively participating as part of the community is important to LSI.

As we create higher profits at LSI, we see investment opportunities not only in equipment, products, and technology, but in our people as well. The LSI Business System is how we train all associates to engage in their workplace and work to eliminate waste and improve processes and efficiencies. Several new additions to our executive management team were made this past year including myself, Andy Foerster, Paul Foster, and John Bagwell. We have integrated well with the existing executives that have many years of experience at LSI and together we are committed to taking LSI Industries to the next level. The LSI Board of Directors and the entire LSI management team want to thank Dave McCauley for his considerable contribution to LSI Industries as he retires after 18 years of service. Dave was one of the original founders of Grady McCauley in North Canton, OH which was acquired by LSI Industries in 1997 and subsequently became the headquarters for the LSI Graphics Division. The LSI Graphics Division continues to be one of the largest graphics and image companies in the country thanks to Dave's leadership. I would be remiss if I didn't pause to offer a tribute to LSI's founder, the late Robert J. Ready. Bob operated the business with a passion, and guided the growth of the company for nearly four decades. In addition, I want to personally offer a sincere thank you to our customers, employees, sales representative agencies, suppliers, and directors for their support and contributions to make fiscal 2015 a successful "turnaround" year. Sales and profit growth are off to a strong start early in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, and I look forward to reporting solid and measurable improvements as the year progresses. From a strategic standpoint, our priority focus is to demonstrate to customers how LSI can be their value-added, trusted partner in developing superior image solutions through our world-class lighting, graphics, and technology capabilities. Image is fundamental to our growth strategy. Respectfully,

Dennis W. Wells President and Chief Executive Officer Director
