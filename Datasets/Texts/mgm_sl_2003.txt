2003 WAS A YEAR OF TREMENDOUS FOCUS AT MGM MIRAGE. OUR BUSINESS FUNDAMENTALS WERE SOLID, AND OUR RESULTS WERE ON TARGET.

TO OUR

SHAREHOLDERS

Throughout our lives, we've all received the same advice in different ways ­ stay the course; keep your nose to the grindstone; bear down. It all comes down to staying focused. While it may seem good advice for life in general, we at MGM MIRAGE firmly believe that staying focused has been a key element of our success. Staying focused is, in fact, one of the most fundamental elements of success in any business. During 2003, the concentration and hard work of your management team and the 40,000 employees of MGM MIRAGE has created unrivaled opportunities by providing the necessary foundation upon which we continue to build your Company's future. Over the past year, we devoted our energies and resources to solidifying our hard-earned reputation for quality ­ a reputation that is central to our business plan. To that end, we added new amenities and attractions at each of our properties ­ new restaurants, shows, guest rooms, nightclubs and lounges were designed to awe our first time guests and inspire our devoted long-time customers. This hard work and dedication is clearly reflected in our financial results. In 2003, we produced record net revenues of $3.9 billion - up 3% from levels achieved in 2002, while our net income was $244 million. MGM MIRAGE is also focused on identifying the most promising possibilities for growth in the U.S. and around the world. The gaming market in

FOCUS IN EVERY ASPECT OF OUR BUSINESS WITH AN EYE ON THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND ATTENTION TO EVERY DETAIL.
As the most admired company in the gaming industry, MGM MIRAGE willingly accepts the privilege of leadership and the responsibilities that come with that honor. Taking the leading role within the gaming industry on important issues such as diversity, problem gambling and philanthropy is a role we welcome and embrace. MGM MIRAGE fosters relationships with local government and business interests, and community-based cultural organizations such as the United States Hispanic Chamber With our country involved in military action, we provide full pay and benefits for our employees on military leave. This reflects the commitment our company has not only to our employees, but also to their families, who serve our country. In each case, our unmatched attention to detail and ability to stick to our business plan has resulted in increased shareholder value.

WE HAVE ALWAYS CONCENTRATED ON QUALITY. THE QUALITY OF OUR RESORTS, ENTERTAINMENT AND SERVICE IS UNSURPASSED, SO OUR GUESTS RETURN YEAR AFTER YEAR.

In April, we broke ground on an expansion project at BELLAGIO. Upon completion of the 928-room Spa Tower in December 2004, our guests will enjoy new retail and dining outlets, a completely renovated spa and expanded convention space. We've recently remodeled all of Bellagio's existing standard rooms, meaning every guest will enjoy amenities like marble entries, flat-screen televisions and electronic draperies.

MGM MIRAGE "AMERICA'S MOST ADMIRED GAMING COMPANY" IN ITS ANNUAL SURVEY OF COMPANIES WITH LARGE U.S. OPERATIONS.
And we continue to enhance and upgrade our offerings. Just in the past year, we redefined the travel and leisure experience at several of our resorts. At New York-New York we opened ZUMANITY TM, the latest creation from Cirque du Soleil. This exciting new look at sensuality has already received international acclaim and has taken its place as one of the most popular shows in Las Vegas. MGM Grand celebrated great change in 2003. Among the highlights was the creation of Tabú, a chic and innovative lounge with a new-age sophistication. At Fiamma Trattoria, a stylish outpost of the highly successful Manhattan restaurant, award-winning restaurateur Stephen Hanson brings many of Fiamma Osteria's signature dishes to MGM Grand.

You might say that our management team and employees are fixated on quality. A quick look at the accolades earned by our resorts tells volumes. Bellagio is one of only three AAA Five Diamond-rated resorts in Las Vegas. We operate all three Five Diamond restaurants in Las Vegas ­ Picasso and Le Cirque at Bellagio and Renoir at The Mirage. Several of our other resorts ­ The Mirage, Treasure Island and Beau Rivage ­ are AAA Four Diamond-rated resorts.

NEW ATTRACTIONS

AT TREASURE ISLAND, MGM GRAND AND A NEW CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW AT NEW YORK­NEW YORK PUT MGM MIRAGE IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

Elsewhere, working closely with our partners Boyd Gaming, we celebrated the opening of Borgata in Atlantic City on July 3, 2003. This spectacular new resort has performed exceptionally well in its first six months. The first resort to open in Atlantic City in over 13 years, Borgata is setting a new standard for the market. I want to take a moment to reflect on the remarkable careers of Siegfried & Roy. While their record-breaking performance at The Mirage has come to an end, we have paid a special tribute to them on the inside of the back cover of this year's

report. They are exceptional people who have meant so much to our company, our community and the entertainment industry. While we will miss them as daily performers at The Mirage, we look forward to a long and vibrant relationship with them as they move into a new chapter in their incredible lives. It is with mixed emotions that I note the sale of the Golden Nugget resorts in Las Vegas and Laughlin and the pending sale of MGM Grand Australia. But the proceeds from these sales provide significant resources to further invest in high return growth opportunities.
THE MIRAGE opened a new Polynesian-themed lounge called AVA, which features enticing décor and a cutting-edge bar that offers specialty drinks and signature cocktails.

NEW YORK-NEW YORK, working with the Irish Pub Company, opened NINE FINE IRISHMEN, an authentic Irish pub with most of its interior architecture brought over directly from Ireland.

TREASURE ISLAND marked its tenth anniversary and introduced a new logo and branding campaign for "TI," Treasure Island, and opened the "Sirens of TI" show at the front of the resort.

MGM GRAND completed the rollout of Players Club, the Company's exclusive player rewards program. 2003 also saw the opening of SEABLUE, the latest creation of internationally acclaimed chef Michael Mina. Mina's innovative menu offers "jet fresh" seafood dishes and fresh seasonal produce.

LOOKING FORWARD, WE ARE
FOCUSED ON SPREADING THE MGM MIRAGE QUALITY TO NEW RESORTS AROUND THE WORLD.
And we have begun the process of turning opportunities into reality. Throughout 2003, MGM MIRAGE has been continuously evaluating opportunities for growth. As a result, we have taken several options for strategic investments in the United Kingdom. MGM MIRAGE has quickly established itself as the company most prepared to take advantage of anticipated gaming reforms in the U.K. By entering into well-designed strategic partnerships, MGM MIRAGE stands at the forefront of a new age of gaming in Great Britain. With our long history of experience, commitment to quality and focus on management strength, we believe the opportunity to be great for our company, its shareholders, employees, business partners and new British neighbors. We continued to explore opportunities in Asia, where governments have recently expanded the scope of gaming. For example, Macau has long been one of the most well known gaming destinations in the Far East. It now stands at the threshold of establishing a far broader reputation as one of the world's leading gaming centers. Its location only a few miles from mainland China and Hong Kong and in the heart of Asia makes it the perfect destination for tourists from many Asian nations.

BORGATA, MGM MIRAGE's joint venture with Boyd Gaming, opened in the summer of 2003 as Atlantic City's first new casino resort in 13 years. In its brief history, Borgata has imbued the area with a heightened level of elegance and luxury. It's enormous success has made our adjacent land holdings at Renaissance Point a much more valuable asset.

WE ZERO IN ON THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE WORK AND LIVE BY PROVIDING MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES AND CHANGING LIVES.

In 2003, our focus intensified on making substantive and meaningful change in the lives of our employees and in the communities in which we are privileged to do business. We have the best employees in the industry, because we devote ourselves to pinpointing talented people and developing their leadership qualities. Programs like our partnership with the University of Nevada at Las Vegas Hotel College and our Management Associate Program are designed to prepare recent college graduates for careers in management with MGM MIRAGE.

All of our employees have access to programs which allow them to grow in their careers through programs like REACH!, a leadership development program for employees to further their skills and learn all facets of the supervisory experience through classroom instruction, job shadowing, and mentoring. We also train our employees extensively, offering everything from courses such as ESL (English as a Second Language) classes for employees needing to improve their Englishspeaking skills to advanced customer service training and mentoring programs.

None of these programs would be possible without the complete focus and energy of the Human Resources Council, a group of HR leaders representing the Company's resorts and other entities. These women and men are responsible for the people polices, programs and fostering the wonderful culture of our organization. The subject of problem gambling has taken a much larger role in public discourse in recent years, and MGM MIRAGE is at the forefront of addressing the issue. We were a founding member of the National Center for Responsible Gaming, the single largest source of funding for problem gambling research in the world.

OUR COMMITMENT TO

DIVERSITY...

IN 2002, WE DEVELOPED A PROGRAM THAT ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO BECOME "DIVERSITY CHAMPIONS." THE ROLE OF DIVERSITY CHAMPIONS IS TO CONDUCT MANAGEMENT DIVERSITY TRAINING, ASSIST WITH FRONT-LINE EMPLOYEE DIVERSITY EDUCATION, AND TO BE AN ADVOCATE AND ROLE MODEL OF DIVERSITY WITHIN THEIR WORK ENVIRONMENT. SIMPLY PUT, WE BELIEVE THAT FOSTERING DIVERSITY IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR COMPANY IS A BUSINESS IMPERATIVE, ONE WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS AND GROWTH. IN 2003,

MGM MIRAGE is also proud to have been a founding member of the Nevada Council on Problem Gambling. In addition to our annual support, we recently increased our giving with a special grant to fund a three-year commitment to provide an intern for the office staff as well as support training programs for non-profit organizations. We provide Problem Gambling Awareness training for all employees that address definitions, warning signs, and help that is available for employees and guests who have a gambling problem.

Our philanthropic efforts are designed around the basic belief that charity begins at home. The initial focus of our charitable program, therefore, is on our employees. We offer numerous programs to assist employees in bettering their lives, including: · · · · Employee Emergency Relief Fund Citizenship Program On-Site Child Care Center 529 College Savings Program

creating a sense of ownership among our employees. In 2002, we established the MGM MIRAGE Voice Foundation. Through this employee-directed organization more than $2.5 million was given to hundreds of worthy non-profit organizations. In addition to funding all costs associated with the Foundation, MGM MIRAGE donated an additional $2 million to hundreds of charities providing much-needed corporate funding for longer-term projects. Our commitment to enriching the lives of our neighbors is brought to life through our charitable programs, environmental policies and volunteer efforts.

MGM MIRAGE expanded its philanthropic focus to uplift the communities in which we do business by

THE INTENSE FOCUS OF OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM TRULY MAKES US THE SHINING EXAMPLE IN THE INDUSTRY.
Along with my colleagues on the management committee, I want to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of our employees who, through their dedication and commitment, continually provide unparalleled service to our guests and customers. As we look back on 2003, we see a year of considerable achievement both in terms of financial performance and corporate responsibility. By focusing on our business plan with unwavering intensity, we were able to deliver superior returns to our shareholders, increase the long-term growth potential of MGM MIRAGE, and provide meaningful opportunities for our employees, business partners and neighbors. Your management and our team of 40,000 people are devoted to achieving even greater success in 2004 and beyond.
