TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

By most measures the year 2003 was one defined by change, accomplishment and promises kept. Our multi-year structural, organizational and financial transformation continued to bear fruit in 2003 and should continue as we persist in our process to reshape the enterprise. We announced several acquisitions and divestitures, strategic investments and outsourcing agreements, and continued to strengthen our management team and Board of Directors.
We reported income from continuing operations for the 2003 fiscal year of $182 million, or $2.93 per diluted share and consolidated revenues from continuing operations of $2,042 million. Our reported financial performance was negatively impacted by several special charges and other items taken throughout the year -- including steps taken to transform the organization into one that will be stronger and more nimble with the ability to deliver higher top-line and earnings growth. Excluding those items, revenues were $2,201 million with earnings of $3.95 per diluted share -- achieving our revenue and earnings guidance of $2,195 million to $2,210 million and $3.95 to $3.98 per diluted share -- a 16 percent increase over the prior year -- by most measures an exceptional financial performance (see reconciliation on page 21). As we discuss in this report and have told you in the past, we've embarked on a long-term strategy to increase shareholder value. The key elements of this strategy are to manage the company for profitable growth, improve asset management, lower our cost structure, manage the operating companies under a unified corporate · Throughout fiscal 2003 we recorded $91 million in charges, offset by $42 million of realized capital

Capital Structure Hillenbrand continues to be a financially sound company with a strong balance sheet, cash flows and solid credit ratings. This year we added to our strong financial position by first renewing and then amending our $500 million senior revolving credit facilities. That, coupled with our $376 million in operating cash flow generated in the year and a 12 percent debt to capital ratio, enabled us to create the flexibility and capacity to acquire assets that fit our strategic needs. In July we filed a universal shelf registration for the potential sale of up to $1 billion of debt or equity securities, adding to the flexibility provided by the earlier actions and providing us unprecedented flexibility to finance acquisitions. Our goal is to maintain our current high quality ratings of A+ from Standard & Poor's and A 2 from Moody's credit rating services. Additionally during the year we repurchased $157 million of outstanding debentures using excess cash, significantly reducing our exposure to long-tenured and higher-interest debt. Other Activities

million agreement enables us to create a flexible, scalable technology infrastructure to support growth. Under the agreement, IBM is managing our data centers, help desks, data networks, and voice infrastructures and should be able to provide the flexibility to quickly add capacity as a critical component to support our growth. As we mentioned, Hill-Rom established a new business structure consisting of a Care Environment division, a Clinical division, a Services division, and international operations consisting of research and development, manufacturing, marketing and other support functions for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA). This new structure has many benefits, allowing management to speed decision making and lower costs, to better execute their plans ­ improving their ability to integrate future acquisitions. We've purposely made this change to appear seamless to our customers but it was an essential organizational change to ensure we remain competitive in today's challenging health care environment. Acquisitions and Divestitures As we mention throughout this report, activities aimed at executing our growth strategy were evident by the acquisitions of several businesses, minority investments, as well as intellectual property, and the divestiture of businesses we announced during the fiscal year and subsequent to the 2003 fiscal year-end.

In our second quarter, Hill-Rom announced it had acquired a minority ownership position in Navicare Systems, Inc., a provider of operations management and dynamic workflow solutions, and Batesville Casket Company acquired the Marsellus Casket brand name and certain other intellectual property. Both of these product and service acquisitions were intended to broaden market availability and provide greater value to our customers. Later in the year, we announced our intent to divest a business and closed the divestiture of another business

structure, and develop exceptional management talent throughout the organization. Many of the special charges and other items recognized in 2003 are a result of these strategic initiatives. · In the third quarter we announced a $9 million restructuring charge related to Hill-Rom's new business structure. This action will reduce operating costs beginning in the first quarter of calendar 2004 and enables Hill-Rom to operate under a new business structure that allows their management improved operating oversight. · In the fourth quarter, we recorded a $16 million charge related to the completion of our bond tender offer and recognized an estimated $51 million loss ­ net of tax ­ on the divestiture of two businesses. The sale of our pipedmedical gas business closed in October 2003, and the sale of our Air-Shields infant care products business is expected to close in fiscal 2004.

gains, related to the impairment of certain equity and debt securities in our Forethought investment portfolio. While not related to the key strategy elements mentioned above, it was a necessary action taken as a result of volatile investment markets. · On December 31, 2002 we announced a comprehensive settlement agreement relating to all antitrust litigation with Kinetic Concepts, Inc. While the charge related to this judgment was recorded in the 2002 fiscal year, the first of two cash payments was made in January 2003 -- $175 million -- with an additional cash payment of $75 million scheduled to be made no later than January 2004. Beyond the financial charges taken during the year we took additional steps to meet and exceed our stated goals of annually providing 10 percent revenue growth, 15 percent earnings growth and increased shareholder value. We made changes to our organization and moved to strengthen management, product and service offerings, and our capital structure during the year. Let us review each of these.

Ray J. Hillenbrand, Chairman of the Board

Key to our success in transforming the company into one that meets our stated goals is our ability to focus on what we do best, and knowing which companies to partner with to achieve our goals faster, efficiently, and cost-effectively. It's for this reason we announced an outsourcing agreement with IBM in June designed to manage our global information technology infrastructure on a costneutral basis. This seven-year $187

that resided at Hill-Rom -- our Air-Shields infant care business and our piped-medical gas distribution business. Those units had combined revenues of $101 million in fiscal 2003, and while they were profitable, we determined based on our strategic reviews that they would not be able to sufficiently contribute to our revenue and earnings growth targets over the long term. They would also require inordinate investment from the company, and we determined they would serve their markets and customers better if they were not part of our portfolio of businesses. Two recent acquisitions announced -- and one closed -- included our purchase of Advanced Respiratory, Inc., a privately held manufacturer and distributor of non-invasive airway clearance products and systems, for approximately $83 million, subject to certain adjustments and contingent payments. The other announced acquisition yet to be closed is Mediq, Inc., a privately held company providing medical equipment outsourcing, asset management and peak needs rentals to hospitals, extended care and home medical equipment marketers -- with an expected purchase price of $330 million. Board of Directors As we remain focused on the opportunities ahead we are pleased that two highly-qualified professionals have agreed to join our Board. It's also with a great deal of respect that we report the retirement of two of our distinguished directors who have served us so well for so many years. On December 5th, we announced that both Daniel

Hillenbrand and John Hancock were retiring from the Board and that Dr. Anne Griswold Peirce, R.N., Ph.D., and Dr. Joanne C. Smith, M.D. would be joining us as we lead the company forward. Dan Hillenbrand's and John Hancock's guidance and counsel will be deeply missed. Their many years of service and leadership have had a profound impact on the company, and we have been honored to have the experience and insight they've offered to us over the years. As a matter of fact, while Dan Hillenbrand retains the title of Chairman Emeritus, this will mark the 56th year of service he has provided to the company as a senior operating officer, chief executive officer, and member of the Board. Our two new highly qualified members come to us with a wealth of experience from which we will draw. Dr. Anne Griswold Peirce, R.N., Ph.D. is Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and Associate Professor of Clinical Nursing at the Columbia

University School of Nursing, New York, New York, and Dr. Joanne C. Smith, M.D. is currently Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Business Development at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. We look forward to drawing upon their counsel and their experiences, as they are both highly accomplished in the fields of health care management and health care academia. Outlook As we look ahead to the year before us we expect to continue to execute on our strategy and meet our goals. To all our shareholders, we reaffirm the commitment that everyone at Hillenbrand is focused on creating shareholder value for our owners. We ask that you judge our performance in 2003 against our accomplishments outlined in this report. We speak for all employees when we say that we intend to deliver. Thank you for your investment in Hillenbrand. December 23, 2003
