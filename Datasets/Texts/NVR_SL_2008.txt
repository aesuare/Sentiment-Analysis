 TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Fiscal year 2008 was another challenging year for our company and our industry. Potential homebuyers were faced with
several headwinds, including tighter lending standards, higher unemployment rates, dwindling investment balances, and news of a deepening recession. As a result, consumer confidence fell to historic lows and the demand for new homes weakened significantly. In addition, the housing market continued to experience high inventories of both new and existing homes, as well as high foreclosure rates. All of these factors contributed to the downward pressure on housing prices in all of our markets; and consequently, downward pressure on our profitability.
We reacted to these changing market conditions throughout the year. We exited underperforming communities, altered
product offerings where appropriate, priced our homes competitively, and reduced construction costs. We also continued to take aggressive action to lower overhead costs. Relative to our peak levels in 2006, we have reduced headcount by 53% and the number of homebuilding divisions we operate by 39%. These steps were necessary to maintain profitability in 2008. As a result, we were the only public homebuilder to post a profit in 2008. We accomplished this while also increasing market share across our footprint. We achieved the following results in 2008:
• Homebuilding revenue was $3.6 billion
• $101 million of net income
• Diluted earnings per share of $17.04
• Cash flow from operations was $462 million • 8,760 new orders
• Year-end backlog was 3,164 units, with a dollar value of $1.0 billion
These results and the current housing downturn in general remind us that homebuilding is a cyclical industry. Despite the current downturn, we must not become distracted by macroeconomic factors that we cannot control. Instead, it is crucial for us to focus on factors that we can control.
For NVR, this focus starts with ensuring that the customer comes first. Whether we are helping our customers navigate financing options, assisting them with selling an existing home, building a quality home, or standing behind our product, we strive to exceed our customers’ expectations through all stages of their home purchase. Valuing our customers in this way is simply the right thing to do.
Another part of our business that we can control is our unwavering commitment to our proven business strategy – a strategy that emphasizes liquidity and minimizes risk. Unlike our major competitors, we are not in the land development business. By avoiding land development, avoiding speculative building, and focusing exclusively on homebuilding, we have achieved

 the highest inventory turnover, return on equity, and return on capital in the industry. The liquidity generated by this model has allowed us to continue to strengthen our balance sheet. This liquidity also provides us with greater flexibility than our competitors to take advantage of opportunities that may arise, especially in the current credit-constrained economy. This business model has been vital to our past success, regardless of the economic environment, and we intend to continue to utilize it in the future.
We thank our all of our partners for their remarkable efforts this year. Our employees, suppliers, subcontractors, and developers all recognize the difficult homebuilding environment we are in today. Their commitment to NVR is important to our success and will be crucial to helping us to work through the current housing downturn. We also thank our customers for choosing NVR as their homebuilder. We understand that they have a choice in selecting a builder and we work hard to reaffirm their choice well beyond delivering their home.
As we look forward, 2009 will likely be as challenging as 2008. Nevertheless, we are confident that we will be able to use our financial strength, proven business strategies, and dedicated team of employees to weather this economic cycle. The strength of our balance sheet will allow us to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the near term, and positions us to thrive when economic conditions improve.
Sincerely,
