Coach's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June 30. Fiscal year 1999 was a 53-week year, while fiscal years 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2001 were 52-week years. During 1999, Coach committed to and completed a reorganization plan involving the closure of its Carlstadt, New Jersey warehouse and distribution center, the closure of its Italian manufacturing operation, and the reorganization of its Medley, Florida manufacturing facility. During 2001, Coach committed to and completed a reorganization plan involving the complete closure of its Medley, Florida manufacturing operation. These actions were intended to reduce costs, resulted in the transfer of production to lower cost third-party manufacturers and consolidation of all of its distribution functions at the Jacksonville, Florida distribution center. $1.54 per share after adding back the impact of the reorganization charge and if the common shares sold in the October 2000 initial public offering had been outstanding for the entire year. per share after adding back the impact of the reorganization charge and if the common shares sold in the October 2000 initial public offering had been outstanding for the entire year. $0.89 per share if the common shares sold in the October 2000 initial public offering had been outstanding for the prior periods. $0.38 per share if the common shares sold in the October 2000 initial public offering had been outstanding for the prior periods.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

Coach generates revenue by selling its products through two channels of distribution: direct to consumers and indirectly through wholesale customers and by licensing its brand name to select manufacturers. Direct to consumer sales consist of sales of Coach products through its 121 Company-operated U.S. retail stores, its direct mail catalogs, its e-commerce website and its 68 Companyoperated U.S. factory stores. Indirect sales consist of sales of Coach products to approximately 1,400 department store and specialty retailer locations in the U.S., and approximately 175 international department store, retail store and duty free shop locations in 18 countries. In the U.S. Coach generates additional wholesale sales through business-to-business programs, in which companies purchase Coach products to use as gifts or incentive rewards. Licensing revenues consist of royalties paid to Coach under licensing arrangements with select manufacturers for the sale of Coach branded watches, footwear and furniture. Coach's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to June 30. Fiscal year 1999 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal years 2000 and 2001 each consisted of 52 weeks.

NET SALES

Net sales increased by 12.2% to $616.1 million in fiscal 2001 from $548.9 million in fiscal 2000. These results reflect increased volume in both the direct to consumer and indirect channels.
D I R E C T. Net sales increased 11.3% to $391.8 million in fiscal 2001 from $352.0 million in fiscal 2000. The increase was primarily due to new store openings, store renovations, store expansions and comparable stores sales growth. Comparable store sales growth for retail stores and factory stores open for one full year was 2.1% and 4.3%, respectively. Since the end of fiscal 2000, Coach has opened 15 new retail stores and five new factory stores. In addition, 28 retail stores and five factory stores were remodeled, while three retail stores and one factory store were expanded. No stores were closed during fiscal 2001.

I N D I R E C T. Net sales attributable to domestic and international wholesale shipments increased 13.9% to $224.3 million in fiscal 2001 from $196.9 million in fiscal 2000. The increase was primarily due to strong gains in the international wholesale channel, highlighted by continued double-digit increases in comparable location sales to Japanese consumers worldwide and increased demand for new products. Licensing revenue increased 23.6% to $2.2 million in fiscal 2001 from $1.8 million in fiscal 2000 due primarily to expanded distribution of licensed footwear product.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit increased 20.9% to $397.6 million in fiscal 2001 from $328.8 million in fiscal 2000. Gross margin increased approximately 460 basis points to 64.5% in fiscal 2001 from 59.9% in fiscal 2000. This improvement was driven by a shift in product mix, reflecting the continued diversification into non-leather fabrications with new and successful mixed-material collections. In addition, gross margin benefited from the continuing impact of sourcing cost reductions as well as channel mix, as the international channel continued to expand as a percentage of sales. The following chart illustrates the gross margin performance we have experienced over the last eight quarters:

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 6.8% to $291.3 million in fiscal 2001 from $272.8 million in fiscal 2000. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 47.3% as a percentage of net sales versus 49.7% in fiscal 2000. Selling expenses increased by 14.8% to $178.3 million, or 28.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $155.4 million, or 28.3% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to $16.3 million of operating costs associated with new retail and factory stores; increased variable costs for comparable store sales; store remodels; costs to support the additional stores; and store sales promotions to enhance sales. The remaining selling expense increase was caused primarily by volume-related costs in our indirect sales channels. Advertising, marketing, and design expenses increased by 4.0% to $52.2 million, or 8.5% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $50.2 million, or 9.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The dollar increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased staffing expenses of $1.0 million and increased advertising expenses of $0.6 million. Distribution and customer service expenses increased slightly to $25.8 million, or 4.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $25.3 million, or 4.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The dollar increase in these expenses was due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by efficiency gains at our distribution and customer service facility. Administrative expenses decreased to $35.0 million, or 5.7% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $41.9 million, or 7.6% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The decrease in these expenses was due to lower fringe benefit costs and lower performance-based compensation expenses, partially offset by higher occupancy costs associated with the lease renewal of our New York City corporate headquarters location and incremental expenses incurred to support new corporate governance activities relating to the Company becoming publicly owned.
R E O R G A N I Z AT I O N C O S T S

In the first fiscal quarter of 2001 management of Coach committed to and announced a plan to cease production at the Medley, Florida manufacturing facility in October 2000. This reorganization involved the termination of 362 manufacturing, warehousing and management employees at the Medley facility. These actions are intended to reduce costs by the resulting transfer of production to lower cost third-party manufacturers. Coach achieved cost savings of $2.7 million in fiscal 2001 and expects $4.5 million in annual savings in future years from these actions. Coach recorded a reorganization cost of $5.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2001. In the second half of fiscal year 2001, this charge was reduced to $4.6 million. This was due primarily to the complete disposition of the fixed assets, in which the proceeds exceeded original estimates by management. This reorganization cost includes $3.1 million for worker separation costs, $0.8 million for lease termination costs and $0.6 million for the write-down of long-lived assets to net realizable value. By June 30, 2001, production ceased at the Medley facility, disposition of the fixed assets had been accomplished and the termination of the 362 employees had been completed.
O P E R AT I N G I N C O M E

Operating income increased 81.5% to $101.7 million from $56.0 million in fiscal 2000. This increase resulted from higher sales and improved gross margins, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. Before the impact of reorganization costs, operating income increased 89.7% to $106.3 million, or 17.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $56.0 million, or 10.2% of net sales, in fiscal 2000.
INT ERE ST E XPE NSE

Net interest expense increased 483% to $2.3 million, or 0.4% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $0.4 million or 0.1% of net sales, in fiscal 2000. The increase was due to interest expense on the note payable to an affiliate of the Sara Lee Corporation ("Sara Lee") that Coach assumed in October 2000 as part of the initial public offering and interest expense on borrowings on its new Fleet National Bank facility ("Fleet" facility), which replaced the facility previously provided by Sara Lee. There was no interest expense incurred on the facility provided by Sara Lee in the prior year.

20.

I N C O M E TA X E S

The effective tax rate increased to 35.6% in fiscal 2001 from 30.6% in fiscal 2000. This increase was caused by a lower percentage of income in fiscal 2001 attributable to Company-owned offshore manufacturing, which is taxed at lower rates.
NE T INCOME

Net income increased 65.9% to $64.0 million from $38.6 million in fiscal 2000. This increase was the result of increased operating income partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes and increased interest expense. Before the impact of reorganization costs, net of related tax effect, net income increased 73.5% to $67.0 million, or 10.9% of net sales, in fiscal 2001 from $38.6 million, or 7.0% of net sales, in fiscal 2000.
EARNINGS PER SHARE

Diluted net income per share was $1.52 in fiscal 2001. This reflects a weighted average of the shares outstanding before and after the initial public offering of common stock in October 2000. If the common shares sold in the October 2000 initial public offering had been outstanding for the entire year, net income before the impact of reorganization costs per diluted share would have been $1.50. Prior year diluted net income per share was $1.10 since only the shares owned by Sara Lee are used in the calculation. Comparable net earnings per share in fiscal 2000 would have been $0.89 if the common shares sold in the October 2000 public offering had been outstanding for the prior period.
FI S C A L 2000 C O M PAR E D TO FI S C A L 1999

NET SALES

Net sales increased by 8.1% to $548.9 million in fiscal 2000 from $507.8 million during fiscal 1999. These results reflect increased volume in the indirect channels and, to a lesser extent, in the direct channel.
D I R E C T. Net sales increased 4.6% to $352.0 million in fiscal 2000 from $336.5 million during fiscal 1999. This sales growth was primarily attributable to comparable store sales growth of 7.5% and the opening of eight new retail stores and two new factory stores. Comparable store sales growth for retail stores and factory stores open for one full year was 11.7% and 3.4%, respectively. Coach renovated 23 retail stores during fiscal 2000, which generated incremental sales growth after their renovation. This growth was partially offset by a $7.3 million reduction of warehouse sales events and employee sales, the closing of three retail stores and one factory store and the temporary closure of some stores for renovations.

I N D I R E C T. Net sales increased 14.9% to $196.9 million in fiscal 2000 from $171.3 million during fiscal 1999. This increase resulted from increased demand for Coach's new product assortments and the economic recovery in Asia. Licensing revenue increased 138% to $1.8 million in fiscal 2000. This increase reflects the full-year impact of the Coach footwear licensing arrangement and the introduction of the furniture licensing arrangement in the Spring of 1999.

GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit increased 16.8% to $328.8 million in fiscal 2000 from $281.6 million in fiscal 1999. Gross margin increased to 59.9% in fiscal 2000 from 55.4% in fiscal 1999. This increase in gross margin was primarily due to manufacturing and sourcing-cost reductions realized during fiscal 2000 from Coach's reorganization that commenced in 1999, as well as increased sales at Coach's retail stores and increased shipments to international distributors. In fiscal 2000, approximately 74% of Coach's total units produced were manufactured by independent manufacturers, compared to approximately 48% in fiscal 1999. Gross profit also increased as a result of the reduction of warehouse sales events and the reduction in employee sales, which have lower gross margins.
S E L L I N G , G E N E R A L A N D A D M I N I S T R AT I V E E X P E N S E S

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 7.0% to $272.8 million in fiscal 2000 from $255.0 million in fiscal 1999. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 49.7%, compared to 50.2% in fiscal 1999. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2000 increased in dollars but decreased as a percentage of net sales.

COACH, INC.

MDACONT INUED

Selling expenses increased by $3.3 million in fiscal 2000, primarily because of $2.5 million in operating costs associated with eight new retail stores, two new factory stores and six store expansions. Advertising, marketing and design costs increased by $6.5 million in fiscal 2000, primarily as a result of increased advertising expenses of $3.2 million and increased staffing expenses of $2.2 million. Distribution and customer service costs declined by $1.4 million, reflecting the first full year impact of the consolidation of all of Coach's distribution operations into its Jacksonville, Florida facility. Administrative expenses increased by $9.3 million in fiscal 2000. The increase in administrative expenses was the result of $11.3 million of incremental performance-based compensation versus fiscal 1999 due to improvements in operating income. Performance-based compensation is calculated utilizing preset financial targets. The compensation increase was partially offset by a $2.0 million reduction in salaries and consulting fees.
O P E R AT I N G I N C O M E

Operating income increased 187.2% to $56.0 million in fiscal 2000 from $19.5 million in fiscal 1999. Before the impact of reorganization costs in fiscal 1999, operating income increased 110.5% to $56.0 million in fiscal 2000 from $26.6 million in fiscal 1999. This increase resulted from the overall increase in sales and improved gross margin in fiscal 2000, which was partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses.
I N C O M E TA X E S

Coach's effective tax rate increased to 30.6% in fiscal 2000 from 12.3% during fiscal 1999, due to a lower percentage of income attributable to company-owned offshore manufacturing that is taxed at lower rates.
NE T INCOME

Net income increased 131.1% to $38.6 million in fiscal 2000 from $16.7 million during fiscal 1999. This increase was the result of increased operating income partially offset by a higher provision for income taxes.

Net cash provided by operating and investing activities was $93.3 million in fiscal 2001, 51.4% higher than the $61.6 million provided in fiscal 2000. The $31.7 million year-to-year increase in cash provided from operating activities was primarily the result of higher earnings. Capital expenditures amounted to $31.9 million in fiscal 2001, compared to $26.1 million in fiscal 2000 and in both periods related primarily to new and renovated retail stores. Our future capital expenditures will depend on the timing and rate of expansion of our businesses, new store openings, store renovations and international expansion opportunities. On July 2, 2000, we entered into a revolving credit facility with Sara Lee under which Coach could borrow up to $75 million from Sara Lee. This facility was paid off and terminated on February 27, 2001. To provide funding for working capital for operations and general corporate purposes, on February 27, 2001, Coach, certain lenders and Fleet National Bank, as primary lender and administrative agent, entered into a $100 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. Indebtedness under this revolving credit facility bears interest calculated, at Coach's option, at either:
 

a rate of LIBOR plus 70 to 150 basis points based on a rolling four-quarter fixed-charge coverage grid; or the prime rate announced by Fleet.

22.

The initial LIBOR margin under the facility was 125 basis points. As of May 2001, the LIBOR margin was reduced to 100 basis points to reflect an improvement in the fixed-charge coverage ratio, calculated quarterly in accordance with the pricing grid. Under this revolving credit facility, Coach will pay a commitment fee of 20 to 35 basis points based on any unused amounts, based on the same fixed-charge coverage grid. The initial commitment fee was 30 basis points. As of May 2001, the commitment fee was reduced to 25 basis points. This credit facility may be prepaid without penalty or premium. The Fleet facility contains various covenants and customary events of default, including:
 

Maintenance of a cash flow leverage ratio not greater than 1.5 to 1.0; Maintenance of a fixed-charge coverage ratio greater than 1.75 to 1.0 until March 30, 2002 and greater than 2.0 to 1.0 thereafter;  Annual paydown to $25 million for 30 consecutive days during the period November 1 through June 30; and  Restrictions on other indebtedness, liens, payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions, transactions with affiliates, and sale and leaseback transactions in excess of amounts approved by the lenders. The Company has been in compliance with all covenants of the Fleet facility since its inception. The Company opened 15 new retail stores and five factory stores in fiscal year 2001. The Company expects to complete its store renovations program in fiscal 2002. The Company expects that fiscal 2002 capital expenditures for new retail stores will be approximately $16 million and that capital expenditures for store renovations will be approximately $11 million. The Company intends to finance these investments from internally generated cash flow or by using funds from its revolving credit facility. The Company experiences significant seasonal variations in working capital requirements. During the first fiscal quarter the Company builds up inventory for the holiday selling season, opens new retail stores and generates higher levels of trade receivables. In the second fiscal quarter working capital requirements are reduced substantially as the Company generates consumer sales and collects wholesale accounts receivable. In fiscal 2001, Coach purchased approximately $222 million of inventory, which was funded by operating cash flow and by borrowings under its revolving credit facilities. During fiscal 2001 the peak borrowings under the Sara Lee and Fleet revolving credit facilities were $37.7 million and $31.0 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2001, the outstanding borrowings under the Fleet facility were $7.7 million. Coach believes that its operating cash flow, together with the revolving credit facility, will provide sufficient capital to fund operations for the foreseeable future. Currently, Sara Lee is a guarantor or a party to many of the Company's store leases. The Company has agreed to make efforts to remove Sara Lee from all of its existing leases, and Sara Lee is not a guarantor or a party to any new or renewed leases. The Company has obtained a letter of credit for the benefit of Sara Lee in an amount approximately equal to the annual minimum rental payments under leases transferred to Coach by Sara Lee but for which Sara Lee retains contingent liability. The Company is required to maintain the letter of credit until the annual minimum rental payments under the relevant leases are less than $2.0 million. The initial letter of credit has a face amount of $20.6 million and the Company expects this amount to decrease annually as its guaranteed obligations are reduced and the Company expects that we will be required to maintain the letter of credit for at least 10 years.
SEASONALITY

Because its products are frequently given as gifts, the Company has historically realized, and expects to continue to realize, higher sales and operating income in the second quarter of its fiscal year, which includes the holiday months of November and December. The Company has sometimes experienced, and may continue to experience, reduced income or net losses in any or all of its first, third or fourth quarters. The higher sales in the second quarter typically result in higher operating profits and margins. This is due to higher gross profits, with no substantial corresponding increase in fixed costs, related to operating retail stores and other administrative and selling costs, which remain fairly constant throughout the year. During the holiday season these fixed costs are spread over higher sales, resulting in greater operating income expressed in both dollars and as a percentage of sales in the second quarter compared to the other three quarters. The Company anticipates that its sales and operating profit will continue to be seasonal in nature.
