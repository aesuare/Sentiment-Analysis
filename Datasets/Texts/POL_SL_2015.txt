While 2015 was a year with many highlights, it was also a year in which we faced short-term challenges. Revenues declined as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange, lower selling prices in Distribution and Performance Products and Solutions due to lower hydro-carbon based raw material costs, and the ongoing integration of the former Spartech businesses. Ultimately, our results fell just short of our goal of annual double-digit EPS expansion.
Yet in their own way, these temporary headwinds proved to be a galvanizing experience for our exceptional team of associates who rallied to overcome them. During the course of our efforts, we did not sacrifice our intermediate or long-term growth potential or deviate from our proven four-pillar strategy—achieving many important successes as follows:
SPECIALIZATION
65% of our operating income was generated from our specialty businesses in 2015—continuing the highest level in the history of our company. Back in 2005, it was just 2%. That tremendous growth is a testament to our investments in customer-driven innovation, solutions and design services.

to help them grow and investing in commercial resources who provide exemplary service. We also solidified our leadership team and further developed our culture of excellence shared among 6,900 global associates.

products introduced in the last five years. In 2015, our Vitality Index was an impressive 43%, truly world-class performance.
We launched several new products this year, including the exciting and game-changing ColorMatrixTM Fiber Colorant Solutions, ColorMatrixTM Select, a cloud-based liquid color creation and supply service; and InVisiOSM Color Inspiration 2016, a collection of emerging colors used when inspiring and collaborating with our customers during their product design process.
We launched a dedicated team to serve the outdoor high performance market, where customers are utilizing our high- strength, lightweight materials to replace metal and improve the design and performance of their products. In 2015 this included a unique Engineered Material formulation based on our Gravi-TechTM High Density Composite material.
GLOBALIZATION
Globalization means serving our multi-national customers with consistency and excellence anywhere in the world that they need us, which is why we continued to invest for the future. We were extremely proud to open our new Asia Innovation Center in Shanghai in June to improve cross-business unit collaboration with our customers and increase our speed to market.
In December, we acquired Magenta Master Fibers from BASF, which expanded our specialty colorant business for fiber applications, as well as grew our resources and presence in Europe and Asia.
As we grow our global customer base and footprint, we are ensuring that our people are prepared to lead and serve customers with excellence. We further advanced our global leadership training and development programs, underpinned by the success of our flagship offerings for future leaders— NextGen and PolyMasters.
COMMERCIAL EXCELLENCE
Our unique approach to the marketplace is led by our talented sales, technology and marketing teams. As we approach customers, it’s now with a more unified front. We call it “One PolyOne,” and it’s a theme and shift we’ve been pursuing since 2014. The true power of our company is in the broad solutions portfolio we offer to maximize the benefits we provide to our customers—and in turn, our shareholders.
Such is the case with a prominent and innovative healthcare leader who named us “Supplier of the Year” for the second year in a row. The company selected PolyOne based on our unique ability to bring solutions from our Engineered Materials, Color and Distribution businesses.
With an estimated $40 billion in addressable market opportunity and a world-class portfolio to address it, we not only train our existing sales force to be the best, we strategically invest in
new resources to generate growth. Last year we increased our sales force by 9%, and we expect a sustainable return on those important commercial investments in 2016 and beyond.
A growing strength throughout PolyOne is our specialty services capability. It’s become our timeless differentiator. We continue to formalize additional service offerings that extend well beyond specialty polymer formulations—yet they are clearly complementary and value-added for our customers. For example, in 2015 we temporarily deployed several of our skilled LSS black belts to multiple customers to help improve their manufacturing and development processes. We also expanded
the scope of our IQ Design services offering, so that more customers can now benefit from our design expertise.
OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE
Operational Excellence begins with safety. It’s a mindset and a way of life at PolyOne. Consistent with this commitment, we were pleased to have lowered our injury incident rate from 0.84 to 0.74, which is six times better than the Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing Industry average of 4.6.
Likewise, Lean Six Sigma (LSS) remains at the core of formal process improvement at PolyOne. More than 3,300 of our associates are trained on the methodology, and at any given time there are dozens of projects being conducted globally to improve our operations, sales processes, systems or any activities that could benefit from quality or efficiency gains.
A large focus of our LSS activity last year was within our Designed Structures and Solutions (DSS) business segment. Comprised of the sheet, rollstock and packaging businesses of the former Spartech, we have made substantial progress and improvements, yet much opportunity—and work—still remain. We’ve taken concerted actions to improve on-time delivery rates, quality, operations and the commercial approach at
DSS to better serve our customers—all of which continue to be areas we’re focusing on. We were also pleased to welcome Rich Altice as president of DSS who, along with our global head of operations John Midea, has been strategically making the necessary changes to deliver value and further the specialty transformation progress in 2016.
A PLATINUM VISION FOR THE FUTURE
At our Investor Day in May, we unveiled new, aggressive performance targets for our company. They constitute what we’re calling our 2020 Platinum Vision. Each new performance objective evokes the strengths of our transformation thus far, including innovation, collaboration and service—all of which we will use to better serve our customers—the underlying enabler to PolyOne’s growth.
As we embark on this path, I am enthusiastic about what this
will mean for our valued customers, and I would like to first and foremost thank them for choosing PolyOne as a partner for their material science and services needs. To our shareholders—both long-term owners of our stock and those new to our company— thank you for your trust in PolyOne’s ability to deliver and
grow. Our diverse and talented Board of Directors continues
to provide ongoing support and guidance, and I am thankful
for their important contributions and perspectives. And finally, thank you to the great team of PolyOne associates around the world. I remain inspired by the work they do every day to serve our customers. I am proud to stand beside them in our ongoing quest to deliver excellence in all that we do—for our customers, shareholders and each other.
In summary, 2015 was a year our team joined together to overcome many challenges and found a way to win. We delivered record earnings per share while also investing for the future.
In 2016, we will work hard to continue to build upon our momentum, execute our strategy and progress in our pursuit of platinum performance!
