 The new millennium ushered in major challenges for the transportation industry. As a result, it was a year marred by increasing trucking business failures and decreasing profits. In spite of this unusually tough operating environment, J.B. Hunt Transport Services was able to post improved earnings and financial results. Certainly
our profitability fell short of both our expectations and acceptable returns, but we are encouraged by the level of progress we achieved under extremely adverse conditions.
The 21st Century began with oil prices setting ten-year highs. The run-up in diesel fuel prices which began in the second half
of 1999 zoomed to new heights in the first quarter of 2000, topping out 54 percent higher than the first quarter of 1999 and costing the company 17 cents per share of earnings net of fuel surcharges in the first quarter alone. The volatile fuel prices abated slightly in the second quarter, only to set new highs in the second half of the year. Intense effort was expended in educating
our customers to the severe penalty we
were incurring for high fuel prices, and better fuel surcharges were negotiated beyond the first quarter.
In addition to extremely high fuel prices, the transportation industry is facing a number of other cost pressures. With the decline of the U.S. stock market, insurance companies have begun to stress profitability from underwriting activities as opposed to relying on lucrative gains from investments. As a result, most carriers are faced with soaring insurance premiums. Increases of 25 to 100 percent are being reported as commonplace.
J.B. Hunt has been primarily self-insured for the better part of a decade, and therefore does not rely on low-deductible insurance
for the major part of its risk management. Contributing to our industry-leading low cost of insurance and claims is our dedication to safety. Safe, experienced drivers are a key to our significant improvement in safety over the past several years. The Company experienced its best year in history in 2000 in reducing serious accidents and injury. With the cost of insurance and claims rising
substantially, our industry-leading compensation and time-off programs are important in keeping our trucks seated with the highest quality, most professionally conscientious drivers available. While we were unable to reach the optimal number of drivers to attain an acceptable level of utilization of our assets for most of the year, steady improvement throughout the year found us in the best position we have ever experienced by year’s end. In fact, the Company has been forced to implement a hiring cap early in 2001. We continue to believe, now more than ever, that he who has the best drivers wins.
Higher interest rates, a slowing economy that plagued the year almost from the start, and plunging used-truck values have added additional hardship to the industry. Carriers unable to trade in their equipment or use it effectively, facing values below book and finding financing drying up, have begun
to disappear at alarming rates. With manufacturers reporting steep drops in new equipment orders and predictions for an even worsening used-truck market combined with unusually high costs in the other areas mentioned, conditions appear ripe for a massive correction in the supply of capacity to the freight market. The Company is unable to predict the precise timing of when demand will exceed the available capacity, but anticipates growing truckload scarcity later in 2001. Additionally, the Company also expects rising freight rates to reflect the demand/supply imbalance and return some of the onerous cost increases that have hampered the industry for the last several years. Very simply, freight rates have not kept pace with a burgeoning economy and higher operating costs. Unfortunately, the result is a number of weak providers in a very necessary, fundamental segment of our economy. Adequate margins and return on invested capital must be restored in order to support the needs of the shipping public.
The Company’s focus is on improving the margins in the Truck segment of our business while maintaining profitable growth in the Dedicated Contract Services and Intermodal segments. Focus is a virtue that has served us well in the past. Paring down our service

 offerings to three and separating the Truck and Intermodal segments have allowed us to perform micro-diagnostics on each unit and prescribe the necessary actions to improve results. Applying the “cure” is our sole objective for 2001. No growth in capacity
is planned for the Truck segment until margins reflect the risk inherent in operating this random over-the-road business. The Company will continue to add capacity, as is profitably required, for Dedicated operations and will seek opportunities for profitable expansion of our Intermodal business.
Finally, a word about our Transplace.com alliance. The Company, along with five other truckload carriers, merged our non- asset based logistics businesses together to create a world-class, Internet-based, global transportation logistics company. The combination was completed on July 1, 2000. As the dot-com world continues to sort itself out, those companies that add value to supply chain delivery systems with real
customers, real business and real assets that can execute the strategies engineered with and by the best transportation logistics professionals will excel in the marketplace. Transplace.com, which meets and exceeds those criteria, has positioned itself, backed by the substantial assets and commitment of six of the nation’s leading carriers, to be successful. We expect this bold, innovative initiative to be THE watershed event in the new world order of logistics services.
In conclusion, while the environment has been extremely unkind to transportation providers, and while we are dissatisfied with our overall performance and financial results for the year, we are encouraged
and confident that the progress we have demonstrated is real and sustainable. We seek to build on that improvement and return J.B. Hunt to respectable margins and returns on your investment. Your patience is appreciated.

Six of the nation’s largest truckload carriers form new entity.

   In January 1992, J.B. Hunt Logistics was created as a logistics management service company in response to customer interest and industry trends in third-party logistics and outsourcing. Over time, J.B. Hunt Logistics evolved into a system that provided customers with solutions for complex logistics problems utilizing pioneering modeling techniques and algorithms. While their developments in technology and their experienced personnel progressively positioned
J.B. Hunt Logistics as an industry leader, a larger vision was emerging. This vision developed into the building of a large-scale network of unsurpassed capacity and freight volume and synchronizing it with one of the most advanced e-business logistics and optimization platforms ever conceived. In April 2000, J.B. Hunt Logistics combined with the existing transportation logistics business units of
six of the largest publicly held truckload companies to become Transplace.com., LLC. (Transplace.com).
Transplace.com, led by Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jun-Sheng Li, opened with over 5,000 partner carriers providing capacity in multiple modes of transportation for more than 1.2 million annual shipments. Their mission: “To leverage their large-scale network and logistics technologies to optimize freight and assets while driving down network costs, improving service system-wide and marshalling and deploying committed capacity where and when it is most needed.” Transplace.com will become “The Supermarket for Transportation Solutions,” providing a full spectrum of global transportation services, including: carrier management, freight exchange, total logistics management, web hosting and fleet services. Transplace.com differentiates itself from other logistics competitors via technology, experience and an established, trusted market presence.
So what new opportunities does Transplace.com present for J.B. Hunt?
As Transplace.com evolves and develops,
it continues to afford J.B. Hunt the opportunity to provide extended services to our customers and therefore support our abilities to more perfectly meet their needs and expectations. Our customers will realize an integrated supply-chain analysis, design, and operational effort that combines the asset and operational strengths of the most innovative truckload service provider in the marketplace with the most advanced web- based logistics technology available. While Transplace.com remains an effective means of broadening our service offerings and market coverage, its network efficiencies also provide us opportunities to minimize our empty-mile costs and increase our utilization. As Transplace.com continues to integrate its systems and expand its business development efforts, its freight network is also increasing, which provides J.B. Hunt another channel to aggressively pursue our cost-reduction and productivity goals. The Transplace.com network will also assist both the truckload and the dedicated divisions as we create more driver-friendly routes and increase our load ratios.
In addition to the internal growth and efficiency prospects already mentioned, J.B. Hunt’s 27 percent ownership stake in Transplace.com provides an innovative opportunity to increase our operational efficiency. Transplace.com has our complete support in its business integration and development efforts. As J.B. Hunt Logistics did in the past, Transplace.com continues to bring new and exciting opportunities to our customers and
J.B. Hunt, while we continue concentrating on our truckload, intermodal and dedicated business.
