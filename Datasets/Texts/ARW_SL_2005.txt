To Our Shareholders
Three years ago, we developed our strategic framework for pursuing our goal of becoming the clear number one provider of products and services in our industry and a premium investment for our shareholders. Since then, we have grown our sales by nearly $4 billion, a compound annual growth rate of more than 15 percent and the equivalent of adding a Fortune 500 company. Net income has climbed from $15 million in 2002 to $265 million in 2005.*
Our success has been driven by our focus on the four pillars of our strategy: 1)Grow our sales organically and faster than the markets we serve 2) Achieve operational excellence through continuous process improvement 3) Strengthen our financial position by delivering profitable growth that exceeds sales growth and by improving our balance sheet 4) Build a global management team and engage every employee through shared leadership.

We have developed a business model that will deliver more consistent financial results across the industry cycles. Our strong financial foundation enables us to invest in capabilities that will drive future growth. Growth in every business... We serve two core customer segments ­ original equipment and contract manufacturers of technology products and value-added resellers serving the enterprise computing market. Our two major businesses provide products and solutions ­ including technical design, materials management, inventory planning,

and manufacturing services ­ that accelerate the journey to market of electronic products and enterprise computing solutions. Industry experts estimate that technology manufacturers purchased $300 billion of electronic components in 2005. These manufacturers design and produce products that range from household appliances to wireless networks. To serve this market, we combine Arrow's global capabilities with local market expertise in North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Arrow North American Components (NAC) serves an estimated $60 billion market and is the largest electronic components distributor in the region. In 2005, NAC generated sales of $3.8 billion, and grew market share in our key product categories. NAC showed the best operating results since the boom years of 1999 and 2000, with the highest operating income, the lowest expense ratios, and the highest return on working capital. Asset management reached new records of performance while customer satisfaction rates rose. With this strong foundation, NAC is targeting end markets such as industrial, automotive, lighting, and medical systems where the electronic component content in manufacturing continues to grow. In Europe, despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions and a declining market for components, we posted sales of more than $3 billion and gained share in key markets including the Nordic and Eastern European regions. Our strategy for serving this $40 billion components market is to combine a Pan-European support structure that reduces our costs and drives regional supplier relationships with an extensive local sales and marketing network. During 2005, in anticipation of the continued migration of manufacturing to Eastern Europe, we expanded our local sales organization and now have nine locations serving manufacturers in this region.

Today, we lead our industry in

operating income, cash flow generation, net income, and return on invested capital.

By 2008, the Asia Pacific region will account for close to 60 percent of the global consumption of components, creating an estimated $170 billion market. In the past three years, we have more than doubled the size of our business, posting 2005 sales of $1.5 billion. Today, we serve a broad base of more than 10,000 customers. In 2005, we added or expanded our franchises with more than 15 key suppliers. In China, now the third largest semiconductor consumer in the world, we opened three new sales locations and two new distribution centers. In December, we completed the purchase of 70.7 percent of Ultra Source Technology Corporation, a leading distributor in Taiwan and a provider of consumer digital technology to manufacturers. Ultra Source strengthens our position in Taiwan, an important gateway to the Greater China market. With the increasing requirements for information storage, security solutions, and enterprise management applications, the global market for enterprise computing has grown to more than $100 billion. Today, an estimated 15 percent of this market is served through the distributor-to-reseller channel. Arrow Enterprise Computing Solutions (ECS) provides servers, storage solutions, software, training, and services to valueadded resellers as they develop enterprise solutions for their end customers. In North America, ECS has delivered 18 consecutive quarters of year-over-year operating income growth, posting 2005 sales of $2.4 billion. In 2005, we embarked on our first international expansion of this business with the acquisition of DNSint.com AG, a leading provider of Sun Microsystems and security products and solutions in Europe. As the demand for computing solutions grows globally, we anticipate additional opportunities to expand this business.

...reinforced through service and operational excellence...

Our commitment to service excellence begins with our customers and anticipating their changing needs. With the initiation of environmental regulations restricting the use of hazardous substances in Europe (RoHS), and with regulations pending in other regions, customers face new challenges during product design. Selection of environmentally compliant components and computer products has an immediate effect on today's design decisions for tomorrow's products. By leveraging our design information and component-selection tools and by including compliance data, we offer customers solutions that reduce the risks of product delays and non-compliant inventory. Annually, our businesses around the globe manage millions of customer and supplier transactions, and we ship more than 29 billion units. We simplify the supply chain for our customers and suppliers by managing its complexity, enabling them to bring their products to market faster and more profitably. That demands flawless execution and operational excellence at all levels in the organization. In early 2005, we launched Lean Sigma to focus on the continuous improvement of core processes. Since its inception, more than 1,100 employees have completed varying levels of training, and 40 teams around the globe have led projects aimed at driving growth, operational excellence, and profitability. Operational excellence is a continuous journey, and we will continue to connect process improvements directly to our customers' specific requirements. The leadership our employees demonstrate as they plan and execute these projects is an example of our shared leadership strategy in action.

We simplify the supply chain for our customers and suppliers by managing its complexity, enabling them to bring their products to market faster and more profitably.
...powered by Arrow people... Building a strong management team is the cornerstone of our shared leadership strategy. In 2005, we welcomed two executives to our Executive Committee. To drive innovation and integration across our supply chain solutions, we appointed Bhawnesh C. Mathur to the newly created position of Chief Supply Chain Officer. Bhawnesh, former Executive Vice President at Sanmina-SCI, oversees our information technology, logistics, and supply chain solutions functions. J. Edward Coleman, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CompuCom Systems, Inc., joined Arrow as President of Enterprise Computing Solutions. Ed will lead our efforts to build on the success of our North American business and international expansion. Early in 2006, we announced the appointment of Richard S. Hill, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Novellus Systems, Inc., to our Board of Directors. Rick has significant global and industry experience and will be a valuable addition to our Board and its committees. As we welcomed new leaders, we also recognized the contributions of Professor Richard S. Rosenbloom, a longtime Arrow Board member, who retired in 2005. For more than 13 years, Arrow benefited from his counsel and business expertise. On behalf of Arrow's senior management team, I want to thank Professor Rosenbloom for his service. ...with strong traditions for the journey forward. Ethics has long been a part of the fabric of our company. In 2004, we established a Worldwide Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and all Arrow employees annually reaffirm their commitment to the Code. For the third time, in recognition of our commitment to ethics, Arrow was named to the "100 Best Corporate Citizens" listing by Business Ethics magazine. This annual listing recognizes publicly traded U.S. companies that excel at serving stakeholders with excellence and integrity. Powering our journey forward is the talent and energy of our more than 11,000 employees. It is a testament to their commitment that Arrow Electronics was named for the ninth time to Fortune magazine's list of America's Most Admired Companies. In this year's annual report, we want to give you a "behind-the-scenes" look at how they deliver results for our customers and suppliers. In addition to their hard work, our employees generously lent their support in the face of the Indian Ocean tsunami and Hurricane Katrina disasters. Together with Arrow, they raised more than $600,000 for the victims and provided special services to customers and suppliers in the affected areas. Our journey to be the clear number one provider of products, services, and solutions continues in 2006. It is powered by the dedication of our people, our progress toward financial and service excellence, and the significant growth opportunities in the markets we serve.
