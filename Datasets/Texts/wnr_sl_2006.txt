  DEAR FELLOW STOCKHOLDERS
  2006 was a year of very significant growth for our company, both financially and physically. It was also a year of milestones.
On the financial side, we completed our Initial Public Offering and Western Refining, Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the stock symbol “WNR” in January 2006. In the following months, we achieved record, after-tax net income of $ 204.8 million for the year. These record earnings for our company were accomplished through a number of factors, including increased refinery throughput, an emphasis on increased distillate production and greatly improved margins on our asphalt sales.
Physically, our company grew in a number of ways, both in terms of plant assets and in terms of throughput and capacity. This is due in large part to the achievement of six benchmark objectives in 2006:
• Total refinery throughput for 2006 rose 9.1%, to 127,000 barrels per day compared to 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2006 we averaged 137,000 barrels per day of total refinery throughput.
• Our total crude oil processing capacity reached 124,000 barrels per day, an increase of nearly 15% over 2005. In 2007, we will continue to make improvements and seek additional efficiencies.
• We completed the construction of a new ultra low sulfur diesel plant at our El Paso refinery, bringing it online two months ahead of the deadline set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. By year-end, we were producing in excess of 30,000 barrels per day of ultra low sulfur diesel.
• We constructed a new hydrogen plant which greatly enhances our flexibility in the operation of our numerous desulfurization processes. The hydrogen plant began operations in February of 2007.
• In May, 2006, we bought Chevron’s El Paso asphalt plant and asphalt terminals in Phoenix, Tucson and Albuquerque. These assets enabled us to significantly improve the return on our asphalt production.
• During 2006, Kinder Morgan finished the first phase of its East Line expansion project, providing substantial new capacity for refined products to be shipped from El Paso to Tucson and Phoenix. Western increased its shipments to those markets and, consequently, increased our allocation of pipeline capacity on the Kinder Morgan system.
In August of 2006, Western Refining, Inc. tendered an offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Phoenix- based Giant Industries, Inc. While both companies’ boards
of directors and Giant’s shareholders have approved the merger, as of the publication of this annual report, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has announced they will seek to block the merger. Western and Giant plan to vigorously challenge the FTC in court and will continue to work toward completing the merger.
After the merger is completed, Western will be the fourth- largest publicly traded independent oil refiner in the nation. More importantly, the transaction will mean an immediate addition of scale and diversification: three additional refineries, which will bring our total crude oil capacity to over 223,000 barrels per day; three wholesale marketing operations in growing markets; and 155 retail gasoline outlets and convenience stores in New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona. We will increase our overall crude processing capacity by approximately 80%, expand our footprint geographically to include the east coast and the four corners region of the Southwest and diversify our business operations by adding significant wholesale and retail operations. We look forward to finalizing this transaction soon.
Every day, I am grateful for the employees of Western Refining. They are the sole reason for our exceptional, industry-recognized safety record. In 2006, we did not have one recordable lost-time injury. In fact, in November we surpassed 2 million man hours without a recordable injury, a milestone of which we are all very proud. Our employees make Western Refining a safe place to work and a good steward of our natural environment. They are a critically important part of our growth and success and I wish to thank them for their hard work. Additionally, we look forward to welcoming the fine and dedicated employees of Giant to the Western family.
To our shareholders, I would like to thank you for your trust in, and participation with, Western Refining. It is our intent to make every effort to become not only one of the nation’s most successful refining companies, but to be an exceptional corporate citizen in the communities we serve. We believe we have tremendous opportunities in the years to come, and we pledge to do everything possible to capture those opportunities in a responsible, safe manner for the growth of our business.
