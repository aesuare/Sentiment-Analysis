 highlights 2006 was an important year for Office Products – we grew internal sales almost
6 percent after three consecutive years of no growth. Our investments in new products paid off handsomely with several successful launches, including the Paper Mate® Profile® pen, which offers the smooth writing experience of a gel pen without the smearing, and the exceptionally comfortable Paper Mate® Pro-FitTM pen. These and other products and brands received an infusion of strategic investment in 2006, including highly creative print and television advertising on a global basis,
as well as continued support of the Sharpie® 500 and Sharpie® MINI 300 NASCAR® races. In addition, we expanded our product offering into labeling with the integration of the DYMO acquisition. We welcomed the DYMO team into the Newell Rubbermaid family and delivered better than forecasted results through a shared commitment to collaboration and by leveraging our complementary managerial, marketing and operating capabilities. We continue to be excited about the future for DYMO and the ability to expand our leadership position into additional near-neighbor categories.
          highlights These businesses collectively drove 4 percent sales growth in 2006, led by particularly strong growth in Rubbermaid Commercial and Rubbermaid Home. We focused our efforts and investments on gaining a deep understanding of what the consumer wants and delivering products that work. We were recognized frequently during the year for our work. A broad survey of facilities managers gave top honors to Rubbermaid Commercial, and a leading consumer products review publication ranked Rubbermaid Home’s Configurations® closet system #1. We know these accolades are possible only when we’ve first delivered successful innovation to the consumer. Our window fashions business regenerated top line growth by leveraging its strong brand recognition and market presence with its fashion forward window covering designs and drapery hardware offering.
       highlights While the collective sales growth in these businesses was modest in 2006,
our established positions in the commercial and retail markets, backed by investments in job site demonstrations, NASCAR® events and other face-to-face initiatives, drove strong growth in our Irwin and Lenox branded product lines. We focused on end user conversion to our products by showing them firsthand how our Lenox® Diamond saw blades cut cast iron smoother and faster; how the IRWIN® Speedbor® MaxTM bits make drilling larger holes through any surface a snap;
and how Quick-Grip® clamping solutions deliver a powerful hold with the easy pull of a trigger. We also made great strides in collaboration and sharing of expertise among our tools business through a common physical location and emphasis on sharing best practices. Our focus on product innovation, coupled with targeted marketing and the right organizational structure
will drive greater profitability in years to come.
          highlights These businesses generated almost 11 percent sales growth through a strong product lineup backed by a significant increase in advertising and promotion support. Calphalon continued to drive its established position in the bridal registry market, as well as reach out to consumers through targeted television advertising on The Food Network® and on such programs as the Top Chef competition on the Bravo Network.TM Graco continues to serve as a leader in infant safety, and introduced unique products such as the SafeSeatTM and TurboBooster® car seat and travel systems. Goody expanded their Colour CollectionTM and Goody StayPutTM elastic hair bands, while also launching a salon-quality line under the i mTM brand. Goody’s continued sponsorship of numerous girls’ and women’s athletic events, extensive product sampling and sharp eye for the latest fashion trends supported its strong sales growth.

In 2006, we laid out a new vision for Newell Rubbermaid – to
be a global company of Brands That MatterTM known for best-in-class results.
and great people,
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
In 2006, we laid out a new vision for Newell Rubbermaid – to be a global company of Brands That MatterTM and great people, known for best-in-class results. This simple statement has become our guiding light as we transform our business model, strategy and culture to achieve sustainable excellence.
The new business model
is centered around investing in consumer understanding, innovation and successful commercialization to create Brands That Matter.TM
advertising agency to help assess our top brands, field consumer and brand research and identify the training, development and hiring needs necessary to build a top-tier consumer branding company. In the years ahead, we will steadily increase our investment in consumer understanding and demand creation
What you see today is truly a new Newell Rubbermaid. We have moved away from the old business model which embraced company-owned manufacturing in high-cost countries and fiercely independent business units, driven by the requests of retailers. The new business model is centered around investing in consumer understanding, innovation and successful commercialization to create Brands That Matter,TM achieving best cost manufacturing and sourcing, and leveraging the benefits of operating as one company.
Building the company’s consumer-driven branding capabilities is critical to our success and is one of our key transformational strategies. To help develop this expertise, we partnered with a leading global
and integrate these insights into our product development, brand strategy and business planning processes.
Keep in mind, the evolution into best-in-class consumer driven branding will not happen overnight. We have only taken the initial steps. It will take several years to develop our capabilities and begin to realize our full potential. The good news is we are making steady progress and will realize business building benefits every year along the way.
Thanks to the resiliency and hard work of the men
and women of Newell Rubbermaid, 2006 was a watershed year. We demonstrated the ability to exceed all current year commitments while launching several major initiatives that will build long-term capability

and sustainable excellence. For the first time in four years we achieved what I refer to as “the growth trifecta” – simultaneous top line, gross margin and bottom line progress. Sales rose 8.5 percent, almost 5 percent of which was organic; gross margin expanded 260 basis points and operating income increased
17 percent over the prior year. This strong performance was broad-based, with all our segments posting both top and bottom line growth.
During the year we also improved our portfolio, divesting several non-strategic businesses, integrating the DYMO acquisition and significantly increasing the profitability of the Levolor/Kirsch and Rubbermaid Home Products businesses, which were previously classified as “Fix.” We now have a platform of core businesses and brands that can deliver sustainable growth.
We continue to transform our manufacturing and sourcing footprint. Our goal is to achieve best total delivered cost through increased capacity utilization, more production located in low-cost countries and strategic use of third party sourcing. Earlier this year, we expanded the scope of our restructuring initiative, Project Acceleration, to include our distribution

and transportation optimization
efforts. Project Acceleration will
result in $50 million in annualized
savings starting in 2007, rising to
$150 million annually at the
conclusion of the program in 2009.
As I mentioned earlier, operating as one company
is a focus of the new Newell Rubbermaid. Wherever it makes sense, we will be leveraging scale and collaboration across business units to improve efficiency, reduce costs and create synergies. For example, we implemented a shared services center in Europe to handle common financial, human resources and customer business transactions, and we are expanding the scope of our existing shared services center in North America. Later this year we will implement the first stage of our multi-year rollout of SAP®. This enterprise resource platform will enable standard business processes and create cost savings across the company.
Finally, we are transforming our culture to one
that is consumer-centric and brand-focused, where collaboration, teamwork and diversity are core values, and we judge our success against the standard of best-in-class. I know culture change is neither quick nor easy. It requires consistent and persistent
actions over a long period of time. It won’t change because we want it to change. It will be part and parcel of our business model transformation. I am encouraged by the results of a recent employee survey which shows engaged and supportive. Looking
I am confident the growth trend we started in 2006 can and will continue into 2007 and beyond.
our people are
forward, I am confident the growth trend we started in 2006 can and will continue into 2007 and beyond. We have a strong stable of brands operating in markets that are fragmented. Consumption is expandable, not limited by population growth or the economy, and our brands are readily extendable to near neighbor categories. Investment in innovation and marketing, fueled by continued gross margin expansion, will allow us to capture the benefits
of these favorable dynamics. We know that Newell Rubbermaid has what it takes to become best-in-class, and we will continue to invest in its long-term success. Thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,

President & Chief Executive Officer March 28, 2007

 In 2006, we launched Waterman and Parker’s “store-within-a-store” concept to offer consumers the exceptional design and feel of finely crafted writing instruments in a luxury atmosphere. Geographically located in three
of the world’s major fashion epicenters – Paris, Shanghai and London – these highly attractive displays bring these premium brands even closer to the discriminating consumers who often make their final decision at the time of purchase.
 During the year we strategically located and opened Calphalon Kitchen Outlets, which provide a showcase for the cooking novice and the culinary enthusiast alike. Moreover, the centers provide an ability to measure the effectiveness of our branding, retail placement and product features in what we consider a real life and real time consumer research laboratory. This program is yet another example of the execution of our strategy to become
a leader in consumer understanding, innovation and demand creation.

  Shh, don’t wake the baby. An innovative idea from Newell Rubbermaid brings the digital age to the nursery, letting parents see and hear their baby with the clarity of digital video and sound. The new Graco® imonitorTM Digital Color Video Baby Monitor broadcasts in high-resolution color up to 600 feet away, with total privacy due to a special feature that eliminates cross-channel communication. Even better, it’s the first such digital video product on the market.
   a better perspective.
At Newell Rubbermaid, we see a world full of unmet consumer needs. For us, it’s a world
full of opportunities. We continue to align ourselves closer to the marketplaces we serve, closer to the consumers who use Newell Rubbermaid products every day. That connection point, whether it be to new moms or first-time homeowners, is vital. It helps us better understand consumers’ needs. It is the point where virtually every Newell Rubbermaid new product begins.
seeing life through consumers’ eyes.
We value the importance of knowing the needs of our consumers. To gain the best understanding of how our consumers and brands interact, we utilize numerous techniques including focus groups, opinion surveys and on-site observation at retail outlets and job sites. These avenues provide valuable insight on unmet needs and how best to communicate what our brands and products have to offer. The result: more consumer-meaningful products ranging from an ergonomic, better-cutting KatanaTM knife to an “OuchlessTM” hair brush to a fashion-forward baby stroller that provides enough cargo space for today’s multi-tasking mom.
enhancing people’s lives.
Newell Rubbermaid’s products touch consumers in their day-to-day lives – adding convenience, ease and efficiency to life. Our focus is on making our products more relevant and meaningful to consumers throughout the world. We are introducing a steady stream of new ideas, including Calphalon® Enamel Cast Iron cookware, Goody® Styling + TherapyTM brushes, Lenox® Diamond saw blades, Sharpie® Micro markers and many more. Collectively, our products continue to meet consumers’ needs in ways that deliver more value and brand differentiation, helping make Newell Rubbermaid’s brands matter to consumers.

Safety on the go. The most important part of the sleek, Euro-styled Graco® TrekkoTM three-wheel stroller isn’t the stroller. It’s the passenger. Newell Rubbermaid designed the TrekkoTM stroller to provide infants with maximum safety, comfort and fun. From its sturdy wheels to its padded seats and 5-point safety harness, the TrekkoTM stroller helps keep little ones happy and secure.

  Exposing the consumer to a better marker. Pick up the remarkable new dry erase EXPO® marker and experience how comfortable innovation can feel. In one sleek design and available in an array of colors to suit every need, you have a dry erase marker, precision eraser and comfort grip. The idea came from EXPO® marker users themselves – proving, once again, that consumers are often our best collaborators.

The cure for black and white. When it comes to adding more color to the classroom, Sharpie has the right solution. Eight in ten students say words are easier to remember in color. Good thing Sharpie® markers come in forty colors, eighteen tip sizes and twenty- seven product families. From metallic inks to yellow highlighters, ultra-fine tip to chisel point, there’s a Sharpie® marker for just about every classroom application.

  In a class by itself. Consumers want writing instruments that are comfortable and effortless to use. Paper Mate has just the thing – the new Profile® ballpoint pen. With its broad, smooth-flowing 1.4 mm ball and ergonomic rubber grip, the Profile® pen is the “World’s Smoothest Pen.TM” No doubt, that’s why more consumers than ever are turning to the Profile® pen for their everyday writing needs.
    we see a more colorful way to learn.
seeing the big picture.
It’s one thing to identify emerging consumer needs, but quite another to meet them. Here at Newell Rubbermaid, we are working hard every day to do just that. We keep our eyes on the big picture – creating Brands That MatterTM by looking beyond our brands to the people who use them. We’re building a detailed understanding of our target consumers and are incorporating those takeaways into our business processes. Just as important to our success, we recognize the significance of knowing the intricacies of our markets, industries and competitors, and we invest in resources which enable us to gain that deeper understanding.
creating more demand.
At Newell Rubbermaid, meaningful new product development requires true insight into the problems and needs of consumers. We develop unique, innovative products to meet those needs.
In 2006, we shifted our strategy – moving away from a push-through marketing approach towards a pull-through one. We are creating consumer demand for our products in the marketplace. That demand, in turn, “pulls” our products through retail channels. As a result, consumers are aware of our innovative products and ask for them by name. By touching consumers’ lives in more meaningful ways, we are making our brands more visible, accessible and appealing. For example, the successful EXPO® Classroom Makeover Program awards a $25,000 classroom makeover to deserving educators, ensuring that EXPO stays in the hearts and minds of those who use it every day.
the amazing Sharpie® Retractable marker (and how it came to be).
Like the Model T Ford nearly a century ago, when the Sharpie® permanent marker was introduced in 1964, it came in only one color: black. Over the years, the color palette has expanded to forty colors. But that still left one unmet consumer need. Users wanted their favorite permanent marker to retract like a ballpoint pen. The Sharpie® marker design team tackled the problem, engineering an innovative Safety SealTM Valve that seals tight to prevent ink dry-out yet puts no pressure on the tip, preventing wear. Now, users of Sharpie® markers have the same great Sharpie® ink in a retractable marker that allows easy one-handed operation. Best of all, no more lost caps.

   The fastest pliers on earth. Adjusting traditional groove joint pliers can be frustrating. But not the new IRWIN® GrooveLock pliers with patented, precision IRWIN® GrooveLock technology. One touch of the Press-N-Slide button adjusts the lower jaw up to 50 percent faster than traditional pliers. And the added benefit of less hand fatigue, due to the patented comfort handle, makes the professional user’s work easier.

a continuous cycle of improvement.
Innovation doesn’t end with product design at Newell Rubbermaid. In fact, it travels 360 degrees, enhancing everything from R&D to manufacturing to our global supply chain. 360-degree innovation is our driving force, helping us find better ways of providing consumer value and doing business. It’s how we create a best-in-class consumer branding organization.
putting efficiency on the fast track.
The old saying “two heads are better than one” is multiplied manyfold at Newell Rubbermaid. We collaborate across business units in areas such as new product design and sharing best practices. While we implement new ways to add efficiency to our sourcing and manufacturing functions, we’re also speeding up the delivery of new products to our markets – products that also save consumers time and energy. As a result, new product vitality is projected to double from 2004 to 2008.
a portfolio of Brands That Matter.TM
Newell Rubbermaid brands are Brands That Matter,TM for the home, business or commercial marketplaces. They meet consumer needs. For the professional consumer, we offer numerous qualityproductsthathelpgetthejobdonefasterandsafer,includingIRWIN® GrooveLockpliers, the fastest pliers on Earth, the new Lenox® Diamond saw blade, which combines world-class speed and durability, and the WaveBrake® mop bucket, a revolution in cleaning effectiveness.
12
WaveBrake.® Or how we improved the humble mop and pail.
Most commercial mop buckets are prone to splashing due to wave action when moved, creating a slip-and-fall hazard. What’s worse, conventional wringers and mop buckets do not separate clean and dirty water, so, essentially, you are mopping the floor with a bucket full of increasingly dirty water. The WaveBrake® mop bucket and wringer system developed by Rubbermaid Commercial solves those problems. Special baffles reduce splashing by up to 40 percent. There’s a second bucket below the wringer to collect dirty water, which means a safer environment, cleaner floors and improved productivity. What’s more, the wringer lasts up to fifty-eight times longer than comparable wringers, which helps keep money from going down the drain.
 
  Cast iron pipe finally meets its match. Behold the new Lenox® Diamond saw blade – the first blade of its type. Its diamond particle cutting edge is not only more durable than carbon grit blades, it’s faster, up to three times faster when cutting through 4" cast iron pipe. It’s the perfect partner for the busy professional to get the job done effectively.
  we see a cleaner, safer way
to get the job done.

Levolor® sheds light on customer service.
Newell Rubbermaid’s focus on the consumer and on customer service has yielded significant results in our Levolor/Kirsch business unit. We have reduced our delivery for custom blinds and shades to under 14 days across the country. We have simplified a very complex buying process, including enabling consumers to order free swatches online at www.levolor.com. Additionally, our Web site educates visitors about our products and our online Easy Window Checker helps avoid inaccurate measuring. Educating the consumer on how to measure accurately results in significant cost savings.
     a portfolio of Brands That Matter.TM
In 2006, we took a hard look at Newell Rubbermaid’s portfolio. Our focus was on optimizing and strengthening the portfolio by investing in businesses we felt would be a strategic fit with the goals of the company as a whole, have strong brand equity, are receptive to innovation, and are synergistic with the family of brands and the company – these are only a few of the factors taken under close consideration when evaluating an acquisition opportunity. A recent acquisition, DYMO, is a good example of that. A strong, innovative company with global growth potential, DYMO is a good fit with our Office Products group.
During 2006, we divested businesses that did not have a strategic fit, including Home Décor Europe, Little Tikes and Newell Cookware Europe. The businesses that remain in our portfolio today represent a core from which we can grow. While we regularly assess and fine-tune our portfolio, the existing businesses no longer need special attention and as such, there is no longer a need to report fix and invest business splits. We will continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions in order to supplement our organic growth.
we see fashion in a whole new light.
A finial that speaks to you. Each year, the Kirsch design team identifies new home décor trends and translates them into new drapery hardware styles. For example, recognizing consumers’ desire for self expression, Kirsch developed the Mix & MatchTM collection, which features contemporary hardware designs in eclectic materials – leather, metal, glass, wood and mother of pearl. They’re sure to spark personal inspiration.

getting the details right.
In business, there’s no escaping “the details” – those tedious, time-consuming tasks that fill up the day. Developing tools to handle those tasks more efficiently is a growing opportunity for Newell Rubbermaid, especially in the Small Office/Home Office market. Our brands help in a variety of ways, from addressing mailing labels to capturing information from business cards to organizing a desktop.
putting Newell Rubbermaid to work.
Anyone who’s ever stood in a long line at the post office, waiting to buy stamps or mail a package, knows what a time-waster that can be, especially if you run your own business. Newell Rubbermaid introduced an easy alternative: the next generation in the DYMO family, DYMO Stamps.TM It’s the first no-monthly fee postage printing service, and is approved by
the United States Postal Service. All it takes is a DYMO® LabelWriter® printer and a PC or Mac.
Newell Rubbermaid acquired DYMO, a strong, recognized global leader in the on-demand labeling market in November 2005. The subsequent introduction of DYMO StampsTM software set the pace for future innovations and brand extensions. In 2006, we further strengthened our Office Products group by acquiring CardScan – a leader in desktop contact management solutions. Strategy-wise, DYMO StampsTM software and CardScan® desktop scanners are perfect complements. Both help small business owners stay more productive and organized.

driving best-in-class cost.
The business model is changing. We are elevating the role of our brands. We are leveraging the power of “One Newell Rubbermaid” as we become a center-led enterprise. And we are moving to a best-in-class cost structure.
The journey to achieving best-in-class sourcing and manufacturing began in 2001 with the announcement of a three-year restructuring plan. The plan was completed in 2004 and provided $145 million in annual savings. In 2005, the Company launched a strategic global initiative known as Project Acceleration, which was designed to achieve an optimal balance between manufacturing and sourcing and between low- and high-cost countries. Project Acceleration also involves optimizing the Company’s distribution network and leveraging the Company’s scale to drive productivity. The project is expected to be completed in 2009 with annual savings in excess of $150 million.

 Getting organized the easy way. Finally, busy Small Office/Home Office business people can throw out those stacks of old business cards they’ve been saving. A quick pass through the sleek, compact CardScan® desktop card scanner and each card’s content is instantly and accurately captured electronically. The contacts can then be printed on DYMO® labels or synchronized with most contact management programs and mobile devices.

  Organization is at your fingertips. The new DYMO® portable label maker is what office efficiency is all about. But don’t let its compact size mislead you. It has a 100-character memory, prints up to two lines vertically or horizontally, has a large 13-character display and prints two label widths: 3/8" (9 mm) and 1/2" (12 mm).
 we see a more efficient home office.
Bring order to your hectic day. Put a DYMO® label maker on your desk and you’ll wonder how you ever survived without one. DYMO is a brand leader in the on-demand label market. DYMO® label printers print everything from file labels to mailing labels. The DYMOTM Desktop Mailing Solution package includes DYMO StampsTM software and a postage scale that handles up to 5 lbs. with ease, reducing trips to the post office – saving valuable time.

 RETIREMENT
                                  Calphalon is there with the tools at hand. Due in part to Calphalon’s effective advertising campaigns, including presence and partnership with The Food Network,® more consumers than ever are experiencing the joys of cooking. And 78 million baby boomers are looking at retirement as a time to try new things.
you see a pan...
 The right tool for the job. The Calphalon® line of kitchen gadgets will be designed to do one thing: work hard so you don’t have to. Tenderizing meat, cutting a pizza or coring an apple – just a few tasks our gadgets make simple. That’s because each tool in the Calphalon® collection incorporates a soft touch control zone positioned close to the tool head, where the hand naturally falls and applies the most pressure.

seared to perfection – Calphalon® anodized cookware.
It’s been a long-standing cook’s dilemma. If your recipe calls for searing (cooking the surface of the food at high temperature to form a crust), some of the food was going to stick to the pan’s surface, making the pan hard to clean. Newell Rubbermaid’s material science team went to work on the problem. Through an exclusive, patent-pending anodization process, interior and exterior surfaces of the pan are infused with an advanced polymer. The infused anodized cooking surface offers exceptional searing and browning. Foods also lift more easily from the infused anodized surface than from a traditional anodized surface. Infused anodized cookware offers unmatched durability and versatility – so it’s safe for stove-top, oven and broiler use. Small wonder anodized sales rose 20 percent in 2006, backed by a high impact advertising campaign.
    something’s cooking in the kitchen.
Teach people to enjoy cooking and provide the tools that make it easy and enjoyable – they’ll spend more time doing it.
Calphalon is quickly evolving from a cookware brand into a broader lifestyle brand that includes cutlery, baking equipment, utensils and textiles. Our Calphalon Culinary Center is teaching friends, families and even business groups the joy of cooking and the culinary arts.
one world. one Newell Rubbermaid.
At Newell Rubbermaid we understand the difference between an international company and a global one. So, we are doing more than selling our products around the world. We are establishing a strategic global presence, complete with operations, manufacturing and marketing facilities. We are beginning to design products for global markets, while also understanding the regional preferences of the consumer. While North America represents approximately 80 percent of our current net sales, regions outside of North America continue to grow in importance and offer a solid base from which to build. The projected growth in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America is expected to significantly outpace the growth in North America. Our opportunities are endless.
We are collaborating across business units in important areas such as new product design and sharing best practices. We are cross-pollinating ideas and processes through teamwork. We are all part of a single culture. We are one Newell Rubbermaid.

Where have all the lids gone? The new line of high-end Rubbermaid® PremierTM containers solves two unmet consumer needs. First is the problem of missing lids. Nearly 75 percent of consumers say they have trouble finding lids to match their food storage containers. Second is the problem of stained containers, the number one reason why consumers throw them out. Rubbermaid® PremierTM containers are made of polycarbonate, which has the clarity of glass, washing after washing. And the lids snap to each base, and then nest together neatly.
