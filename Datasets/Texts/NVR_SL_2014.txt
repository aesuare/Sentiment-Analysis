 To our ShareholderS
In 2014, the housing industry continued to benefit from historically low mortgage rates and an improving employment picture. However, constrained mortgage availability, slowing price appreciation and cost input pressures all weighed on 2014 results. These headwinds serve as a reminder that homebuilding is a cyclical industry. While we believe that we are still in the recovery stage of the cycle, the recovery has been, and will continue to be uneven. In 2014, we achieved the following results:
• Homebuilding revenues were $4.4 billion (up 6% vs. 2013)
• Net income was $281.6 million (up 6% vs. 2013)
• Diluted earnings per share of $63.50 (up 16% vs. 2013)
• New orders were 12,389 (up 5% vs. 2013)
• Year-end backlog of 5,475 units, with a dollar value of $2.1 billion (up 14% vs. 2013)
At NVR, we recognize that our success starts with our focus on the customer. We continually strive to exceed our customers’ expectations through all stages of their home purchase, including helping to navigate their financing options, building a quality home and standing behind our product after the sale. We take great pride in our reputation as a company that places the customer first. Treating our customers this way is important and the only way we do business.
In addition to our customer focus, our proven business model differentiates us from our competitors. Our asset-light business model is designed to emphasize liquidity and minimize risk. Unlike our major competitors, we avoid developing land and speculative building. Instead, we focus on our strength, which is selling and building quality homes. We acquire finished lots at market prices from reliable local developers under fixed price purchase agreements. We typically purchase lots on a just-in-time basis, after we have sold homes on these lots. The liquidity generated by this strategy has resulted in lower capital requirements, higher returns on capital, and the financial flexibility to take advantage of new opportunities as they arise.
Our continued success is also a direct result of our commitment to a proven business strategy that focuses on being the dominant builder in each of the markets we serve. We believe that local market scale resulting from this strategy allows us to leverage our existing employees, management staff, local market knowledge, and relationships with business partners. Local market scale is also a crucial part of our strategy to maintain a low cost structure and maximize returns on investment.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 We are proud of the performance of our employees, subcontractors, developers, and suppliers. They are instrumental in our continued success and we would like to thank them for their remarkable efforts this year. Their ongoing commitment is a key component of NVR’s industry leading performance.
As we look forward to 2015, we are excited about what the future holds. Although challenges remain, we believe that low mortgage rates and strong affordability make now a great time to buy a new home. With our proven business model, dedicated team of employees and business partners and our focus on customer service, we are confident that NVR will continue to outperform the industry and look forward to another successful year.
Sincerely,
Dwight C. Schar Chairman of the Board
