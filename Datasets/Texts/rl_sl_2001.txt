Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer

DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
Fiscal 2001 was a strong year and I am proud of our success. We continued to strengthen our business and expand Polo Ralph Lauren worldwide. And we did it by following the philosophy we founded this company on 34 years ago -- product, concept and leadership. Our record results show that, in increasing numbers, customers want to be part of the Polo Ralph Lauren lifestyle. They know what we stand for and they share our values. Experts might call this branding, a term that seems to have lost much of its meaning. Instead, I prefer to call it "bonding" -- a bond of trust we've earned from our 34-year commitment to quality, sophistication and style. We are more excited than ever about our business. And I see that same passion in the eyes of our 10,000 employees, who have been energized by our achievements over the past year -- and I owe them countless thanks. This spirit will drive our great company to achieve even greater things. As we look back on the year, one accomplishment stands out -- our ability to marry our world-class design and marketing capabilities with equally strong business processes. So, in addition to being known for our skill in bringing innovative products to market, we are building a reputation for delivering consistent operating results. We've reached this goal by adding new talent to our team and refocusing our existing talent. Companies are about teams. No one person can do it. I can offer leadership, but it takes the team to make it happen. Roger Farah joined Polo as President and Chief Operating Officer a little over a year ago. Roger is a strong leader with the ability to make things happen. As head of Polo Ralph Lauren operations, Roger has helped to take our design and marketing-driven company and support it with a world-class structure that has produced world-class results in the past year. With Roger focused on day-to-day operations, I asked Lance Isham, our Vice Chairman, to assume responsibility for our European expansion and the management of our businesses in key international markets. Lance, who has worked with me for two decades, has been instrumental in building the Polo Ralph Lauren business. He understands my vision and performs a key role in positioning Polo as a global player with diverse brands.

We've added depth to our organization through new senior executives in Finance, Global Logistics, Human Resources and a new leader for our Club Monaco business. The result is the strongest and most talented management group in the industry. In addition to adding talent to our organization, we added new expertise to our Board of Directors. We are delighted that Judith A. McHale, President and Chief Operating Officer of Discovery Communications, Inc., joined our board in February and Dr. Joyce F. Brown, President of the Fashion Institute of Technology, was appointed to our board last month. Both directors add important new voices to our board and we believe they will be tremendous assets to our Company. While our business evolves, our principles remain firm. Rather than chasing the winds of "what's hot and what's not," we remain committed to capturing the timeless, appealing elements of the American lifestyle in our designs and our global marketing. The Polo concept of luxury is built on an enduring belief in living with style and quality. Guided by these ideals, we will continue to grow by expanding our breadth and reach in the U.S. and worldwide. This includes broadening our luxury product portfolio and increasing our focus on our full-line retail stores which have the greatest power to market these products to our customers. We see an excellent opportunity to expand our operations internationally, particularly in Europe, where our brands already enjoy widespread recognition and the demand for our products is growing. Entering our 35th year, I see tremendous opportunities on a global scale. I believe we have only begun to explore Polo Ralph Lauren's true potential, as we continue to drive the same level of excellence from our business operations that we receive from our design studio. My colleagues and I look forward to sharing our progress with you in the months and years ahead.
