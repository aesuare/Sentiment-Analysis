                     TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:
We are pleased to report that, despite a fairly severe freight recession in 2007, J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. posted the Company’s sixth consecutive year of record revenues and fourth consecutive full-year operating ratio below 90%. These accomplishments were the result of our dedicated family of employees, who strive each day to deliver impeccable customer service while achieving an excellent return on invested capital and all the while maintaining an unwavering focus on SAFETY.
Highlights for calendar year 2007:
• Annual revenues increased 5% to a record $3.49 billion
• 76% of our revenue and 91% of our operating income was generated by something other than asset-based truckload services
• Operating income decreased only slightly, by 1%, to $369 million
• Earnings per share improved by more than 7%
• Return on invested capital was 18%
• Dividends to our stockholders increased from $0.08 per share in 2006 to $0.09 in January 2007 and an additional quarterly increase to $0.10
in February 2008
• Stock repurchase programs totaled $603.4 million or 21.7 million shares
• Company-owned truck and tractor fleet decreased to 10,308 units from 10,961 units
• Container fleet grew to 34,019 from 27,622
For several years now, we have stressed the evolution of our diversified business model and our strategy to shift from primarily an asset-based truckload carrier to an asset-light transportation company. In 2007, we saw tremendous progress toward that goal. Our industry-leading Intermodal segment grew its container fleet by 23%, while also improving productivity through velocity and reducing our reliance on third-party equipment and dray. Intermodal accounted for 47% of our total revenue in 2007 and was a key differentiator in our service offerings. We believe that our customers continue to view our Intermodal service as a more economical and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional over-the-road transportation. This was especially evident in the growth of our volumes in the eastern half of the country.
The Dedicated Contract Services (DCS) segment maintained its position as the largest provider of dedicated service in the country. A slight reduction in the fleet size was primarily driven by the reduction of generic capacity fleets that migrated back to one-way, random truckload movement, as pricing in that mode of transport became more competitive. We have intensified and reiterated our strategy to pursue value-added, truly dedicated business through our efforts to bring more highly customized offerings to customers using specialized equipment types and driver services.
In the first quarter 2007, we began reporting our Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS) business segment separately, which was previously included in the Truck segment. ICS provides non-asset and asset-light transportation solutions to customers through relationships with third-party carriers and integration with company-owned equipment. Although still in its infancy, this segment saw significant growth in 2007, with a 119% increase in revenue and 28% higher operating income over the same period in 2006. The second half of the year saw operating income start to surpass the prior year as costs incurred to accelerate the growth began to be absorbed. In addition, our third-party carrier base grew 32% during the fourth quarter to more than 8,500 carriers by year-end.
The year proved to be one of the most difficult for our Truck segment, primarily due to one of the worst freight recessions in memory. We reduced our fleet size 23% by the end of the year, as we attempted to “right-size” the fleet in relation to customer requirements and return-on-investment targets. This plan allowed us to begin the year with tractor counts more adequately aligned with anticipated demand.
Since our early, humble beginnings, the Company has always displayed an entrepreneurial spirit. That mindset still permeates the Company today as we continue to redefine ourselves and further diversify our customer service offerings. To compensate for the historically cyclical nature of the truckload industry, this more attractive investment model minimizes dependence on one segment. Equipped with our proprietary Customer Value Delivery® methodology and award-winning technologies, which enable better processes, we will continue to see new and inventive ways to give back to our employees, shareholders, customers and the environment.
We sincerely appreciate your continued support and we pledge to continue to seek ways to enhance your investment.
