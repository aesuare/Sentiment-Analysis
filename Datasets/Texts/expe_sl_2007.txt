As impressive as these growth rates are for a company of Expedia's scale, we are even more pleased with how broad-based our progress was. Our flagship Expedia.com» rebounded from declining transaction growth in 2006 to post mid-single digit growth in 2007 despite a fiercely competitive market. Our Hotwire» brand, focused on providing travelers great air, hotel & car deals they won't find anywhere else, overcame a diminishing top-line in 2006 to grow its revenue over 60% in 2007. International markets continue to be an increasingly important part of the Expedia» story, with gross bookings outside the U.S. growing nearly 40% in 2007. By the fourth quarter our international websites accounted for 33% of Expedia's bookings, up from 22% just two years ago. In 2007 alone our brands expanded into Austria, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, New Zealand and Turkey. These markets will take some time to scale and achieve profitability; however, we believe that establishing a broad global presence can build lasting moats around our businesses. While international diversification is important for any business, it is even more so for travel companies. Why is that? Well, for starters, the amount of travel spend outside the U.S. is enormous -- Europeans alone spent over $300 billion on travel in 2007, nearly 20% more than United States travelers. International expansion also allows Expedia to enhance the breadth and depth of our supply base while bringing ever more travelers to our travel marketplace. We now offer hoteliers demand from dozens of countries, and we offer travelers their choice of nearly 80,000 hotel properties spanning the globe. A key driver of growth in 2007 was removing barriers to purchase for our travelers. There were many examples of this, but some of the most important were removing change & cancel fees at Hotels.com», reducing or eliminating air booking fees and improving hotel pricing on our European websites, eliminating air booking fees at Hotwire and expanding our ThankYou loyalty program, now serving 1.5 million members. We'll continue to rigorously evaluate our traveler value proposition, remaining open to changes in our business model to enhance that value and build long-term loyalty. In last year's Annual Letter to Stockholders we introduced Expedia's new mission statement: We get the world going...by building the world's largest and most intelligent travel marketplace. To our way of thinking, being a "marketplace" goes beyond our core role of intelligently matching disaggregated supply and demand to drive profitable travel transactions. It also means providing global platforms for both travel and non-travel advertisers to reach our traveler audience. The most obvious example of our advertising strategy at work is the TripAdvisor» Media Network. The core of the Network is TripAdvisor.comTM and its six European websites, which leverage over 15 million reviews and opinions contributed from millions of real travelers across the world. We meaningfully expanded the Network in 2007 and early 2008 through the acquisition of several leading content sites, including airfarewatchdog.comTM, bookingbuddy.comTM, cruisecritic.com TM, holidaywatchdog.comTM, seatguru.comTM, smartertravel.comTM, travel-library.comTM and travelpod.comTM. These media properties are first and foremost about compelling expert and user-generated content. But these sites also provide airlines, hoteliers, car rental companies, cruiselines, package providers, travel bureaus,

tourist attractions and travel agents -- including Expedia and our competitors -- access to millions of engaged travelers. The more subtle -- but equally important -- part of our advertising strategy is taking place at our worldwide points of sale. While Expedia, Hotels.com and their international counterparts are rightly focused on doing everything they can to improve conversion of shoppers into buyers, we are also seeking to do a much better job monetizing the 90+% of travelers (tens of millions per month!) who visit our sites but don't end up purchasing from us for one reason or another. Our advertising and media businesses grew 93% in 2007, delivering $183 million in high margin revenue and accounting for 7% of Expedia's total revenue. We have a ton of work left to do on the media side of the house, with a number of initiatives underway for 2008 and beyond. But we're excited by the significant opportunity this area represents. Airlines, hoteliers and car rental companies alone spend over $5 billion on advertising every year in the U.S. And while over 50% of U.S. travel is purchased online, just 8% of travel advertising is directed to the internet. We expect this gap to narrow over time, presenting an attractive opportunity for this portion of Expedia's global marketplace. In closing, 2007 was a very successful year for Expedia, and we enter 2008 on sounder footing than ever. But we're also well aware of the significant uncertainty surrounding the economy and the consumer. We'll remain mindful of conditions as they evolve, and course correct as warranted. At the same time, it's important for investors to understand we are managing Expedia for more than the next quarter or the next year. The travel industry has substantial online runway, and we are committed to driving sustained growth in long-term shareholder value by investing in the travel brands of choice for travelers, suppliers, and -- increasingly -- advertisers. Thank you for your continued interest in, and support of, Expedia, Inc. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2008. Sincerely, Sincerely,

Barry Diller Chairman & Senior Executive

(1) "OIBA" (Operating income before amortization), is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Please see "Definition of OIBA" and "Reconciliation of OIBA to Operating Income and Net Income" on pages 44 and 45 of this Annual Report. (2) "Free Cash Flow" is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it represents the operating cash flow that our operating businesses generate, less capital expenditures but before taking into account other cash movements that are not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses, such as financing activities or certain investing activities. Free Cash Flow has certain limitations in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor does it represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Free Cash Flow along with the consolidated statements of cash flows.
