Review of 2002
During 2002 we achieved a number of important successes:
• We met our goal of delivering results on exploration opportunities in Equatorial Guinea obtained in the Triton acquisition. We discov- ered the Ebano, Akom and Abang Fields, and made a potentially significant discovery with the G-13 well, all of which will be further appraised. We discovered the Elon Field, which will be developed.
• We were successful in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico where the Shenzi Field was discovered and the Llano Field was successfully appraised. Appraisal of the Shenzi discovery is planned for the second quarter of 2003. Resources discovered in 2002 in the Gulf of Mexico and Equatorial Guinea will begin to be added to our proved reserve base when development plans are finalized.
• We submitted development plans for the Okume, Oveng and Elon Fields to the Government of Equatorial Guinea and expect approval in the second quarter of 2003. Development of the Llano Field has begun.
•We continued to upgrade our portfolio of assets. We sold exploration and production assets for $268 million, including our United Kingdom energy marketing business for $165 million and smaller properties in the United States, United Kingdom and Azerbaijan. We also sold our U.S. flag vessels for $140 million.
• We agreed to exchange our equity interest in Premier Oil plc for a 23% interest in the Natuna A Field in Indonesia, adding low cost, long life reserves.
• The HOVENSA refinery joint venture completed construction of a 58,000 barrel per day coking unit, allowing the refinery to process lower cost, heavy Venezuelan crude oil, thereby enhancing profit margins.
• We reduced debt by $673 million, exceeding our $600 million debt reduction target.
We also experienced some disappointments:
• Production averaged 451,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, the highest in the Corporation’s history, but below our target of 475,000. This shortfall was caused primarily by natural declines from mature fields in the United States and the United Kingdom and reduced production from the Ceiba Field in Equatorial Guinea.
• We took a $530 million after-tax impairment charge on the Ceiba Field reflecting an extended production profile and a reduction in probable reserves and a $256 million after-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of several Gulf of Mexico fields, reflecting reduced reserves.
• Total proved reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis declined to 1.2 billion barrels from 1.4 billion barrels at year-end 2001. The decline was caused by negative revisions, reductions in entitle- ment reserves covered by production sharing contracts due to high year-end commodity prices and asset sales.
• Refining and marketing earnings declined to $40 million in 2002 from $235 million in 2001, due to poor refining margins, a warm winter and narrow retail gasoline margins.
Results of Operations
Amerada Hess reported a net loss of $218 million for 2002, including after-tax charges of $769 million for special items. Operating income was $551 million for 2002, versus $945 million in 2001. Details appear under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition beginning on page 14.
Strategic Plan
Our long-term strategic plan is focused on reshaping our portfolio of assets to enhance financial performance and provide long-term profitable growth. Exploration and production will be the engine of future income and growth, currently representing more than 72% of our capi- tal employed and over 90% of our average annual capital expenditures.
TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS:
“Our long-term strategic plan is focused on reshaping our portfolio of assets to enhance financial performance and provide long-term profitable growth.”

We will continue to increase reserves outside the mature regions of the United States and North Sea. We are confident that the significant increase in new field developments, a more focused, higher impact exploration program and sales of lower value, mature properties will lower our unit costs of production and increase our reserves to production life, strengthening future profitability.
In refining and marketing, we will maximize financial returns from the HOVENSA refinery joint venture and our retail and energy marketing operations on the East Coast of the United States. We will continue to selectively expand our HESS EXPRESS convenience store network.
2003 Priorities
Our priorities in 2003 are:
• Financial Strength We will continue to reduce debt and strengthen our financial position.
• Developments Our capital expenditures will focus on oil and gas field developments. Over $900 million, more than 60% of our estimated $1.475 billion of capital expenditures in 2003, is for developments. This reflects a major shift from an average of about 37% during the past three years (excluding acquisitions). These new, lower cost developments will improve profitability and provide future cash flow.
•Exploration Wewilldrillapproximately20explorationwellsinhigh impact basins in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Southeast Asia. We are optimistic that the results of this program will build upon our 2002 success.
• Upgrade Producing Portfolio We completed a swap of mature Colombian oil and gas properties for an additional 25% interest in long life natural gas reserves in the Joint Development Area (JDA) of Malaysia and Thailand increasing our working interest to 50%. The JDA meets our performance objectives of total unit costs below $12 per barrel of oil equivalent and a reserve life of more than 10 years. The JDA has the potential for significant further additions to proved reserves and production once more natural gas is contracted. Contracts for the construction of the pipeline and gas plant are expected to be authorized in the second quarter of 2003. Potential asset sales in 2003 for properties in the United States, the United Kingdom and Indonesia will continue reshaping our portfolio.
• Refining and Marketing We will improve financial performance from our refining and marketing business. Thus far in the first quarter of 2003, our HOVENSA refinery joint venture and energy marketing operations have been very profitable as a result of a cold winter and historically low refined product inventories.
Corporate Governance
At Amerada Hess, we stress the importance of maintaining high ethical standards. Our corporate governance structure already meets most of the initiatives proposed by the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange. We have established Board and internal committees to assure that we maintain the highest standards of conduct.
As we move further into the international arena, we remain cognizant of the importance of being a good corporate citizen, a reliable partner and a socially responsible corporation. We remain committed to our tradition of making positive contributions to the communities in which we do business.
Recently, two new members were elected to our Board of Directors. Craig Matthews has had extensive operating and financial experience as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, as President and as Chief Financial Officer of both KeySpan Corporation and its predecessor, Brooklyn Union Corporation. Ernst von Metzsch served for many years as Senior Vice President and a Partner of Wellington Management Company and was Manager of the Vanguard Energy Fund and the Vanguard Wellington Fund. He brings a depth of knowledge of the worldwide energy industry and financial markets to the Board. We wel- come both of them.
Three outstanding members of the Board of Directors, Roger B. Oresman, Peter S. Hadley and Robert F. Wright have retired after a long tenure as Directors. During his 34 years as a Director and 45 years of association with Amerada Hess, Mr. Oresman contributed his sophisticated legal knowledge of corporate and financial matters. Mr. Hadley brought extensive financial expertise to the Board during his 12 years as a Director. In his 22 years as a Director and 40 years of extraordinary service, including his role as President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Wright provided exemplary leadership and dedication. We will miss their advice and many invaluable contributions.
We are grateful to our employees for their commitment and achievements. We thank our Directors for their advice and guidance. We express our appreciation to our stockholders for their support.
