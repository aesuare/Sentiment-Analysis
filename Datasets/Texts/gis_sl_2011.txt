To Our Shareholders

Ken Powell
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

I'm pleased to report that General Mills achieved good sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2011. Our results met the key targets we had set for the year, and represented performance consistent with our long-term growth model. The company's progress in 2011 extended a strong record of business growth in recent years. Net sales for the fiscal year ended May 29, 2011, grew 2 percent to reach $14.9 billion. Segment operating profit rose 4 percent to exceed $2.9 billion. And diluted earnings per share (EPS) increased 20 percent to $2.70. The EPS comparison included changes in mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions in both years, as well as certain tax items that resulted in a net earnings benefit in 2011 and a charge in 2010. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes these items from both years, grew 8 percent to $2.48. We were generally pleased with these results because fiscal 2011 presented a truly challenging environment for food manufacturers. Widespread price promotion took place across the food industry for much of last year. Costs for food ingredients and energy, which had moderated in the prior year, began rising again and the cost inflation accelerated as the year went on. In addition, consumers in developed markets remained cautious in a still uncertain economic environment. Results for our U.S. Retail segment reflected these challenges, with net sales of $10.2 billion essentially matching year-ago levels and operating profit of $2.3 billion declining 2 percent from record performance in 2010. However, we posted sales increases on a number of key businesses, including Nature Valley and Fiber One grain snacks, Progresso ready-to-serve soup, Old El Paso Mexican foods, and our Small Planet Foods line of organic

and natural products. Sales for Big G ready-to-eat cereals declined slightly, along with sales for the U.S. cereal category overall. But we maintained our share of cereal category sales in ACNielsen-measured channels, and our market share grew on an all-channel basis. Our Bakeries and Foodservice segment, which competes primarily in U.S. channels for food eaten away from home, soundly outpaced industry trends. Net sales for this business segment grew 6 percent to $1.8 billion. This included 3 percent growth in sales to foodservice distributors and an 11 percent increase in sales to convenience store customers. Segment operating profit rose 16 percent to exceed the $300 million mark for the first time in company history. Our International segment results were strong across the board. Net sales rose 7 percent to nearly $2.9 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, constant-currency net sales grew in each of the four regions where we compete, including gains of 7 percent in Europe and 9 percent in the Asia/Pacific region. International segment operating profit totaled $291 million, up sharply from the prior year that included negative effects from Venezuelan currency devaluation and other foreign exchange items. Excluding foreign exchange effects, profit still grew at a double-digit rate. Our Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) and HäagenDazs Japan (HDJ) joint ventures contributed a combined $96 million in after-tax earnings in 2011. Combined CPW and HDJ net sales, which are not consolidated in General Mills' results, rose 4 percent led by higher sales for CPW.

As shown in the chart above, over the past four fiscal years General Mills has delivered a double-digit compound annual return to shareholders -- superior performance in a volatile and challenging period for the equity market overall. As we enter our next phase of growth, we are targeting continued good sales and earnings performance in the years ahead. It seems clear that food manufacturers will have to contend with higher -- and more volatile -- input costs. In our case, total supply chain cost inflation was 4 percent in 2011, and we've estimated 10 to 11 percent inflation in our plans for 2012. There are multiple factors contributing to this inflationary pressure, but the fundamental driver is growth of emerging markets and their increased demand for food ingredients and energy. We adopted a new business model several years ago to help us manage higher inflation. This model begins with Holistic Margin Management (HMM), our discipline of using productivity, mix and price realization to offset inflation and protect our gross margin. A strong gross margin gives us the ability to fund continued high levels of investment in product improvements, new product development, sales capabilities and consumer marketing. These activities fuel net sales growth and ultimately, growth in earnings. We believe this HMM-driven business model has worked very well in recent years. As you can see in the charts on page 5, it enabled us to protect and expand gross margin over a five-year period when our input cost inflation averaged between 4 and 5 percent. We expect HMM to help us achieve continuing high-quality sales and earnings growth as we go forward.

*Does not include the impact of foreign currency translation. See page 86 of our 2011 Annual Report for a reconciliation to reported results.

In total, General Mills results in fiscal 2011 represented continuing growth on top of strong performance in recent years. Since 2007, General Mills net sales have grown at a 5 percent compound rate. Our segment operating profit has grown even faster, compounding at 7 percent per year. And our adjusted diluted EPS (this measure excludes certain items affecting comparability of results) has increased at a 12 percent compound rate. Our good financial performance was reflected in price appreciation for General Mills stock in fiscal 2011. In addition, dividends per share grew 17 percent last year. In total, stock price appreciation plus dividends generated a 14 percent return to our shareholders for the year. This lagged the very strong returns posted by our peer group and the broader market in 2011. However, our 14 percent return followed a 43 percent return to GIS shareholders in the previous year.

We remain committed to our long-term growth model, which is outlined in the following table: General Mills Long-term Growth Model
Growth Factor Net Sales Segment Operating Profit Earnings per Share Dividend Yield Total Return to Shareholders Compound Annual Growth Target Low single-digit Mid single-digit High single-digit 2 to 3 percent Double-digit

On July 1, 2011, we completed the purchase of a controlling interest in Yoplait SAS, headquartered in France. Sodiaal, the leading French dairy cooperative, will hold the remaining interest. We intend to work together with Sodiaal to build the Yoplait brand in existing markets and expand to new markets worldwide. We plan to consolidate this business, which will increase our reported sales and operating profit in 2012. We expect the 2012 EPS contribution from Yoplait's operating results will be offset by some incremental amortization expense and by the effect on EPS of our decision to buy back fewer shares this year to pay for this acquisition with cash. Beyond 2012, we anticipate that Yoplait will be an important source of earnings growth for General Mills. In fact, international business expansion is one of our five key growth drivers. The other four are: partnering effectively with our retail and foodservice customers; building our brands through strong levels of consumer marketing; protecting and expanding margins; and generating strong levels of product innovation. Of these, innovation is the most powerful lever: It drives growth for our categories and growth in our sales, earnings and market share. We've got a high level of innovation planned across our businesses in 2012. And our innovation and marketing efforts are focused on four big and growing consumer groups: the millennial generation, ages 17 to 34; the baby boomer generation, ages 50 and over; U.S. multicultural consumers; and rising middle-class consumers in emerging global markets. You can read about many of our product and marketing initiatives in the following pages of this report.

Our targets for fiscal 2012 differ from this long-term model due to two primary factors: a sharp increase in estimated input costs, and our acquisition of a controlling interest in the international Yoplait yogurt business. Our business plans before any impact from the Yoplait acquisition assume 10 to 11 percent input cost inflation for fiscal 2012, driven by higher costs for food ingredients and energy. We expect our HMM discipline of productivity, mix management and price realization to offset most, but not all, of this cost pressure. As a result, we are estimating a decline in our gross margin for the year, and we expect segment operating profit growth and earnings per share growth will be below our long-term targets. Net sales are expected to grow at a mid single-digit rate in 2012, driven by price realization and a strong lineup of new products and marketing initiatives.
