   GREG C. GARLAND
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
MARCH 2016
To Our Shareholders,
Phillips 66 achieved major project development milestones during 2015 while sustaining a high level of operating excellence.
 Thanks to our 14,000 dedicated employees, we performed well in 2015, both financially and operationally. Our company delivered
a 14 percent return on capital employed (ROCE), returned $2.7 billion of capital
to shareholders, invested $5.8 billion in
its future, including a $1.5 billion equity contribution to DCP Midstream, and generated adjusted earnings of $4.2 billion, up 11 percent over the prior year.
Despite volatile global energy markets, Phillips 66 is maintaining its approach to capital allocation and continues to execute its strategy. With four integrated businesses,
a diverse portfolio of assets and resilient cash flow, Phillips 66 is able to capitalize on investment opportunities across the value chain.
Our most important focus remains operating excellence, which drives
us to continuously improve in safety, environmental stewardship, reliability
and cost efficiency. In 2015, Phillips 66 achieved first-quartile performance for both combined total recordable rate and lost workday case rate. We are determined to be the industry’s safest, most reliable and efficient company.

 STRATEGIC PLATFORMS
In Midstream, we completed significant strategic projects while creating new platforms for growth. Our Chemicals business continued its expansion, capturing the benefit of low-cost petrochemical feedstocks. Driven by strong market conditions, Refining delivered its best earnings performance since 2012. Marketing and Specialties posted healthy earnings, capitalizing on favorable global margins.
Midstream, the primary focus of the company’s growth, consists of our natural gas liquids (NGL) and transportation businesses, Phillips 66 Partners (our master limited partnership), and a
50 percent interest in DCP Midstream, one of the nation’s largest natural gas processors and NGL producers.
TOTAL RECORDABLE RATES
(Incidents per 200,000 hours worked)
In 2015, Midstream generated $248 million of adjusted earnings. With new organic growth projects now online and others starting up later in 2016 and 2017, we expect to significantly increase Midstream’s earnings by 2018.
Phillips 66 Partners owns, operates, develops and acquires fee-based crude
oil, refined petroleum products, and NGL pipelines, terminals and other facilities. The partnership provides a cost-efficient way to fund growth in Midstream infrastructure.
At year-end, Phillips 66 owned a 69 percent limited partner interest in Phillips 66 Partners as well as the 2 percent general partner interest. We contributed assets valued at more than $1 billion to the partnership during 2015.

 Across our expanding Midstream business, we have a portfolio of organic, high- quality growth projects.
DCP Midstream and its master limited partnership, DCP Midstream Partners, completed projects during 2015 that increased their natural gas processing capacity to approximately 8.0 billion standard cubic feet per day. DCP Midstream continues to work on reducing costs and converting contracts to fee-based structures to improve its financial strength. In the fourth quarter, Phillips 66 and Spectra Energy, the joint venture owners, contributed cash and operating assets to strengthen the balance sheet of DCP Midstream and better position it to grow through future commodity cycles.
BUILDING A WORLD-CLASS MIDSTREAM ENERGY COMPLEX
Across our Midstream business, we have a portfolio of growth projects just completed or under construction.
On the U.S. Gulf Coast, Phillips 66 is building an energy complex that connects refining, NGL fractionation, storage and export capabilities. This hub is designed with pipeline connectivity to production areas and market centers to provide us with options on feedstock and product placement.
In December 2015, we began operating our new 100,000 barrels-per-day (BPD) NGL fractionator in Old Ocean, Texas. It supplies ethane and liquefied petroleum gases (LPG) to the petrochemical industry and heating markets, and is supported by 250 miles of new pipelines and new multimillion barrel storage caverns. A 25 percent interest in the NGL fractionator, associated caverns and ancillary facilities, valued at approximately $235 million, was contributed to Phillips 66 Partners during the first quarter of 2016.
In Texas, our 150,000 BPD Freeport LPG Export Terminal, scheduled for startup in the second half of 2016, will help us meet the growing global market demand for LPG. Additional projects, such as expanding our
Beaumont Terminal in Nederland, Texas, are underway for the U.S. Gulf Coast region to increase storage capacity and enhance connectivity to several major pipelines.
Phillips 66 owns a 25 percent interest in
two joint ventures that are constructing a long-haul pipeline system from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast, with startup expected
in the fourth quarter of 2016. In addition, Phillips 66 Partners is developing projects for crude oil gathering and rail-loading systems in North Dakota. The Palermo
Rail Terminal began operating in the fourth quarter, with the first unit train of crude
oil loaded in December.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, Phillips 66 Partners acquired Phillips 66’s 40 percent interest in the Bayou Bridge Pipeline project, which will deliver crude oil from terminals
in Nederland (including our Beaumont Terminal) to Lake Charles, Louisiana, and then on to St. James, Louisiana. The first leg of the pipeline should begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2016.
CAPTURING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN CHEMICALS
We continue to invest in our high-return Chemicals business, which consists of our 50 percent equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company (CPChem), the world’s largest producer of high-density polyethylene. Global demand for ethylene, propylene and polyethylene continues to grow, and CPChem’s primary assets are in the two most cost-advantaged regions of the world: North America and the Middle East.
Full-year Chemicals adjusted earnings were $952 million, compared with $1.2 billion
in 2014. CPChem’s Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) global capacity utilization rate for 2015 was 91 percent. The 2015 adjusted ROCE for the business was 19 percent.

 Phillips 66 markets fuels and lubricants under these brands.
CPChem is in the midst of a large capital development project on the U.S. Gulf Coast. It is constructing a 3.3 billion-pounds-per- year ethane cracker at its Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, Texas, and two
1.1 billion-pounds-per-year polyethylene facilities in Old Ocean, Texas. More than
70 percent complete as of Jan. 31, 2016, the approximately $6 billion project is expected to begin operating in mid-2017 and will increase CPChem’s global ethylene and polyethylene capacity by approximately 30 percent.
ENHANCING REFINING RETURNS
Phillips 66’s Refining segment is a significant competitor in the domestic fuels industry, with 11 of the company’s 14 refineries located in the United States. Globally, the business has a refining capacity of 2.2 million BPD.
In 2015, Refining’s adjusted ROCE
was 19 percent, reflecting our ability
to capture strong market conditions.
To enhance Refining returns, we are maintaining cost and capital discipline, expanding access to Gulf Coast export markets, optimizing feedstock costs and improving product yields.
Our Humber Refinery, located in the United Kingdom, completed a major turnaround during the year with zero process safety events and no shutdown or startup issues. Concurrent with this maintenance project, the Humber team replaced a 2.8 mile section of the Tetney Subsea Pipeline
on time and under budget.
SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS
Our Marketing and Specialties segment generated adjusted ROCE of 35 percent in 2015. The company markets refined petroleum products in the United States
under the Phillips 66, Conoco and 76 brands, and in Europe through JET and Coop branded outlets. In the United States, we have a network of marketers operating about 6,700 outlets, and in Europe, there are more than 1,500 company-owned and dealer-owned sites. Phillips 66 continues to expand its marketing footprint in Germany, the U.K. and Austria.
Our Specialties business, which manufactures and sells lubricants, petroleum coke products, solvents and polypropylene to commercial and industrial customers worldwide, continues to grow. The Lubricants business completed the integration of Spectrum Corporation, a specialty lubricants blender, packager
and marketer, which we acquired in 2014. Lubricants also achieved record base oil sales volumes in 2015 by optimizing base oil production at the Excel Paralubes Plant in Louisiana.
2015 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CAPITAL ALLOCATION
Full-year 2015 earnings were $4.2 billion, or $7.73 per share, compared with
$4.8 billion, or $8.33 per share, in 2014. Adjusted earnings for the year were $4.2 billion, or $7.67 per share, compared with $3.8 billion, or $6.62 per share, in 2014.
In 2015, Phillips 66 generated $5.7 billion in cash from operations, and Phillips 66 Partners issued $1.5 billion in debt and equity securities. These funds were used to invest $5.8 billion in capital spending, repay $800 million of debt, increase the dividend by 12 percent and return $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. We ended the year with cash of $3.1 billion and a debt-to-capital ratio of 27 percent.

                8 PHILLIPS 66 2015 ANNUAL REPORT
 Underpinned by a diversified cash flow
and a strong balance sheet, Phillips 66
is funding a $3.9 billion consolidated capital budget in 2016 as well as a growing dividend. Projects to be completed between now and 2018 will provide Phillips 66 with additional cash flow to fund growth and shareholder distributions.
Approximately two-thirds of the 2016
capital budget is for growth, mostly in the Midstream business, with about $400 million allocated to Refining projects that will improve product yields and lower feedstock costs. The remainder of the capital to be spent this year is sustaining capital, primarily for investment in Refining reliability, safety and environmental projects.
During 2016, Phillips 66 plans double-digit growth in its regular dividends and to continue share repurchases. Since 2012, the company has increased quarterly
dividends by 180 percent, reduced share count by over 15 percent, and returned $11.1 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and share exchange.
CREATING DIFFERENTIATED VALUE
We believe that our investments across the business portfolio will generate significant EBITDA growth over the next several years. Phillips 66 Partners continues to deliver
on its plan for a five-year, 30 percent distribution compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for unitholders through 2018. This growth will be driven by organic capital spending at the partnership, drop-down acquisitions of assets from Phillips 66 and selective third-party acquisitions.
Looking further into the future, we have
a substantial backlog of high-quality Midstream projects to invest in, many of which will leverage our existing asset base.
