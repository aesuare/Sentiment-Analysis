       THE BOEING COMPANY 2013 ANNUAL REPORT

 TO THE SHAREHOLDERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE BOEING COMPANY
With our sights set high in 2013, Boeing delivered an outstanding year of business performance, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our employees, our partners and our customers around the world.
We extended our industry leader- ship in commercial airplanes; maintained our strong position
in defense, space and security markets; achieved major mile- stones on key new development programs; and retired legacy and future risks to our performance and growth plans.
With core strengths in innovation, productivity and disciplined execution; a highly skilled and motivated team; a record backlog; and competitively superior tech- nology, products and services, Boeing is positioned for sustained success in 2014 and beyond.

2013 REVIEW
Higher deliveries at Boeing Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space
& Security increased our 2013 revenues by 6 percent to a record $86.6 billion. Continued strong demand for our market- leading products and services fueled $135 billion in new orders and raised our record backlog to $441 billion—a $51 bil- lion increase from year-end 2012.
Strong core operating performance throughout the year produced record core earnings per share of $7.07* (a
20 percent increase over 2012) on record core operating earnings of $7.9 billion*. Operating cash flow rose 9 percent
to $8.2 billion.
Our strong operating performance and increased cash flow—along with confidence in the future—underpinned our decisions in December to raise our dividend by 50 percent and to authorize an additional $10 billion in share repurchases.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes
extended our global market-share leader- ship with an industry record 648 deliveries as we reached historic highs in planned production rates on the 737, 777 and
787 programs. Net new orders totaling 1,355 airplanes (the second-highest total in company history) increased our record backlog to 5,080 airplanes valued at $374 billion. Operating margins were a healthy 10.9 percent.
During the year we solidified our long-term leadership of the high-value twin-aisle segment with heavily sub- scribed launches of the 787-10 and 777X airplane family.
The 787-10 quickly accumulated 132 firm orders from six top global customers. The 777X delivered the largest product launch in commercial jetliner history by dollar value—more than $95 billion at
list prices—with 259 orders and com- mitments. Offering unprecedented fuel efficiency and operating economics in their classes, these new airplanes will

further distance us from our competitor and deliver substantial value to our customers and company for decades to come.
Additional twin-aisle segment highlights included:
Delivering 65 Boeing 787 DreamlinersTM to 16 customers and booking orders for another 182 (bringing the total 787 orders to more than 1,000).
Beginning flight testing of the 787-9.
Delivering 24 747-8s, including the first with improved GEnx-2B engines.
We also strengthened our position in the single-aisle segment, capturing 1,046 orders across the 737 family. These orders will effectively bridge production between the current Next-Generation 737 and the new 737 MAX, which now has won nearly 1,800 orders.
To profitably build out our backlog and meet growing demand for our fuel- efficient new airplanes, we are producing 737s at a record rate of 38 per month, moving to a projected 42 per month in 2014 and 47 per month by 2017. We achieved our planned 10-per-month rate on the 787—the highest ever for a twin- aisle airplane—with plans calling for
12 787s per month in 2016 and 14 per month by the end of the decade. The 777 reached a record pace of 8.3 air- planes per month, while lower air cargo traffic led us to reduce 747-8 production to 1.5 per month.
Overall, commercial aviation remains a very attractive growth market worth more than $4.8 trillion over the next 20 years. Our product strategy advantage positions us for significant and sustained growth within this market.

to 9.7 percent. International business accounted for 26 percent of revenues and 37 percent of the division’s $67 billion backlog—further validating the merits of our ongoing global-strategy expansion.
Notable 2013 milestones included starting assembly of four 767-based KC-46A Tanker test aircraft, delivery of five C-17s and three P-8I aircraft to India, initial operational capability and delivery of eight P-8A Poseidon aircraft to the U.S. Navy, production of the 2,000th Apache helicopter, and the longest hypersonic flight to date of the X-51A WaveRider.
Despite intense budget pressure in our traditional markets of the United States and Europe and increased global compe- tition elsewhere, we fortified our position with key wins worth $28 billion, including:
Multiyear contracts for 99 V-22 Osprey tiltrotor aircraft for the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Air Force and up to 215 CH-47F Chinook helicopters
for the U.S. Army.
36 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters for the Republic of Korea.
Full-rate production of the U.S. Navy P-8A Poseidon and a contract for 13 additional aircraft.
U.S. Air Force contracts for GPS mod- ernization and A-10 wing replacement.
First payload customer for the liquid hydrogen–powered Phantom Eye unmanned airborne system.
We also made the difficult but necessary decision to end C-17 production and close our Long Beach, Calif., facility in 2015.
The C-17 remains a model of operational consistency and effectiveness, and we
are focused on delivering our remaining production to international customers.
In a global defense, space and security market worth $3.0 trillion over the next decade, our strengths remain our portfolio of proven, reliable and affordable systems and services; our relentless
pursuit of productivity and affordability in support of our customers; and the on- budget, on-schedule performance that our key programs are delivering.
COMPETING TO WIN
As competitive and fiscal pressures
on our customers intensify, they are demanding more from us and our sup- ply chain. They want more capability, efficiency, quality and reliability in our products and services—but for less money and at lower technical and schedule risk.
To maintain our competitive edge in this “more for less” world, last year we intro- duced and accelerated several initiatives to further improve affordability:
Our “Partnering for Success” program—which aims to reduce costs, and improve first-time quality and component reliability throughout our supply chain—was expanded beyond our top-tier suppliers. Tangible early results include several billion dollars in committed savings through 2017, and more afterward.
Enterprise efforts to reduce the spiraling cost of development programs meaningfully improved the 787-10 and 777X business cases, enabling their successful launches.
Awareness of workplace safety increased, and injuries declined, as we moved to strengthen this aspect of our culture to improve employee health and productivity.
During the year, we also moved forward with geographical diversification plans for our enterprise research and technology centers, new domestic and international engineering design centers for com- mercial airplanes, and information technology centers of excellence. This broader strategic footprint will ensure business continuity, improve productivity and expand access to global talent
and technology.
Innovation fuels our future with a steady introduction of exciting new products in the years ahead.

2020
The 400-seat
777X builds on the passenger-preferred, market-leading 777, and offers more market coverage and revenue capability than the competition. First delivery is scheduled for 2020.
In addition, we retired significant financial risk by settling with the U.S. government over the legacy A-12 litigation, which dated back to 1991. In early 2014, we also secured unprecedented long-term contract extensions with our machinists unions in the Pacific Northwest and St. Louis that greatly reduce program execu- tion risk, ensure business continuity for our customers and further improve our productivity and competitiveness.
Through these efforts—along with our everyday focus on disciplined execution and improved productivity to fund innovation—we are strengthening our ability to fulfill the rising expectations of our customers.
OUR PATH FORWARD
At Boeing Commercial Airplanes, launching the 787-10 and 777X effectively completes a comprehensive renewal of our product line. We sought and have achieved an advantage over the competi- tion in every segment by tailoring our innovation to customer needs and repli- cating systems and technologies already proved and paid for on other programs
to reduce costs and risk. The imperative now is to execute—to deliver on our lower-risk development agenda and to harvest our record backlog to fund those projects and provide increasing returns to all stakeholders.
Progress on our development programs continues at a disciplined pace. Flight testing of the 787-9 has gone well, and first delivery is on track for mid-2014. The 737 MAX reached firm configuration in July. Scheduled for service entry in 2017, it is projected to be even more fuel efficient than originally thought.
The 787-10 is on plan for first delivery in 2018 and will incorporate a high degree of shared design elements and parts commonality with the 787-9 to likewise minimize risk and lower development and fleet maintenance costs. The 777X is slated for firm configuration in 2015 and first delivery in 2020.
Lessons from the 787’s entry into service are being applied to improve that ex- perience on our new airplanes. Since returning to service last spring with a modified battery system, and with other recent updates, the 787’s fleetwide on-time departure rate has steadily improved. However, we won’t rest until our customers are completely satisfied.
Our 2014 Commercial Airplanes priorities are to profitably deliver our record back- log at our new, higher production rates; execute our 737 MAX, 787-9, 787-10 and 777X development efforts on plan; further enhance in-service reliability of the 787; and continue to leverage and grow our services business.
At Boeing Defense, Space & Security, we were encouraged by U.S. government action in early 2014 to provide near-term relief from sequestration-related budget cuts for the Department of Defense and other government customers. Although the ultimate impact of sequestration remains uncertain, our domestic market remains our largest opportunity, and we are as strongly positioned within it as any of our competitors.
Having anticipated these challenges, we remain focused on meeting our com- mitments and serving our customers’ evolving security needs. We continue
to proactively take the steps necessary
to compete effectively, and to make our products and services more desirable and affordable for domestic and growing international markets. We achieved $4 bil- lion in cost reductions over the past three years and are on plan to drive out another $2.1 billion in annual operating costs.
This productivity is funding research and development in growing areas, includ- ing military derivatives of commercial airplanes; space; unmanned systems; intelligence, surveillance and reconnais- sance; cybersecurity; and the few but critical future large-scale programs identi- fied as priorities by our customers. These investments are boosting our long-
