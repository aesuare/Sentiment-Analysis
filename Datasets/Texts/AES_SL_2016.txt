We are at a time of immense change and excitement
in our industry. The power grid of the 21st century will look very different from what we have seen in the past, offering cleaner and more affordable energy. Renewables are increasingly cost competitive and have become the dominant type of new build generation in most of our markets. Existing thermal generation and energy storage will become more integrated with newer renewable sources to meet challenges posed by the intermittent nature of wind and solar generation. We also see a growing demand for natural gas, with the potential for gas to replace oil-fired generation in several markets.
Our actions over the past several years have put AES in a great position to be a premier provider of energy solutions across our markets during this time of immense change. As we seek to meet the evolving needs of our energy customers, we benefit from a strong balance sheet, a unique and diverse global platform, proven success in deploying new technologies and a talented global workforce.
In 2016 we expanded our renewables portfolio and grew our world-leading battery-based energy storage business. We began selling our proprietary Advancion® storage platform to utilities and other customers. We have now deployed Advancion for projects we own and operate across seven countries, with 436 MW in operation, under construction or in advanced stage development. We also broke ground on a new gas-fired plant and LNG regasification facility in Panama, enabling us to play a leading role in delivering cleaner and lower-cost natural gas throughout Central America. We have deployed new technologies such as drones and robotics to improve safety and lower costs for our businesses, and we are continually seeking innovative applications of technologies to improve our performance.
We continued to make progress on our strategic objectives throughout 2016. Our asset sales program has now achieved $3.6 billion in total sale proceeds, allowing us to refocus our activities on select markets in which we have the greatest competitive advantage. In the process, we achieved our incremental $50 million cost savings and revenue enhancement target and we are on track to reach $350 million in annual savings by 2018. We brought on-line 2,976 MW of construction projects in 2016 to drive future growth. We also achieved our financial guidance, reduced our corporate debt and increased our dividend.
Despite 2016 being a successful year overall, we did experience some headwinds. Several of our construction projects were delayed, most notably the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile, which required a restructuring of its financing and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). We also had large impairments at DPL in Ohio and our Buffalo Gap wind projects in Texas, which reflect unsuccessful past investments.
The progress we did make in 2016 on our strategic objectives was reflected
in our stock performance. We had a very positive year and generated total
shareholder return of 26.3%, outperforming the S&P 500 (up 12.0%), the 2020 S&P Utilities Index (up 16.3%) and U.S. listed independent power producers
(down 17.2%).

2016 RESULTS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Turning to our specific results and accomplishments in 2016, we delivered on our financial guidance, continued to meet our commitments to our shareholders and extended our progress on our strategy. In terms of future growth in free cash flow and earnings, we expect 8%-10% growth in our financial metrics through 2020.
As a result of our actions in 2016, we generated Proportional Free Cash Flow of $1,417 million and Parent Free Cash Flow of $579 million. As expected, our Adjusted Earnings Per Share was below our 2015 results, primarily due
to headwinds from foreign currency and commodity prices, as well as a continued decline in demand in Brazil. We were able to offset much of the impact, and our 2016 Adjusted EPS came in at $0.98. During the year, we also achieved many of our strategic objectives. In addition to the cost savings and completion of construction projects previously mentioned, we also:
• Announced or closed $500 million in proceeds from the sales or sell- downs of eight businesses;
• Increased our quarterly dividend by 9.1%, to $0.12 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2017; and
• Advanced 3,389 MW of construction projects which are expected to come on-line through 2019.
SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY
Since late 2011, we have successfully delivered on our strategic goals and during 2016 we extended our progress. The actions we have taken since 2011, such as cutting our costs, de-levering and reducing our complexity through asset sales have put us in a strong position to execute on our strategic growth opportunities.
Reducing Complexity
We have been rebalancing our business mix by exiting certain businesses to reduce risk and re-deploying our excess cash into debt repayment, share repurchases, dividends and growth projects with long-term, U.S. Dollar- denominated contracts. Since 2011, we have raised $3.6 billion in equity proceeds from asset sales, decreasing the total number of countries where we have operations from 28 to 17.
Leveraging Our Platforms for Long-Term Growth
We are focusing our growth on platform expansions in markets where we already operate and have a competitive advantage to realize attractive risk-adjusted returns. Since 2011, we have brought on-line 7,932 MW of new projects, including 2,976 MW of platform expansion projects in 2016 alone.
We currently have 3,389 MW under construction, representing $6.4 billion in total capital expenditures, with the majority of AES’ $1.1 billion in equity already funded and expected to contribute a targeted return on our equity of approximately 14%. These projects under construction are the most significant driver of our near-term growth.
Allocating Capital in a Disciplined Manner
Our top priority is to maximize risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders, by taking a long-term perspective on investing our free cash flow.
Since 2011, we have generated substantial cash by executing on our strategy, which we allocated in line with our capital allocation framework:
• We used $2,263 million to prepay and refinance Parent debt;
• We returned $2,402 million to shareholders through share repurchases and a quarterly dividend; and

2017 2018–19

   • We invested $1,336 million in our subsidiaries, largely for projects that are currently under construction.
We remain committed to strengthening our credit, which is largely driven by the successful completion of our construction program, cost reductions and de-levering. Accordingly, we continue to be confident that we can achieve investment grade stats by 2020.
CREATING LONG-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE
AES strives to create long-term shareholder value by providing safe and reliable electricity-related services in the markets we serve. We have a unique portfolio of businesses with significant presence in both mature and rapidly growing developing markets. This makes AES well positioned to deliver attractive long-term growth in cash flow, dividends and earnings.
Underlying Strengths of Our Businesses
As a result of our proactive contracting and portfolio rebalancing initiatives, today, about 80% of our business is U.S. Dollar-based and about 83% is either contracted generation or regulated utilities. The average remaining life of the PPAs at our contracted businesses is six years, and when we complete our projects currently under construction, this will be extended to ten years. Long-term PPAs provide stability and predictability to our earnings and cash flow.
The majority of our businesses are low-cost, flexible and reliable electricity providers with strong locational advantages. Our knowledge of these markets and critical mass also puts us in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities or quickly respond to changing conditions.
Future Growth
Future growth across our markets will be heavily weighted towards less carbon-intensive natural gas, wind and solar generation. We will seek opportunities in these growth areas for projects with long-term, U.S. Dollar- denominated contracts. The targeted projects will improve the quality of our cash flow and help us achieve our credit objectives, while reducing the carbon intensity of our portfolio.
With respect to renewables, we see an attractive business opportunity in light of several trends, such as:
• The dramatic drop in the cost of renewables that have made their energy production competitive;
• Growingdemandforrenewables–renewableshavebecomethedominant type of new generation build across almost all of our markets; and
• The availability of long-term PPAs for renewables, providing predictable, stable cash flows.
The intermittent nature of renewables does pose challenges for the grid. We believe AES’ ability to leverage renewables by integrating them with conventional generation and energy storage can meet these challenges and give us a strong competitive advantage.
To that end, we recently agreed to acquire sPower, the largest independent solar developer in the United States. sPower brings 1.3 GW of installed capacity with an average remaining contract life of more than 20 years with very credit-worthy offtakers and a first class management and development team with a pipeline of more than 10 GW. We are very excited by the scale and capabilities from this acquisition as we look to expand our renewables portfolio across all our markets and integrate renewables with our extensive conventional generation fleet and world-leading energy storage platform.
