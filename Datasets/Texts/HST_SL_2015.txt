3 We repaid or refinanced more than $1.4 billion in debt, reducing our weighted average interest rate by 110 basis points and extending our average debt maturity to six years, all of which further bolstered our industry-leading balance sheet.
We delivered solid improvements in operating performance in 2015 as RevPAR at our comparable hotels increased 3.8% (on a constant US Dollar basis). Despite being impacted by significant renovation activity during the first half of the year and adverse economic headwinds in the fourth quarter, we recorded the highest comparable RevPAR in our his- tory, $170.34, driven by occupancy levels of 77.4% and average rates of over $220, far exceeding the industry average, and helping to deliver Adjusted EBITDA of over $1.4 billion and net income of $571 million. Adjusted FFO, which directly reflects our balance sheet initiatives, including our efforts to reduce our annual interest payments and return capital to stockholders, improved to $1.54 per share for the year, while diluted earnings per share was $0.74.
For 2016, we expect to continue to execute on our strategic initiatives to drive stockholder value. We expect to complete our exit from our Asia/Pacific markets, thereby simplifying our portfolio and streamlining our focus on North American and European gateway markets. We will continue to focus on creating and mining value from our existing portfolio through capital investments and value enhancement initiatives. We will continue to leverage our experience as the owner of one of the largest and most diverse lodging portfolios to seek to differentiate our assets within their competitive markets, driving improvements in operating performance and enhancing the value of the real estate. While we recognize the volatility of the lodging industry, particularly during the uncertain global macro-economic atmosphere, we intend to continue to deliver value to our stockholders through earnings growth, a meaningful dividend and the continued execution of our stock repurchase program. We are confident that our combination of superior assets, financial strength, and management expertise will continue to create an attractive opportunity for investors. We appreciate your support and will continue to work to provide superior returns to our stockholders.
Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging real estate investment company with a com- mitment to a long-term strategic focus. We have thoughtfully assembled and refined a geographically-diverse portfolio of high-quality assets. We have created stockholder value through disciplined allocation of capital and intelligent asset management oversight. We have built on the bedrock of a powerful and flexible capital structure to enable us to be opportunistic at any point throughout the lodging cycle. We are confident in the future of our business and from the boardroom to the back office we are focused on delivering real value to our stockholders.
Reflecting on our performance in 2015, we had a very active year and executed on a number of initiatives to capitalize on value enhancing opportunities to better position Host for continued growth and success.
3 We invested over $1 billion in 2015, including the acquisition of the iconic, AAA-Five Diamond luxury resort, the Phoenician Hotel. We also completed four comprehensive redevelopment and rebranding projects at The Camby in Phoenix, The Logan in Philadelphia, The Axiom in San Francisco and the Houston Airport Marriott at George Bush Intercontinental, while also completing the renovations of 8,000 guestrooms across the portfolio.
3 We sold over $1 billion in hotels, including properties owned in our European and Asia/Pacific joint ventures, further sharpening the portfolio’s focus on major markets.
3 We returned over $1.3 billion of capital to our stockholders through $650 million of dividends and $675 million of stock repurchases that were completed at a significant discount to the estimated net asset value of our assets.
