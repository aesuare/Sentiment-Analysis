          TO OUR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS
2015 WAS A REMARKABLE YEAR FOR OUR COMPANY, ONE OF
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL IN OUR 86-YEAR HISTORY. We have reshaped our business in significant ways, expanded our portfolio and increased the value we bring to our customers. We posted record revenue and adjusted earnings due to the strength of our recently acquired businesses and continued growth in our core businesses. We significantly expanded our presence across a variety of health care settings with the acquisition of Welch Allyn, bringing us
into the doctor’s office for the first time.
Throughout the year we continued to improve our operations, aggressively manage our costs and enhance our product offerings. I want to thank our 10,000 global employees for their dedicated efforts in support of our 2015 success.
 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
We are proud of the financial results we achieved in 2015. Our performance exceeded expectations as we posted record revenue and adjusted earnings, while also improving our operating margin.
We achieved $2.0 billion in revenue for the year, an increase of 18 percent – or 24 percent on a constant currency basis. This includes contributions from our recent Trumpf Medical and Welch Allyn acquisitions, as well as strong organic performance, as excluding acquisitions, we achieved 7 percent constant currency growth. Adjusted earnings per share was $2.64, up 17.3 percent over last year.

FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (CONTINUED)
These results were driven by strong growth in North America and Surgical and Respiratory Care, and were enhanced by our acquisitions of Trumpf Medical and Welch Allyn. Performance in our International business, which declined two percent,
at constant currency, offset this growth and was driven largely by challenges in the Middle East and Europe. Our Asia business had another solid year, with double-digit constant currency growth. As we have in recent years, we continued our efforts to aggressively manage the business, streamline our operations and reduce costs. We announced the
closure of manufacturing facilities in Redditch, England, and Charleston, South Carolina, as part of a multi-faceted effort to increase the efficiency of our global supply chain.
Throughout the year we continued to build momentum, and our fourth quarter set records for our company, a gratifying capstone to an exciting year. Fourth quarter revenue of $574 million represented a 25 percent increase on a constant currency basis compared to Q4 2014. This was attributable to strong performance in our North America capital business and the Trumpf Medical and Welch Allyn acquisitions.
Our track record of disciplined capital deployment reflects
a healthy balance between investing in the business and returning cash to shareholders. The Welch Allyn acquisition
is the largest in our history, and as we continue the integration of the two businesses our focus now is on accelerating the growth of the company, improving our profitability and responsibly managing our balance sheet. We will continue to explore strategic transactions that strengthen our existing platforms and continue to evolve our portfolio.
All told, the financial results we delivered this year demonstrate our ability to successfully execute our strategy and leave us well-positioned to continue to achieve our goals and create value for our shareholders in 2016.
  OUR PERFORMANCE EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS AS WE POSTED RECORD REVENUE AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS, WHILE ALSO IMPROVING OUR OPERATING MARGIN.

OUR EXPANDING PORTFOLIO
Welch Allyn brings to Hill-Rom an incredibly valuable global brand with a portfolio that adds significant
depth and breadth to our company, bringing us fully
into front-line patient care. I could not be more excited
by the acquisition of Welch Allyn and how it is already contributing significantly to the value that we bring to our customers and patients around the world. In addition to expanding our portfolio in ways that increase the clinical and economic value we bring to our customers, the acquisition provides a strong recurring revenue stream and an opportunity to expand our offerings across both the Hill-Rom and Welch Allyn channels.
Welch Allyn is the latest in a series of acquisitions that have significantly changed our business. In 2009, our business looked quite different than it does today – it was smaller and more reliant on the often-volatile hospital bed and equipment market. With the acquisitions of Aspen, Trumpf Medical and Welch Allyn, we have reshaped our company. We are larger, have a more diversified revenue stream and have significantly improved our financial profile.

    Acquisitions are not the only way we are expanding and improving our offerings to customers. We increased our research and development spending over 25 percent compared to last year, which allowed us to refresh major product lines and introduce new ones. Our R&D team has been consistently delivering new products over the last several years and our manufacturing team has met the challenge to ensure smooth launches.
CLINICAL FOCUS AREAS
     ADVANCING MOBILITY
WOUND CARE AND PREVENTION
CLINICAL WORKFLOW
Our development efforts remain centered on our five clinical focus areas, and include important new product offerings:
• The CompellaTM Bariatric Bed and the LikoGuard® Lift System. These products are aimed at providing a state-of- the-art solution to help hospitals treat their increasing number of bariatric patients with the care and dignity those patients deserve.
• The Trumpf MedicalTM iLED7® Surgical Light is a breakthrough lighting system that uses 3D sensor technology to continuously analyze the surgical area and adapt the lighting conditions automatically. Lighting changes that could interfere with a surgeon’s view, such as shadows cast by the surgical staff, are automatically detected and the lights adjust accordingly to ensure even, adequate light throughout the procedure.
Carefully designed, easy-to-use, clinically compelling and high-quality products like these are the foundation of our relationship with our customers as a premier med tech partner. But our promise to our customers runs deeper.
Hill-Rom has made strong relationships with our customers the centerpiece of our business since our earliest days.
Our Enterprise Accounts team brings that same focus on customer needs to its work with some of the largest health systems in the world. In the last several years, we’ve been granted a number of large, multi-year contracts due to
the team’s dedication to understanding the needs of our customers and identifying product offerings across the full spectrum of our portfolio that meet those needs. Our work extends well beyond the contract phase, however. We work closely and seamlessly with member hospitals to ensure a smooth transition and ongoing support. Our high-touch approach ensures we provide more than just clinical solutions to our customers; we become a true partner in care.
I hope you will visit ir.hill-rom.com to learn more about all we accomplished in 2015. Looking ahead to 2016, Hill-Rom now provides offerings across the continuum of care, from the clinic, throughout the hospital and continuing through the transition back into the home.
I speak for all of us at Hill-Rom when I say that we are proud of what we’ve accomplished and humbled, honored and energized by its impact on the patients and caregivers who rely on our products. We remain deeply committed to our mission: Every day, around the world, we enhance outcomes for patients and their caregivers.
Thank you for supporting our work in 2015 and in the years to come.
