  Chairman’s letter Fellow Shareholders,
In fiscal 2010, Constellation unveiled our new vision, “To elevate life with every glass raised.” While celebratory in spirit, the message reflects what we
see as a significant shift in consumer perspective regarding the concept of enjoyment.
When it’s time to relax, people are seeking comfort in what is familiar and true – those simple, everyday moments shared with good friends and family – elevated, of course, with a glass of their favorite wine, beer or spirit.
Rather than wait for the big occasion, core wine consumers are increasingly enjoying more premium brands “just because.” Robert Mondavi and
Clos du Bois are now a staple at pizza and movie nights at home while Kim Crawford, a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, is a regular at impromptu backyard barbeques. What used to be reserved for a fine dining experience is now being enjoyed in the moment. We call this the new special occasion and it’s creating

exciting opportunities to share our premium brands with more consumers.
As you’ll see throughout this Annual Report, fiscal 2010 was a year of inspired transformation for Constellation as we positioned the company for profitable, organic growth. Sadly, it also marked the passing of one of our greatest and most influential leaders, José Fernandez, Chief Executive Officer, Constellation Wines North America, who died on January 1, 2010. A passionate visionary and beloved colleague and friend, José masterfully balanced the
art and business of wine like no other. His legacy will continue to shape our business for many years to come.
As we look to the future, we see a landscape ripe with promise and potential. With a vision to elevate life with every glass raised, matched by a consumer desire to bring more quality to everyday occasions, I believe we are poised for a period of measurable growth which Constellation is uniquely qualified to deliver.
Sincerely,
Richard Sands
Chairman of the Board
