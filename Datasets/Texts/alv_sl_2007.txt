President's Letter

Dear Shareholders,
On April 1, I had the honor of becoming the new President and CEO of your company. I have worked for Autoliv in various positions for eight years and my predecessor, Lars Westerberg, is now the Chairman of the Board. Continuity is therefore assured.

I intend ­ together with our associates ­ to further develop Autoliv's leading positions. We will continue to grow our Company faster than the global automotive safety market, both organically and through acquisitions. We will also continue to reduce costs to increase our pro tability and cash ow. This cash can then be used to create shareholder value either through share buybacks, dividend increases or acquisitions. And, of course, in line with our social responsibility and business vision, we will continue to create value for our customers, employees and the societies where we operate. Autoliv's vision "to substantially reduce trafc accidents, fatalities and injuries" is concrete and measurable. It is highly motivating ­ in fact a privilege ­ to work for this company and for something as important and meaningful as saving lives. Unlike many companies' visions which are abstract and only achievable in the distant future, we turn our vision into reality every day. However, as we "Live our Vision", we must not lose focus of the realities of business. Since no company in the long run can provide valueadded products for its customers, well paying jobs for its associates, or attractive returns for its shareholders without pro tability and growth, I set the following priority list when I assumed of ce: 1. Short- and long-term Profitability 2. Long-term Growth 3. Shareholder Returns

Profitability
Pro tability quickly became our top priority reecting the fact that we saw operating margin sliding. The margin slid from 8.4% achieved in 2006 to "exceeding 8%" expected for 2007 at the beginning of the year, and then slid further to "close to 8%" expected after the rst quarter. The nal level landed at 7.9% on a comparable basis (i.e. excluding the effect of a court ruling, see page 37). Although this decline of 0.5 percentage points is due to unusually high start-up costs in China, higher raw material prices and distressed suppliers, we had to ensure that this would not become the start of a new trend. Therefore in 2007, we intensi ed our efforts to shift production and engineering to low-cost countries (LCC) and to increase our sourcing of components in these countries. As a result, we currently have 52% of our personnel in LCC (see graph) compared to 47% a year ago and less than 10% when the program started in 1999. As to purchasing components, we increased the share purchased in LCC to 30% (see graph) and we remain committed to our target to reach 50% by the end of this decade. Additionally, in 2007, our restructuring activities were unusually high, which resulted in $10 million higher restructuring costs than in 2006. One seatbelt plant in the U.S was closed down and several other manufacturing lines were moved to Mexico and other LCC.

In 2007, we also improved labor productivity by more than 7%, well above our target of at least 5% annually (see graph). Our 42,000 associates have done a great job to help Autoliv achieve these results. I am grateful to everyone who continously contributes to the success of our company through their dedicated daily work. Thanks to them and the actions I just mentioned, operating margin should recover in 2008.

Long-term Growth
However, it is not enough to maintain a steady margin. In order to grow earnings and cash ow we also need to grow our top line. In this respect, we are helped by the expected continued growth of both vehicle production and the safety content per vehicle. Global light vehicle production is expected to increase at an average annual rate of 4% through 2010 according to industry forecasting institutes and, according to our estimates, the average safety content per vehicle is expected to increase in the range of 0-1% per year depending on the production mix (see page 14) during same period. Our target is to grow faster than this expected growth rate for the market of at least 4% and, as a result, to take market share. Of course, as Autoliv already has more than one third of the global market, this target is challenging. However, we have several opportunities to continue to outperform the market.

Furthermore, we have initiated a strategic review to identify new ways to accelerate growth even further, for instance, by acquisitions and/ or by expanding into adjacent markets. Consequently, we are pursuing a dual-path strategy.

Strengthening Core Business
First of all, we aim at capitalizing on opportunities that will strengthen our core business. We will, for instance, take advantage of the fact that the fastest growing product in our market is side curtain airbags. Autoliv introduced this patented technology in 1998 and we still command a global market share of approximately 40%. Over the next several years, sales of this product will be driven by new regulations issued in 2007 that, in effect, mandate the phase-in through August 2013 of side curtain airbags in all new light vehicles sold in the U.S. In other regions, sales will be driven by the fact that curtain airbags are twice as ef cient in preventing head injuries in side crashes as frontal airbags are in eliminating severe injuries in frontal crashes. We are also taking advantage of increasing demand for active seatbelts (see page 19). These belts can be tightened ahead of an imminent crash by use of an electrical motor. In addition, these seatbelts are reversible and the webbing can therefore be released again to normal comfort, should the driver manage to avoid the crash. Currently, we have two customers with three luxury vehicle models for these state-ofthe-art seatbelts. From these manufacturers of premium vehicles, active seatbelts are likely to migrate to typical higher-volume vehicles thereby driving higher demand, lower cost and prices. The strong demand is also the result of the market penetration of electronic stability control (ESC). Our Safety-Vent Airbag (see page 18) also offers new growth opportunities. This airbag addresses the problem in a frontal crash when front-seat passengers are sitting too close or are coming too close to the airbag in a sudden precrash braking. Our uncomplicated but reliable safety-vent solution is also seen as an alterna-

tive in most U.S. vehicles to the expensive and complex weight sensors that turn the airbag off if there is a child or a child seat in the front-passenger seat. We already have more than 30 contracts for our cost-saving, smart airbag solution which was introduced as recently as 2006. We continue to heavily invest in our existing business, particularly in Asia Paci c and Eastern Europe which are forecasted to account for the vast majority of the growth in global light vehicle production in the foreseeable future. In China, for instance, we now have nine plants after launching four new plants within a year, and we are now in the process of adding a new tech center in the Shanghai area. In 2007, we also made one of our few remaining af liated companies wholly-owned to take full advantage of the rapid market growth in China. In India, we also made our joint venture wholly-owned and commenced construction of India's rst airbag plant. We also acquired the remaining shares in our Korean joint venture. The costs for these three acquisitions totalled $130 million during the year. Even if they are not major acquisitions, they are strategically important as a means of taking better advantage of the rapid growth in emerging markets.

Expand Core Business
We will also seek growth opportunities in new, adjacent market segments to our traditional airbag and seatbelt markets. We will therefore continue to invest in research, development and engineering (R,D&E) to further strengthen Autoliv's technological market leading position. We are committed to maintaining the current high R,D&E level of close to 8%, gross, which corresponds to approximately 6%, net, of sales.

A new market in active safety where we have already established a strong foothold is the market for night vision systems. Our highly ef cient, long-range far-infrared system is already optional in BMW's 7-, 6- and 5-series. In addition to BMW, we have two new prestigious customers for future deliveries. With such compelling conrmations for a substantial market demand in night vision systems, we and our suppliers have started to develop the next generation of our advanced infrared sensing technology. The night vision system is just one example of our active safety projects. Other such projects are stereo vision cameras and vehicle radars that accurately measure the distance to traf c hazards ahead of the vehicle. These systems should therefore be able to forewarn the driver or prepare the vehicle's safety systems when the crash is unavoidable. This kind of pre-crash sensing will be particularly useful for improving occupant protection in side impact collisions where the time to deploy our safety systems is extremely short and the occupant is sitting close to a thin door. These pre-crash sensors will, for instance, enable the car manufacturers to pressurize the door beams in a crash using airbag in ator technology. Such "active" structures could also be used in frontal crashes, of course. It is even conceivable that the crashworthiness of the vehicle could be improved so much that it will be possible to redesign the entire chassis and take out weight. This technology has attracted the vehicle manufacturers' attention as they are aggressively trying to reduce vehicle weight in order to reduce CO2 emissions. The project is very exciting, but also a number of years from completion since it involves redesigning ­ and then testing ­ a completely new structure of the vehicle.

An entirely new area where we see signi cant long-term potential is alcohol sensors and so called "interlock systems". Virtually all types of traf c fatalities have been reduced thanks to improved vehicle and road safety. However, alcohol-related fatalities have remained a very serious traf c problem. Vehicle crash statistics indicate that approximately one third of the automotive fatalities in the Triad (i.e. North America, EU and Japan) are alcohol related. Consequently, both traf c authorities and car companies are looking for affordable interlock systems that could lead to standard equipment installations in all vehicles. In addition to being affordable, the product needs to be accurate, fast, reliable and easy to use ­ but not easy to trick! This is what we ­ and some authorities supporting our project ­ believe we have found in an alcohol sensor currently in development in one of our labs. Acquisitions should also be an option to expand our core business, provided it is the right asset and the right price. We remain interested in the acquisition of companies and technologies that offer synergies and are accretive. Otherwise, it is better that the funds are returned to shareholders.

Shareholder Value
In the nal analysis, our performance will be measured by the value we manage to create for Autoliv shareholders. The road to this goal starts with achieving customer satisfaction, motivating our employees and creating trust and con dence in our commitment to society for sustainable development. Our model for creating shareholder (see page 24-25) value is simple and straight forward: we

focus on long-term cash ow that should provide competitive returns to shareholders while ensuring growth and long-term nancial stability. Cash ow from operations should be reinvested in operations as long as the return on investment exceeds the cost for capital. Such investments could, of course, include strategic acquisitions. However, when the tipping point between return and cost of capital is reached, it is better that funds are returned to shareholders. Whether this should be done through more share buybacks or increasing the dividend depends on which method is most bene cial for our shareholders. Hence, our approach is to be opportunistic with our share repurchase program as we try to buy more shares when the stock price is deemed to be low and fewer shares when the price is deemed to be high. We could also leverage Autoliv's strong balance sheet to further nance share buybacks, as we have in the past. In this way, we can improve our key ratios faster than our underlying operational performance, thereby providing for a better performance of our shares. For instance, since 2003, Autoliv has managed to grow earnings per share at a compounded average growth rate (CAGR) of 8.8% compared to a CAGR of "only" 5.7% for operating income during the same period. More than 70% of this superior EPS growth is due to share buybacks. In 2007, we bought back 6.6 million shares, thereby returning a record-high amount of $380 million to shareholders ­ in addition to $121 million in dividends. This should have a positive long-term effect on our stock by enhancing our key ratios.

Outlook for 2008
During this year, we expect to continue to ramp up production in our new Chinese manufacturing facilities. This should have a gradual, favorable impact on our margins as the capacity utilization rises. We should also bene t from higher vehicle production in Asia Paci c and Eastern Europe and from higher installation rates of side curtain airbags both in North America and Europe. However, light vehicle production is expected to decline by 5% both in North America and Western Europe. Since Autoliv generates more than 70% of its consolidated sales in North America and Western Europe, the impact on us will be signi cant and the weighted average increase in global light vehicles will be less in our larger markets than the expected global average of 2.5%. However, we expect to offset this negative effect by strong side curtain sales, market share gains in safety electronics and steering wheels, and by continued step-up in sales of active seatbelts and seatbelt pretensioners. We will also be helped during the latter part of the year by a number of important launches of new vehicle models. In addition, currency effects could have a favorable impact of 4% provided that the mid-February exchange rates prevail. In conclusion, we expect sales in 2008 to grow by 7% with the organic sales portion growing at approximately 2% and the acquisition in India contributing 1%. Operating margin is expected to improve despite the drop in light vehicle production in our largest markets and to reach a level between 8.0-8.5% in line with our long term target of 8-9%.

"In the final analysis, our performance will be measured by the value we manage to create for Autoliv shareholders."
