To Our Stockholders:

LifePoint Hospitals was formed over a decade ago with a distinctive focus on hospitals in non-urban markets. Where others saw challenges, we saw opportunities. We adopted a unique role by partnering with our neighbors to strengthen the vitality of our communities, and we now proudly serve 47 communities from Wyoming to Virginia. As the sole hospital provider in nearly all of the markets we serve, our services and support enable local hospitals to survive and grow, while enhancing the long-term viability of the community itself. We are proud to celebrate our 10th anniversary of Making Communities Healthier and bringing value to our stockholders. Reflecting on our first decade, we can say that LifePoint not only has become a leader in non-urban markets, but also fulfilled its mission to be an integral part of the communities in which we operate. We have not only endured, but prospered; and we have helped strengthen communities by investing in our people, our hospitals and the hometowns where we have established a strong foundation of success for the next decade of LifePoint's growth. Quality is our Anchor Much of our 2009 success can be attributed to the efforts we began several years ago. The four pillars of our strategic operating plan provide the context for our efforts to achieve continuous operational improvements. These strategic pillars strengthen our company and support and facilitate our long-term growth. The foundation of our success is (and always will be) quality. Delivering quality care ­ through investments in new technologies and service lines and through a quest for excellence in every area ­ drives both patient and physician satisfaction, which in turn drive growth. More than that, quality is part of our commitment to the people we serve. Patients and their families served by our hospitals are more than that to us; they are the neighbors we know by name. Accordingly, we place the highest priority on delivering high-quality care. While we have long been known for upholding high standards, we are more dedicated than ever before to improving the quality of care in our hospitals. Our commitment is reflected in steady increases over the past two years in our quality scores. In 2009, we achieved aggregate scores above 95% in each of the four core quality measures by which all hospitals are evaluated. In the process, we believe we added value for all of our stakeholders: patients, physicians, communities and stockholders. A Birthday Year, and One to Grow on By virtually every measure, our 10th anniversary year was one in which our company achieved significant progress, meeting or achieving the financial and operational goals we communicated at the beginning of the year.

Amid the economic challenges that affected our entire industry, we continued to make strong financial progress. Revenues from continuing operations increased to $3.0 billion in 2009 ­ up 9.7% over the previous year. Income from continuing operations attributable to LifePoint Hospitals, Inc. rose to $139.2 million, or $2.59 per diluted share, an increase of 9.8% from 2008. We believe that our track record and the experience of our team position us well for the future. We practiced fiscal discipline amid a business climate that was marked by high leverage rates, and that discipline allowed us to enter our second decade with a strong balance sheet, solid liquidity and relatively low debt. As a result, we have the resources to continue making investments that will support our strategy and enhance our competitive position. Even with the uncertainty that affects our national economy, we have reason to be optimistic about the future. Building on Our Strength One of our strategic pillars, physician recruitment, retention and satisfaction, is both a priority and a differentiating strength for our company. In sole-provider community hospitals, where these facilities support the broad range of services that keeps patients close to home, new physicians, using the tools we provide, are a key factor. Our ability to meet the challenge of attracting needed physicians to small towns and rural communities has long been one of our company's strong suits. Under our strategic plan, we aimed high, with a goal of adding approximately 100 new physicians in each of the past two years, net of departures. We met that goal in 2008. Last year, we surpassed it by nearly 50%. At the same time, we exceeded our goals for physician retention. With more open lines of communication, a stronger physician voice, greater transparency and our focus on quality, we are working toward the highest levels of physician satisfaction we have ever achieved. Our successes in recruitment and retention tell us that these efforts to strengthen physician relationships are making a difference. Maintaining healthy and active medical staffs should facilitate our efforts to grow and to provide more healthcare services in our hospitals, close to home. Having the right physicians on our medical staffs ­ and an appropriate mix of primary care and specialized physicians ­ should allow us to execute on our strategy of offering profitable new service lines at many hospitals and to make the investments in technology to support those lines. We firmly believe that we can gain market share in every one of our markets, and we intend to do so.

Today, more than ever, hospitals face challenges on a variety of fronts. If our record demonstrates anything, it is that LifePoint Hospitals is a company with the experience and skill to succeed in such an environment. We have proven that we have built and executed a strategic plan that has driven ­ and will continue to drive ­ our success.

New Communities, New Opportunities Another pillar of our strategy is selective growth in new markets. Last year, we acquired Rockdale Medical Center in Conyers, Georgia. Rockdale is larger than the average LifePoint facility, and it is situated in a community that has enjoyed high population growth rates. As we think about acquisitions in 2010 and beyond, we are focusing on hospitals that offer characteristics similar to Rockdale, and we are encouraged by the opportunities we see. Growing Stronger from Within Finally, we continue to strive to be a company where the best people want to make a career ­ an organization that recognizes, attracts and nurtures talent. From our senior management to hospital administrative teams to our staff members, we believe that our people are our most valuable asset, and we work to equip them with the tools they need to do the best job possible. We made an important addition to our senior team last year when Jeff Sherman became our new Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He succeeded David Dill, who now serves as our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. David, who has always worked closely with our operations teams, will continue to build on LifePoint's operations strength. Jeff, meanwhile, has made healthcare finance his career. His knowledge of healthcare and his deep financial experience at both the corporate and hospital levels make him an important asset in our efforts to further improve our financial performance. I am confident that we have the right team in place.

Toward a Second Decade of Success For 10 years, we have been making a difference in the lives of patients and communities. Today, more than ever, hospitals face challenges on a variety of fronts. If our record demonstrates anything, it is that LifePoint Hospitals is a company with the experience and skill to succeed in such an environment. We have proven that we have built and executed a strategic plan that has driven ­ and will continue to drive ­ our success. We have demonstrated that we can do it all while maintaining a strong balance sheet that allows us to make continuing investments in our communities and positions us to enter new communities through selective acquisitions. We are pleased with our progress over the past 10 years. Thanks to the dedication of LifePoint employees and physician partners, we have made communities throughout the United States healthier. Our success gives us reason to be excited and confident about the next 10 years. As always, we remain profoundly grateful for your support and your investment. Sincerely,

t

William F. Carpenter III President and Chief Executive Officer
