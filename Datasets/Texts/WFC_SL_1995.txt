Among the many highlights of 1995, four stand out as especially meaningful:
New customer acquisition increased. Noninterest income grew. Our returns on
assets and equity for 1995 placed
Wells Fargo as number one in profitability among themnation's 50 largest banks.
And most signigicant, we were successful in our effort to reach a merger agreement with first interstate Bacorp.
In Janurary 1996, we signed a definitive agreement and we expect to close early in the second quarter, subject to 
regulatory and shareholder approvals. The merger will be accounted for as a purchase. In the future, shareholders
should focus on our cash earnings as a measure of financial performance (see the next page for discussion on this topic)
We're not writing our typical shareholder letter this year: Our financial performance, business progress
and economic rationale for the merger have already been widely reported in the press. Instead, please turn
to the financial review section, which contains the information you should understand about our company
before the merger.
Our planning effort is well underway to assure a smooth transition as we consolidate the two
companies. We expect that next year at this time, we'll write a letter to you that will chronicle
one of Wells Fargo's most important years in its 144~year long history.
