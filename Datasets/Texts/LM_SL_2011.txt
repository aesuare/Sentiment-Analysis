 Mark R. Fetting
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Legg Mason, Inc.
Dear Fellow Stockholders: I am pleased to report that we made marked progress in repositioning Legg Mason for future growth this past fiscal year.
Legg Mason delivered strong results year over year, with increases in revenues, net income, and operating margin. Additionally, we experienced notable improvements in investment performance, significantly reduced our rate of long-term outflows and repurchased 9% of shares outstanding since our prior fiscal year ended March 31, 2010. When I wrote to you last year, we had recently announced our streamlined business model to significantly reduce our cost structure and drive margin improvement and profitability. Our streamlining efforts are well underway and we enter fiscal 2012 with confidence that, as projected, we will deliver between $130 and $150 million in run rate cost savings to our shareholders by March 31, 2012.
The u.S. and most major global stock markets continued their rebound over the last year, with the
u.S. stock market rising to its highest level since
the middle of 2008 on improved earnings in the corporate sector and rising investor confidence. We see clear signs of stability and growth returning to the global economy while continued fallout from European sovereign debt exposures, geopolitical risks, particularly in the Middle East, and concerns about financial regulation continue to weigh on the markets. As the Federal Reserve ends its bond repurchase program in the u.S. this month, it will be important for the private sector to begin investing and hiring in earnest to support the jobs and housing recoveries that have weighed on our economy. While we believe that the global economic recovery should pick up during the remainder of 2011, more recent trends are indicating that any recovery will remain gradual.

Fiscal Year Results and Highlights
As of March 31, 2011, Legg Mason’s assets under management were $677.6 billion, a decrease of
1% from $684.5 billion as of March 31, 2010. For
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011, we recorded operating revenues of $2.8 billion, up 6% from
$2.6 billion in fiscal 2010. Net income increased 24% to $253.9 million, or $1.63 per diluted share
for the same period, compared to $204.4 million,
or $1.32 per diluted share for the prior year. Our adjusted income2 was $439.2 million, or $2.83 per diluted share for fiscal year 2011, compared to $381.3 million, or $2.45 per diluted share for the prior year. The total return on Legg Mason’s shares was 26.6% versus 17.0% for the SNL Asset Manager Index for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011.
Our operating margin, as adjusted2, increased to 23.2% for the twelve months ending March 31, 2011, versus 20.7% for the same period a year ago. Importantly, our advisory fee yield ended the fiscal year at 36 basis points, up from 33 basis points a year ago, reflective of a higher percentage of assets in equities and alternatives and our success in attracting higher fee-yielding mandates, particularly in specialized fixed income mandates.

Our Strategic Priorities and Progress
These results reflect clear progress and improvements in our business and refined multi- manager strategy. As we continue to deliver value and solidify our position as a leading global asset manager, we are guided by three strategic drivers of growth that we believe will most effectively position our franchise:
• First and foremost, delivering sustained investment excellence over the long term. Each of our independent investment managers strives to deliver investment excellence, while meeting their clients’ objectives through continuous innovation and risk management, and creating superb franchise businesses of their own.
• Second, a corporate center that adds strategic value including excellence in global retail distribution focused on leveraging the unique capabilities of our investment affiliates and market opportunities where we have distribution relationships, across key channels, markets and products.
• And third, achieving a growth-oriented portfolio of affiliates. We seek to invest in strategic growth areas to enhance our products and distribution through lift-outs and bolt-ons or acquisition

 In February 2011, Western Asset celebrated the one year anniversary of the launch of the Western Asset Mortgage Defined Opportunity Fund (NYSE: DMO). During calendar year 2010, Legg Mason was the number one issuer of closed-end funds with $1.9 billion in assets raised, according to the Closed-End Fund Association and SEC filings.
opportunities. As we focus on ways to drive growth, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders, as appropriate.
In December 2010, we completed the realignment of our senior management team which includes Ron Dewhurst, Head of Global Investment Managers, Tom Lemke, General Counsel, Pete Nachtwey, Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Nattans, Head of M&A and Business Development, and Joe Sullivan, Head of Global Distribution. I believe that this proven and experienced team best positions us as we take advantage of opportunities in 2011 and beyond. Importantly, we are committed to the continuous improvement of our corporate center and a key element of our strategic priorities is to remain disciplined in monitoring our corporate efficiency and effectiveness.
Our Affiliates and Distribution Platform at Work
We remain highly encouraged by the improving trends in long-term flows, reflecting continued improved investment performance. The percentage of our long-term u.S. mutual fund assets outperforming their Lipper category average was 56% for the 1-year, 74% for the 3-year, 70% for the 5-year and 67% for the 10-year periods ending March 31, 2011. Investment performance, particularly at Western Asset, our largest affiliate, improved meaningfully during the fiscal year. Over 75% of Western Asset’s marketed composite assets and over 70% of our firmwide marketed composite assets, including liquidity, outperformed their respective benchmarks for the 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods through March 2011. Additionally, Permal, Royce & Associates, and Brandywine Global experienced continued strong long-term performance.
Legg Mason raised a total of $4.1 billion in new product launches during the fiscal year which helped drive a 43% reduction in long-term net outflows. We experienced positive flows in alternative assets during each quarter this fiscal year. Our equity outflows declined by 47% from the prior fiscal year and our fixed income outflows declined by 42% for the same period, but we know that we must do better. Our affiliates must now work to maintain their improved investment results and improve in areas in which they are underperforming.
Our Americas and International retail distribution platform is now centralized under the global leadership of Joe Sullivan. Gross sales generated by our Americas distribution group increased
by 7% to $36 billion during fiscal year 2011. In
our International business, we continue to build momentum across our key markets and product areas, with gross sales up 74% and net flows up 140% from the prior fiscal year. Our International distribution group has posted nine consecutive quarters of long-term net inflows through March 2011. With meaningful sales improvements in both Americas and International, we are focusing on better positioning our teams to capture the
unique capabilities of our affiliates, our extensive intermediary relationships, and an integrated approach to product development. We remain hard at work and, importantly, believe that the infrastructure we have in place is capable of supporting substantially greater distribution volume.
Legg Mason Japan hosted a seminar in Tokyo for fund distributors and local asset management companies in September 2010 and in collaboration with the Brazilian National Treasury. Additionally, Legg Mason Japan received an award for “Best Sales, Client Service and Marketing Support for fiscal year 2010—Special Award” from Ma-Do, an industry publication focused on the marketing and retail distribution of mutual funds in Japan.

Balance Sheet Strength and Flexibility
From a balance sheet perspective, we continue
to execute our capital management strategy outlined at the beginning of last year. During fiscal year 2011, we repurchased 9% or 14.6 million of shares outstanding at March 31, 2010, while maintaining a strong balance sheet with stable and continued cash generation. We ended the fiscal year with $1.4 billion in cash and approximately $1 billion in available cash. We recently announced a 33% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.08, which is now double the level of a year ago and we expect to repurchase up to $400 million in shares during this fiscal year, subject to market conditions. We will continue to take a conservative approach to capital management, with a strategic desire to maintain flexibility to invest in top line growth opportunities.
Positioning Ourselves for Growth
Having solidified our strategic growth objectives and demonstrated good progress during fiscal 2011, we are focused in fiscal 2012 on positioning ourselves for future growth across asset classes, geographies, channels, and products.

Earlier this year, our global distribution team hosted an exclusive webcast for over 675 clients with the theme “Striking the Right Balance.” The webcast featured the chief investment officers from four of our key affiliates who shared their market perspectives and insights: ClearBridge Advisors, Legg Mason Capital Management, Royce & Associates and Western Asset.
We intend to co-invest in our affiliates in organic growth; our seed capital balance as of March 31, 2011 stands at nearly $430 million with $100 million of seed capital invested for future growth during this fiscal year. We currently have in development additional closed-end fund launches across multiple affiliates including an energy master limited partnership fund that, subject to regulatory approvals, we believe will likely launch in the June 2011 quarter. Longer-term initiatives include further developing a pipeline of product ideas in the fixed income, equity and alternative asset classes. Our dedicated distribution team is also gaining momentum towards diversifying our distribution partners and channels, adding to our growth expectations.
An important element of our business model is the addition of investment capabilities through lift-out and bolt-on or acquisition opportunities. To date, we have made additions to our investment teams at several affiliates and anticipate these types of additive transactions to continue. We are committed to achieving a growth-oriented portfolio of quality affiliates, with an emphasis on bottom line earnings, and with products and in markets where we see the strongest long-term growth opportunities.
Our priorities in fiscal year 2012 are clear: supporting our affiliates in delivering on our fundamental goal of sustained investment excellence; completing our streamlining on time and realizing the projected
cost savings; and exploiting growth opportunities for our managers through our global distribution platform, while deploying capital smartly for our shareholders.
Appreciation and Closing
In 2010, we were saddened by the loss of two inspirational leaders who made significant
contributions to our firm: Ernest Kiehne and Kenneth Battye. Ernie joined Legg & Co, a predecessor to Legg Mason, as director of research in 1967 and went on to become a founding manager of Legg Mason’s first equity mutual fund. He worked for Legg Mason until his passing and will be most remembered for his eternal optimism. Ken joined Legg & Co. in 1947, beginning a career with our
firm that spanned 55 years, during which his compassion and commitment were unwavering.
The contributions of both gentlemen left an indelible mark on Legg Mason and continue to guide us in
the pursuit of our vision and values.
As Legg Mason continues to evolve and build upon its leading position in global asset management, our focus on the long term remains the same. We enter our new fiscal year energized and encouraged by the progress we have made and our opportunity to capture market share. Our firm has undergone many changes over the last three years that have affected our staff personally, but the constant that remains is their dedication and commitment to getting the job done. The road ahead will undoubtedly bring a new set of challenges as the global economy continues on its path towards recovery, but we believe in our ability to create value over the long term. And all
of us at Legg Mason remain determined to further improve our results to clients and shareholders and grow our global franchise.
