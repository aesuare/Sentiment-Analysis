expectations we have set for ourselves. We are in the business of ensuring that our members have access to quality healthcare that is cost-effective. While we succeeded in delivering quality healthcare, we struggled with making that healthcare cost-effective.

We have discovered the problems. Identifying the medical care cost problems was essential. We began 2005 with very strong first quarter results. In the second quarter, however, we experienced a rapid and unexpected increase in our medical care costs. These medical cost issues adversely affected the Company's performance throughout 2005. In response, we immediately undertook a

We believe we have identified those factors which caused us to have unexpectedly high medical costs, and we are diligently working to address them. Our goal is to return to our previous trajectory of healthy growth and strong performance. We are excited for 2006 and for the long-term future of the Company. We regard this past year as a shortterm setback, and we expect to emerge from our recent challenges stronger and even better prepared to take full advantage of the opportunities our growing field offers.

We then implemented an action plan to bring the cost spike under control and to ensure that our medical care costs going forward remain within predictable, manageable parameters. progress, as We our have made to return

I am confident that we are moving in the right direction. The effectiveness of our model is well-established. Along with others in our field, we have demonstrated that the business of managing healthcare services for Medicaid recipients can create improved health outcomes for plan members, improved cost-efficiency for payors, and real value for stockholders. As we look ahead, our commitment to quality and to the diverse communities we serve has never been stronger. The work that Molina Healthcare is doing, and that your investment makes possible, is important. We believe we are now positioned to carry out that work more effectively than ever before.

medical care costs: First, we experienced a shift in utilization to higher cost hospitals. This shift, we believe, reflects changes in the demographic makeup of our members and in their patterns of healthcare utilization. We observed a growth in membership in geographic areas where our hospital contracts were less favorable than was the case in other areas we serve. As a result, even if these patients were to access care no more frequently than our other members, costs in these areas would still increase.

Second, we found unexpected increases in both the number and in the severity of catastrophic cases, which we define as those cases requiring payments in excess of $50,000. Our analysis showed that the negative financial impact of these cases was greater last year than the positive impact of our strong growth in membership. Even a small number of catastrophic cases can have a disproportionate impact on our results. For instance, the cost of a single month-long episode of care for a patient with hemophilia can be over ten times as great as the cost of care for that same patient over the entire previous year. Third, we experienced higher costs and utilization of maternity services among the Medicaid populations in two of the states we serve. In Michigan, growth in our membership resulted in birth rates increasing by almost 40%. A major reason for this increase, we believe, is that the state last year made a concerted effort to encourage pregnant women to join Medicaid health plans. Meanwhile, early in the second quarter the state of Michigan effectively increased the rate that our Michigan plan pays to providers for maternity-related medical services. This increase caused our delivery costs to rise by 7%. The combination of higher utilization by members and higher costs to providers converged and affected the overall performance of the Michigan plan. Fourth, we witnessed increased utilization of outpatient services that were linked directly to a flu season that was particularly severe in both

Washington and Michigan, and also came later than expected. Because physician office visits for respiratory illnesses such as influenza do not require prior authorization by the health plan, it was difficult to detect this trend early and account for it in our financial modeling. We have undertaken measured but meaningful responses to rising medical care costs. Of course, identifying problems is only the first step. Correcting the problems is the most important step. Accordingly, we have redoubled our efforts to partner with cost-effective providers. In some geographic areas, this has meant reassessing our hospital network and entering into new contracts, either with existing providers or with new ones. It also has

required working more closely with our physician partners to ensure that they refer patients to cost-effective settings. While these efforts already are bearing fruit, we will remain very deliberate about continuing and increasing them. We have also begun working closely with state authorities to make certain that our premium rates are adequate to ensure that the Company does not bear a disproportionate share of financial risk. In Michigan, for example, while new rules required our Michigan plan to pay higher costs for maternity services, there was no corresponding increase in reimbursement rates. We are working to redress such imbalances.

In continuing to improve our payment processes, we have undertaken a number of initiatives to strengthen the links between medical management and claims payment. For example, we have enhanced our pre-authorization processes and our claims auditing procedures. We are making increased use of claims auditing systems that monitor providers' claims for accuracy. We have also engaged third-party vendors to review claims adjudication, both before and after the release of payments. In addition, the initial results from a pilot program we recently implemented on the validation of diagnosisrelated groups (DRGs) appear to be very promising. DRGs, used in classifying the healthcare services patients receive, are integral to the formula for reimbursing providers under Medicare and Medicaid. Under our pilot program, we

performance variations among healthcare providers, and we are increasing electronic data interchange and communication with physicians and hospitals. Meanwhile, we are relying on stronger case and disease management for patients with those chronic health conditions which typically account for a disproportionate share of total healthcare costs. Maintaining our focus on ensuring that our plan members seek and receive good primary and preventive care also helps reduce catastrophic cases. For example, even while we saw a much higher use of obstetrical services among our plan members in Michigan last year, we actually experienced a decrease in the utilization of neonatal intensive care unit services. Early quality prenatal care leads to healthier babies. Finally, drawing on our 25 years of experience as an operator of primary care facilities in California, we are evaluating the possibility of operating our own facilities in other states. In some cases, we believe this option may offer the best solution to ensuring quality and controlling costs in areas where cost-effective providers are not available or where patients are finding it difficult to see a primary care physician. While managing medical costs is central to our business, we remain equally focused on growth. In October 2005, our health plans in California, Michigan, Utah, and Washington were selected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, to operate Medicare Advantage Special Needs Plans, or SNPs. These SNPs serve dual-eligible members as well as

screened approximately 300 hospital DRG claims from one state, using new criteria that led to a review of the medical records in 90 of these claims. We found that 22 claims had been coded inaccurately by the providers. Ultimately, our claims costs were reduced by 43% in these cases. We are also working to implement more sophisticated medical informatics throughout our health plans, which will in turn facilitate more informed decision-making. With new informatics, we have enhanced our ability to interpret and apply medical data to improve our operations and control costs. Using authorization data as well as claims data will allow us to become better at predicting and managing our costs. We also are developing programs that support the identification of

those who are institutionalized or suffer from severe or disabling chronic conditions. Initially, our plans will serve only the dual-eligible population in these four states. We believe that our effort to attract these populations ­ particularly more elderly, blind, and disabled members ­ represents a natural extension of our long-standing commitment to providing access to quality healthcare for people who have traditionally been underserved by the healthcare system. In June 2005, we acquired two health plans in San Diego County, California. As a result, we expanded our Company's presence to a new market and added approximately 59,000 Medi-Cal members and 24,000 Healthy Families members. In Texas, we were awarded a contract to provide managed care services to Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program enrollees in a six-county area that includes Houston and Galveston. We look forward to beginning operations there in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our entry into this market, we believe, will provide a platform for expansion within one of the nation's most populous and fastest growing states ­ one with the culturally and linguistically diverse populations that Molina is well accustomed to serving. In April 2005, our HMO began operations in Indiana with approximately 5,000 members. By year's end, membership in our health plan statewide had increased to more than 24,000 members. We are very pleased by these results and look forward to continued growth in 2006.

Overall, we gained approximately 105,000 new members in 2005, and we now serve more than 893,000 members. The fundamentals of our industry are strong. We remain convinced that we are in the right field at the right time. Last year in this country nearly one out of every six dollars spent was spent on healthcare. That figure is projected to grow each year for the foreseeable future. In addition, managed care for ues to grow, driving demand for the kinds of services we offer. In fact, expenditures for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, or SCHIP, are projected to grow to nearly $600 billion by 2012. By far the fastest growing segment within Medicaid has been managed care. recipients of government-sponsored healthcare contin-

The federal and state governments are expanding managed care to new populations. For example, government payors are increasingly migrating elderly and disabled patients from traditional fee-for-service programs to managed care. On January 1, 2006, we began serving "dual eligible" patients ­ those Medicare beneficiaries who also qualify for assistance under Medicaid. Some states, including three in which we now operate, are also planning to extend managed care to recipients of Temporary Aid to Needy Families, or TANF, who live in counties where there is currently no mandatory enrollment for managed care.

Ours is also an industry that is witnessing considerable consolidation. As one of the most experienced operators in the Medicaid managed care sector, and as the market leader in Michigan, Utah, and Washington, we believe that Molina is well-positioned to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities. In the past several years, our Company has demonstrated an ability to successfully integrate new business and members into our existing operations. While we identify attractive opportunities for growth, we will remain disciplined in our efforts to expand. Our Company embraces the philosophy that quality healthcare and cost-effectiveness need not be mutually exclusive aims. All of our state health plans (with the exception of Indiana which is too new to be eligible) have now received accreditation from the National Committee for Quality Assurance, or NCQA. We are especially proud that our focus on quality has attracted national attention and recognition. In October of 2005, U.S. News & World Report, in collaboration with the National Committee for Quality Assurance, ranked the health plans of Molina Healthcare among the top Medicaid plans in the United States in their America's Best Health Plans 2005 survey. The rankings of U.S. News & World Report were based on five categories: Access to Care, Overall Satisfaction, Prevention, Treatment, and Overall Quality Score. All of our health plans ranked among the top 50 health plans in the country.

income Americans and the interests of our stockholders could be complementary goals. I remain committed to both of these ideals. Other organizations have taken notice of our ability to reach out to the many that have been traditionally underserved. The California Dental Health Foundation has provided Molina with a grant to assist in the education of primary care physicians regarding oral health for children from birth to age five. In addition, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has provided Molina with a grant to help reduce health outcome disparities among Latino patients. We also used part of the grant in successfully launching TeleSalud, our bilingual Spanish telephone nurse advice line. Examples like these demonstrate how our knowledge, our cultural sensitivity, our experience, and our commitment to quality have given us the qualifications necessary for success. As the states and federal government respond to their own financial challenges and the needs of their citizens, our business environment continues to evolve. So too must we continue to evolve. I am more confident than ever about our ability to do so and to continue to succeed. We look forward to the journey ahead with eagerness. And, as always, we are grateful for your continuing support and your investment. Sincerely,

J. Mario Molina, M.D. We are excited about where we go from here. Molina Healthcare began with a mission to bring quality care to those who need it most but can least afford it. We have always believed that serving the interests of lowPresident and Chief Executive Officer
