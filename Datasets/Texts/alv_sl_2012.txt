04 autoliv 2012 / President’s letter
Dear Shareholder,
in 2012, we continued to deliver on our growth strategy. our organic sales grew by 4% despite the fact that light vehicle production (lvP) in the im- portant Western European market dropped by 8%.
We managed to offset this effect with strong performance in China and in active safety where sales increased by 36%.
We also benefitted from the continued lvP re- covery in North america since the 2008-09 finan- cial crisis and the Japanese lvP rebound after the 2011 tsunami. as a result, we achieved new record sales of $8.3 billion. this was in spite of negative currency effects and a small divestiture.
in addition, 2012 was another year with record order intake which confirms our market leader- ship position.
in light of these achievements, i would like to thank our employees for their hard work and strong contributions in 2012.
aliGninG caPacity locally
in response to the sharp drop in Western Europe- an lvP, we started to implement a capacity align- ment program. We announced it at the beginning of the year, before most companies announced their restructuring programs.
initially, we estimated the cost for our program as “more than $50 million”. in response to the further deterioration in the outlook for European lvP, we raised in april the expected cost to $60-80 million and, in october, to the higher end of that range. Eventually, the cost for the capacity align- ment program ended up at $79 million.
We have also decided to expand the program into 2013 and expect capacity alignments to cost another $25-50 million.
these actions should ensure that we have the right resources in the right place at the right time.
HiGHeR dividendS and inveStmentS
another important achievement during 2012, was our operating cash flow of $689 million. this al- lowed us – in combination with a strong balance sheet – to continue to raise the quarterly divi- dends to shareholders. the dividend per share was first raised from 45 cents to 47 cents for the second and the third quarters and then to 50 cents for the fourth quarter. this came after three dividend increases during 2011. in total, the dividend was raised by 15% between 2011 and 2012, which had the effect of returning 54% of the 2012 “free cash flow” (i.e. net cash before
financing) to shareholders.
the healthy cash flow has also al-
lowed us to invest for the future and to continue to spend almost 4.5% of sales in capital expenditures. these capital investments will not only provide much-needed additional manufacturing capacity in China and other growth markets but also increase our vertical inte- gration. this will thereby en- hance our competitive edge
and mitigate the pricing pressure effect in our industry.
in 2012, we announced autoliv’s largest capital investment ever – a $33 million new gas gener- ant plant in China. this investment, in combina- tion with an expansion of our North american gas generant plant, will provide the potential to grow our global airbag manufacturing capacity by ap- proximately 30%. in addition, we are increasing our North american manufacturing capacity for initia- tors for airbags and for micro gas generators for pyrotechnic seatbelt pretensioners. these capital expenditures will increase our vertical integration and reduce costs, in addition to providing neces- sary additional manufacturing capacity.
in 2012, we also began the extensions of our technical center in China and of our seatbelt as- sembly plant in Hungary. a new assembly facility for airbags and seatbelts was completed in zindo- nesia and a new steering wheel plant in Romania as well as a new seatbelt assembly plant in Russia.
a PRo-active balance SHeet
Despite these higher investments for the future and higher dividends, autoliv’s net cash increased by almost $270 million to more than $360 million at the end of 2012. at present, we believe it is ap- propriate to maintain a strong balance sheet for the following reasons. the uncertain macro envi- ronment could lead to additional needs for capac- ity alignments. We cannot yet estimate how much the ongoing antitrust investigations (see page 43) will cost us. last, but not least, we want to make acquisitions to accelerate autoliv’s growth.
However, when it is possible to assess the financial outcome of these three uncertain vari- ables, it could turn out that our company will have more funds than it will need for its operations. in that case, we could be returning even more funds to shareholders than we currently do.
StRateGy FoR GRowtH
looking ahead, our strategy is based on the ex- pected growth of global lvP as seen from the
  
graph below. lvP is expected by iHS to grow by 23% or almost 20 million light vehicles to nearly 100 million by 2017. However, virtually all of this growth will be concentrated in China and other growth markets, while the traditional light vehicle markets (Western Europe, North america and Japan) are expected to merely rebound to their historical lvP levels before the financial crisis in 2008-2009. as a result of this shift in global lvP, we and the entire automotive industry need to invest in increased capacity in growth markets, where there still is a significant untapped market potential for our passive safety systems. Hence, our relatively high current capital expenditure level.
We also want to grow in the traditional mar- kets in order to expand faster than the automotive safety market, in line with our strategy. the only way to do this is to introduce new technologies, thereby increasing the safety content per vehicle. therefore, we are increasing our R,D&E expenses, net; from 5.0% of sales in 2010 and 5.5% in 2012 to more than 5.5% expected in 2013.
our R,D&E undertakings are paying off in terms of growing sales. For instance, during the past three years, sales of active safety have grown by 73% in 2010 to $85 million, 89% in 2011 to $160 million and by 36% in 2012 to $218 million and are targeted to reach half a billion dollars by 2015.
LIGHT VEHICLE PRODUCTION
our R,D&E spending is also paying off in terms of new products. For instance, in 2012, we, in col- laboration with volvo, introduced the world’s first pedestrian airbag (see photo), which was intro- duced on the volvo v40.
another result of our investments in R,D&E was a new “green” airbag inflator. it leaves no waste products, except for 100% clean water vapor since it uses hydrogen and oxygen to inflate the airbag instead of a traditional “powder”. additionally, the new airbag inflator has 20% less weight than the inflator it is replacing, thereby reducing fuel con- sumption and emissions during the long life of a vehicle.
outlook 2013
2013 is also likely to be a mixed year with contin- ued challenges in Western Europe, balanced by continued growth in the americas, China, Rest of asia and active Safety. therefore, we are pleased that we initiated our capacity alignment program early since it will help us meet the challenges in Europe, although most of the cost savings will be realized in 2014 and 2015.
For the full year 2013, our current data indi- cates an organic sales growth in the range of 1-3%. this is despite an expected organic sales decline of 4% in the first quarter due to a 14%
drop in Western European lvP. Based on this as- sumption, consolidated sales are expected to grow in the range of 2-4% during 2013, provided that the mid-January currency exchange rates prevail.
the indication for the operating margin is around 9% for 2013, excluding costs for capac- ity alignments and antitrust investigations. the capacity alignment costs are currently assumed to reach at least $25 million but not exceed $50 million.
the effective tax rate is projected to be around 27%, excluding discrete items.
operations are expected to continue to generate a strong cash flow in the magnitude of $0.7 billion, while capital expenditures are expected to amount to approximately 4.5% of sales.
Yours sincerely,
Jan Carlson
