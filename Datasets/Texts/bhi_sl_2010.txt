The accomplishments of 2010 marked a significant milestone in our multi-year efforts to transform Baker Hughes and position the company for growth and long-term profitability.
 To Our Stockholders
In 2010, after a year-long effort to obtain full government approval, we completed the acquisition of BJ Services and integrated pressure pumping, coiled tubing and cementing capabilities into our global service offering. We also further reinforced our reservoir capa- bilities through acquisition and realignment of our consulting services; our geographic and business segment organization became fully functional; and, our enterprise-level supply chain effort began to deliver significant cost savings.
In North America, the “unconventional” gas and oil plays became the foundation of our land business, driving demand for directional drilling, advanced completion systems and pressure pumping.
In April 2010, the industry mourned the loss of 11 men working on the Deepwater Horizon. Although we were not involved in the accident, we did provide products and services to help with the capping, relief well and clean-up efforts following the blowout. The accident and associated spill negatively impacted our business in the Gulf of Mexico, as the drilling moratorium, the cre- ation of new regulations, and the pace of permit approval impeded all new drilling activity from late April through the end of the year. Given the difficulty of permitting new wells both in deep water and on the shelf, we saw increased demand for our workover and stimulation services to battle production declines, but not enough to offset the revenue we would have generated from the 33 deepwater rigs that were idled.
The international market entered what we believe to be a multi-year trend of increasing spending as the global industry battles decline curves and invests to satisfy expanding global demand for oil and natural gas.
Financial Results
In 2010, Baker Hughes recorded its highest annual revenue to date, with top-line growth driven by our acquisition of BJ Services. Baker Hughes results for the year include results of BJ Services starting from May 2010.
Revenue for 2010 was $14.41 billion, up 49% compared to $9.66 billion in 2009. Net income attributable to Baker Hughes for 2010 was $812 million or $2.06 per diluted share, compared to $421 million or $1.36 per diluted share for 2009.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or “EBITDA”, for 2010 were $6.63 per diluted share, up 41% from $4.70 for 2009.
Capital expenditures were $1.49 billion, depreciation and amortization expense was $1.07 bil- lion and dividend payments were $241 million in the year 2010.
At the end of 2010, Baker Hughes had $3.88 billion in debt, and cash and short-term invest- ments of $1.71 billion. We also had $1.7 billion undrawn and available under committed credit facilities. Our debt to capital ratio was 21%. Our net debt was $2.2 billion and our net debt to capital ratio was 13%.
Transformation Complete
For the past several years, Baker Hughes has invested in building a diverse global workforce, expanding our infrastructure to support growing markets in North America and internationally, to develop new technology and expand our capabilities to do so, and to deliver products and equip- ment to serve our clients. This investment set the stage for further changes to make us stronger and more competitive.
In May 2009, we announced a fundamental change in Baker Hughes’ organizational struc- ture, moving from a product line organization managed through divisions to a geographic organi- zation managed through geomarkets. The geographic organization has met our objectives of building closer relationships with our customers and developing a more holistic view of the market while maintaining excellence in rig site execution and safety.

 In 2010, we also improved our reservoir consulting and engineering capabilities by forming the Reservoir Development Services group that combines several consulting and software firms acquired since 2008 and other Baker Hughes geotechnical professionals.
On April 28, we received approval from the U.S. Department of Justice to complete our acquisition of BJ Services. And on August 28, following the divestiture of certain Gulf of Mexico businesses and assets, the Department of Justice agreed to the lifting of a Hold Separate Order, allowing the full combination of the U.S. businesses of Baker Hughes and BJ Services. Interna- tional integration was well under way when the divestiture was completed in August, and we were finally able to leverage the full synergies across all product lines globally.

        Beginning in September 2010, when BJ Services’ U.S. operations were formally merged into
Baker Hughes, we moved with agility to leverage the strengths of the legacy Baker Hughes prod-
uct lines with the newly acquired capabilities of BJ Services. We continue to expand our service $100 capabilities. We opened a new service facility in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, and we plan
to invest in enough facilities, equipment and personnel to add one additional pumping spread in
North America every six weeks.
Service intensity continues to increase as customers are planning longer horizontal wells and tighter spacing between frac stages, resulting in more stages and higher demand for hydraulic fracturing.
Depending on the basin, pressure pumping capacity remains tight with backlogs stable at 90–180 days. The supply chain for new equipment is stretched, and we believe that it is unlikely that the industry can increase pressure pumping capacity faster than demand in 2011.

ture to control cost and deliver acceptable margins, especially in regions outside North America.
During 2010, we consolidated geomarkets to match market activity in the Africa, Latin America and Russia Caspian areas, reducing expatriate staff and taking a variety of cost-cutting measures. By the fourth quarter, our Eastern Hemisphere operations had achieved substantial margin improvement. International profit improvement and cost control will be primary areas of focus over the next several quarters.
Our supply chain strategy is paying off, as we achieve efficiencies in manufacturing downhole tools and chemicals while leveraging our combined buying power to control procurement costs. We also are investing in manufacturing capacity in the Eastern Hemisphere to produce products in Asia and the Middle East, closer to our customers. Taken together, supply chain improvements are delivering recurring savings of $100 million per year.
In addition, we are on target to achieve the expected cost efficiencies of $150 million per year from the combination with BJ Services.

 Leveraging Opportunities
The interest in unconventional gas development has spread from North America, and operators in Europe, China, Australia and Latin America have asked us to present our reservoir engineering, horizontal drilling and fracturing technology as they consider accessing shale
gas resources.
Offshore drilling, including deepwater activity, continues to increase, and Baker Hughes remains a leader in this market segment. Despite a slowdown in the Gulf of Mexico, demand for stimulation vessels has been strong. Our new Blue Dolphin and Blue Tarpon vessels bring state-of- the-art technology and the industry’s highest capacity to the market. As a result of the merger we now provide cementing services on 25% of the world’s offshore rigs.

Baker Hughes also has focused on green technology. Using our BJ SmartCareTM program, our experts design and implement frac-fluid programs that minimize environmental impact during hydraulic fracturing.
Outlook
Looking ahead, we expect the economic recovery to create increased oil demand, which should support high oil prices and a sustained multi-year expansion of international spending.
We expect North America land activity to remain strong as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing activity continues to grow. While operators are shifting to liquid and oil reserves, we expect continued significant shale gas drilling, but we are carefully watching natural gas prices and their effect on rig activity.
To help drive growth in 2011, we are planning annual capital expenditures of $2.3 to $2.7 bil- lion, compared to $1.5 billion in 2010. Much of the increase reflects the capital requirements of expanding our pressure pumping business.
In closing, I want to recognize the contributions of our 53,100 employees who so profession- ally serve our customers. Through their dedication we continue to lead our industry segment in safety and have been recognized as leaders in innovation. With the reorganization now in place, the addition of BJ Services, and the slow but steady improvement in global economic conditions, 2011 is off to a good start.
