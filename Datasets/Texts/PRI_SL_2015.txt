Dear Fellow Stockholders,
I'm pleased to report that 2015 was an outstanding year for Primerica. Together with our field leadership, we successfully grew distribution in order to increase long-term earnings. Stellar growth in our Term Life business and positive Investment and Savings Products performance, coupled with share repurchases, drove expansion of operating earnings per share and return on adjusted equity, underscoring the strength of our franchise.

DISTRIBUTION HIGHLIGHTS
We began the year with positive momentum and we executed initiatives to drive organic growth including product enhancements, focused incentive programs, and additional sales force support. We introduced cutting-edge sales tools and real-time recognition programs that appeal to a broader spectrum of representatives. During 2015, Primerica achieved our strongest year of distribution growth since becoming a public company, ending the year with 106,710 lifelicensed representatives, an increase of more than 8% year-over-year. The size of our mutual fund licensed sales force also continued to grow in 2015, up 5% from the end of 2014. Growth of distribution is a key driver of our ability to meet clients' needs and continue to grow our business. Over the past several years, we have enhanced our life insurance products, underwriting technology, and point-of-sale applications to broaden our appeal to middle-market clients. Due to these improvements and our strong distribution growth, we achieved solid growth in key life insurance metrics. Our Term Life business outperformed the life insurance industry in 2015 as our life insurance policies In 2015 Primerica was named one of "America's 50 Most Trustworthy Financial Companies" by Forbes magazine, based on a review of the accounting and governance practices of more than 700 publicly-traded North American companies. issued increased 18%, while the industry's life insurance application activity increased less than 3% year-over-year. Our Term Life insurance adjusted direct premiums grew 11% and we ended the year with more than $693 billion in Term Life insurance face amount in force. Equally important, Primerica delivered more than $1.2 billion in Term Life insurance death claims to Main Street families in 2015. Our Investment and Savings Products (ISP) segment also saw growth with sales increasing 3% to $5.86 billion, the largest year of ISP sales in the history of our company. We achieved positive ISP flows of over $1 billion, despite headwinds from slower market appreciation and a lower Canadian dollar value than the prior year. In July, our biennial convention provided an ideal opportunity to celebrate our accomplishments and set the course for the future. More than 40,000 people from the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico attended this event, where we launched new incentive programs and technology that enhanced our clients' experience, and expanded the business opportunity for our sales force.

PERFORMANCE
One of our competitive advantages is a business model that provides us with a strong ability to generate and deploy capital to drive stockholder value while maintaining our financial strength. During 2015, we increased share repurchases by $50 million to $200 million, enabling us to retire approximately 8% of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Quarterly stockholder dividends were increased to $0.16 per share, which reflected an annual increase of $0.04 per share or 33% over the 2014 dividend. In the first quarter of 2016, we further increased our dividend by $0.01, taking the quarterly stockholder dividend to $0.17 per share. Looking forward, we plan to deploy capital of approximately $150 million in 2016 in addition to stockholder dividends. We are committed to maintaining Primerica's strong balance sheet while utilizing a conservative, high quality investment portfolio. Our reliance on investment returns is relatively low, with a ratio of invested assets and cash to adjusted stockholders' equity at 2.1x and net investment income representing only 5% of our operating revenues in 2015. Primerica Life Insurance Company remains well positioned to fund future growth with a Risk-Based Capital Ratio of approximately 450% at the end of 2015. Our financial strength was confirmed in 2015 when Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and A.M. Best Company affirmed their strong ratings of Primerica, Inc. and Primerica Life Insurance Company. Our solid performance was driven by 10% growth in Term Life net premiums and a 14% increase in Term Life operating income before income taxes. Both Investment and Savings Products sales and average client asset values were slightly higher during 2015, while ISP operating income before income taxes remained consistent year-overyear. Total net operating income grew 5% to $191.1 million versus 2014, due largely to solid business growth with a modest increase in insurance and other operating expenses in 2015. The weakening Canadian dollar value during 2015 negatively impacted net operating income by approximately $7 million, and net investment income continued to experience downward pressure in 2015 primarily due to market conditions, lower yield on invested assets, and continued share repurchases throughout the year. Despite these headwinds, we achieved a 12% increase in diluted net operating income per share, and a 160 basis points increase in return on adjusted equity (ROAE) to 16.9% compared with 2014 due to solid earnings and significant share repurchases in 2015. We expect ROAE to continue to expand in 2016. Despite record results in 2015, the uncertainty surrounding the Department of Labor's (DOL) proposed fiduciary rule pressured Primerica's stock price which underperformed the total return of the S&P 500 in 2015. Our team continues to work diligently to develop a plan to comply with the DOL rule. We are confident we can make the business adjustments needed to ensure middle-income families continue to have access to sound investment advice for retirement savings.

In April 2015, Primerica celebrated the five-year anniversary of our IPO. The  April 1 anniversary included a special event and ringing the closing bell of the New York Stock Exchange with home office and field leaders in attendance.

LOOKING AHEAD
We believe our financial strength and solid business model will continue to deliver strong results to stockholders. Our dedicated team of independent sales representatives and home office employees is executing against our objectives and remaining focused on maximizing our opportunities. Our business has never been stronger. With almost 107,000 life insurance licensed representatives and nearly 24,000 mutual fund licensed representatives, Primerica is ideally positioned to meet the financial needs of Main Street families. We are proud of our accomplishments in 2015 and truly believe the best is yet to come as we continue to grow. Thank you for your investment in Primerica.

Sincerely,

Glenn J. Williams Chief Executive Officer
