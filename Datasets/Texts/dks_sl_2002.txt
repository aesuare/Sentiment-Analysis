AN EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM ENABLES US TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO MARKETPLACE AND CUSTOMER DYNAMICS.

DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS,

For Dick's Sporting Goods, 2002 was a remarkable year, one in which our company reached new milestones and continued to demonstrate industry-leading performance. The most visible milestone outside the company this past year was the successful completion of our IPO in October in what was and continues to be a very challenging market environment. Transitioning to a public company and operating in such a difficult retail environment is a testament to our 9,000 associates that make this company run every day. At the end of 2002, Dick's Sporting Goods operated 141 stores in 25 states. We were the second largest full-line sporting goods retailer with sales of $1.27 billion and reported the largest fourth quarter sales volume of all full-line sporting goods retailers. Most importantly, for the fifth consecutive year, Dick's Sporting Goods was the most profitable full-line sporting goods retailer in the country, exceeding our nearest competitor's earnings by approximately 65%, as measured by income from continuing operations and adjusted for our competitors' non-recurring items. This industry-leading performance continues to prove our associates are executing against our mission statement of "redefining sports and fitness specialty retailing for all athletes and outdoor enthusiasts through quality brands, information, technology and superior service." Our focus has been very different than others in this industry, as we have always focused on the authentic athlete and outdoor enthusiast. This strategy has reduced the impact of fashion changes on our performance. Our business is comprised of 60% hardlines, 20% apparel and 20% footwear, with the majority of our apparel and footwear business targeted toward the athlete and outdoor enthusiast. This allows our results to be more predictable and our business easier to scale, and our results bear this out. Our business is also built on a foundation of solid financial discipline as evidenced by our industry-leading results over the past five years. In 2002, in an economic environment that could be characterized as difficult at best, our financial results were exceptional. Our sales increased by 18% to approximately $1.27 billion, and our net income increased by 63%, from $23.5 million to $38.3 million.

Most importantly, this performance was balanced across all aspects of the business. Comparable store sales increased by 5.1% for the year and was at approximately that level for all four quarters, despite the soft economy; our gross margin expanded by 200 bps, growing from 24.5% of sales to 26.5%; and we turned our inventory at a rate of 3.83x, 56% higher than the mean of sporting goods retailers at 2.45x. As a result, our return on invested capital increased from 10.7% in 2001 to 11.8% in 2002. This is a significant year-over-year increase and clearly demonstrates our discipline in allocating capital appropriately to those projects that deliver the appropriate returns. While we are gratified by another year of outstanding performance, our focus remains on the future. It is a new year and we are faced with a very competitive industry, a challenging economic environment and an uncertain geopolitical backdrop. Notwithstanding those challenges, though, we understand that expectations are high and that we need to demonstrate the execution and continued financial performance that has come to be expected from us. In delivering that performance, we will continue to rely on the competitive strengths outlined on the pages that follow. We believe these provide a fundamental competitive advantage as we move closer to our goal of becoming not only one of the best sporting goods retailers in the nation, but also one of the best retailers in any class. Our ultimate success, of course, depends on the efforts and support of our associates, our customers, our vendors and our shareholders. On behalf of our management team, we thank all of you for your many contributions and look forward to achieving new milestones in the years ahead.

Edward W. Stack
CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
