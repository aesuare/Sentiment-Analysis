For the year under review, the wholly-owned harness factory in Huizhou, China continued to report strong growth in both revenue and net profit due to successful development in new automotive camera harness for export and business expansion in China's domestic market. While the company has become  an  active Tier 2 harness suppliers in China, it has embarked on programs to penetrate into Tier 1 business covering automotive camera assembly, and engine and full body harness. For the coming few years, the company is studying plans to develop satellite factories in strategic locations in China to serve the local  requirements while operating the existing plant in Huizhou as the centre of excellence.

GP Batteries
The core battery business of GP Batteries has been reasonably stable during the year. With the termination of the Vectrix project, GP Batteries  will  re-focus  on the core battery businesses and will de-emphasize investment into vehicle businesses.

The revenue for the financial year was S$695 million, 4% lower than the revenue reported last year.  Sales  of rechargeable batteries declined by 12% while sales of primary batteries increased by 2%. With improved factory productivity, gross profit margin improved from 20.9% to 22.5%.

After the impairment losses and provisions, GP Batteries reported a loss after taxation attributable to its equity holders of S$52.0 million for the year, compared to S$16.2 million last year.

GP Batteries generated an operating cash surplus of S$54.5 million, compared to S$26.6 million last year. As at 31 March 2014, the gearing ratio stood at a record low of 23% with net bank borrowings significantly reduced to S$57.9 million from S$125.8 million as at  31 March 2013.

Other investments
The business segment contributed S$11.5 million profit before exceptional items, compared to S$7.1 million last year. Contribution from Meiloon Industrial Co., Ltd. increased primarily  due  to  share  of   a  property   disposal   gain of  approximately  S$10.4  million.  Profit  contribution from Linkz Industries Limited decreased slightly. The segment reported a total exceptional loss of S$16.1 million compared to S$7.9 million last year.
 
Outlook
Despite the reported loss, the Group's financial position remains healthy with net bank borrowings reduced significantly  from  S$178.7  million  to S$91.7 million. The improved balance sheet will provide an opportunity for the Group to expand and possibly make new investment.
While some of the Group's electronics and acoustics business in Europe may continue to be affected by the weak consumer demand, the business in the US, China and some Asian markets is expected to remain  stable.

Automotive wire harness business will continue its gro wth.

The overall battery  market  is  stable  but  as  the nickel metal hydride battery market is not growing, competition for this market segment  will  intensify. With the cessation of the Vectrix project, GP Batteries will focus on the core battery business and is on the way to return to profit and growth. Sales momentum carried forward from the last quarter of the financial year ended 31 March 2014 is expected to continue in the financial year 2014-2015.

The Group will continue to invest in product innovation and further develop its brands and global distribution network. It is also expanding the production capacity for its electronics and acoustics business as well as some product categories of the battery business . In addition, it will continue to automate its factories to improve productivity.
