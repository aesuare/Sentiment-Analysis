TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

T

he year 2000 was another challenging year for DIMON and the tobacco industry. Global demand for leaf tobacco remained below historical levels as the world market continued to adjust to earlier disruptions caused by economic conditions in Asia and Eastern Europe, and by the price-induced decline in U.S. tobacco consumption resulting from the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. Numerous mergers within our customer base also served to rationalize their raw material inventories and lessen demand for tobacco leaf. Despite the difficulties within our operating environment, this was also the year that DIMON returned to profitability, as our senior management team carried to fruition the strategic plan initiated in 1999. DIMON's 2000 performance was solidly in line with our expectations for profitability and reflects the success of our operating strategy focused on three key areas: adjusting our global production

capacity to current demand, strengthening our balance sheet, and reducing our operating costs. The relentless pursuit of these objectives by our management team, coupled with the dedicated efforts of our employees and the vital support of our customers, enabled us to achieve the following: · Through the comprehensive worldwide rationalization of our processing facilities and reallocation of resources, we aligned our production capacity and operating cost structure with market conditions to raise DIMON's gross margin to 12.7 percent of sales compared to 8.6 percent last year, despite smaller volumes processed. · In addition to reducing production costs, our restructuring and other cost-cutting activities drove a significant decline in selling, general and administrative expenses, which declined by more than $11 million, or 9.5 percent in comparison to the prior year.

· Since the inception of this strategic plan, enhanced asset management has enabled us to reduce overall inventories and advances by nearly $350 million, while bringing uncommitted inventories down to optimal operating levels. · The resultant positive cash flow from operations allowed DIMON to reduce total debt by more than $400 million, enhancing operating flexibility and lowering interest expense despite a higher interest rate environment. In combination, these strategic initiatives contributed to DIMON's return to solid profitability. Our net income per share for the year ended June 30, 2000 was $.40, a dramatic turnaround from last year's loss of ($.44) per share from continuing operations before non-recurring items. Like you, we continue to be frustrated that our performance improvement has yet to be reflected in our share price. While DIMON is not involved, ongoing litigation in which our customers are parties, compounded by extensive media coverage, has kept

industry valuations down. In addition, amidst the market's current favor for technology issues, traditional measurements for finding value seem to be largely ignored. Thus, our very significant operating achievements, including many technology-driven innovations employed to improve performance, are not resonating with investors. While the strength of our underlying fundamentals is not being reflected in today's stock price, I am confident that, over time, DIMON's stock price will more accurately reflect the value we are building. We are very pleased to have achieved essentially all of our near-term operating objectives, but we recognize the extreme importance of continuing our proactive management approach. Our focus in the coming year will be to improve upon the costefficiencies already implemented, further strengthen our balance sheet, and continue to enhance our strategic customer relationships ­ with the goal of positioning DIMON as the industry's best operator. Our leadership is evident in our pursuit of ISO 9002 certification, which allows us to consistently replicate

products and services of superior quality for our customers, track customer satisfaction and achieve continuous improvement. DIMON has already achieved certification to the ISO 9002 standards for our operations in the United States, Brazil and Zimbabwe. Our longer-term objective is to receive ISO 9002 certification at all DIMON owned and operated processing facilities worldwide within the next three to five years. DIMON's investment in Internet technology to enhance customer service and logistics is further testament to our leadership, and will continue to be a high management priority. We have already succeeded in the global implementation of Internet technology that enables the efficient coordination of our sales and logistics personnel across the more than 30 countries in which we operate. The progress of every customer order is tracked worldwide with real-time status reports provided to every DIMON employee directly engaged in customer service activities. We are now identifying opportunities

to link our back office operations with customers to eliminate information barriers and further enhance our customer service capabilities. While we can't predict what the future will bring, it undoubtedly holds changes and challenges, as well as more opportunities. Accordingly, we are looking to the future with anticipation and enthusiasm. While there are uncertainties surrounding the U.S. tobacco program and auction system, as well as the ongoing political and civil unrest in Zimbabwe, concurrently, we believe that our customers' raw material inventories are trending toward equilibrium with their production forecasts, allowing for the return to more normal purchasing patterns. Also, despite declines in the United States, worldwide consumption of tobacco products continues to grow, with a continuing trend among consumers to trade up to American Blend tobacco cigarettes. As DIMON handles a substantial share of the world market for internationally traded leaf tobacco used

to produce American Blend cigarettes, we view these trends with optimism. Our confidence in the future is bolstered by the knowledge that the concerted efforts and experience of our management team and our employees, combined with our focused strategy, are capable of both delivering near-term success and building long-term value. I am humbled by the unfaltering dedication of our employees and wish to convey my sincere gratitude for their continued efforts on behalf of the Company. Of course, the essence of our success stems from our valued customers, who give us the opportunity to serve. To those customers, we extend our appreciation and renew our commitment to ensuring their satisfaction. We recognize and thank Albert C. Monk III, DIMON's former Vice Chairman who retired December 31, 1999, for his thirty-eight years of service to the Company. We are fortunate that Mr. Monk continues to serve on the Board of Directors. We also pay tribute to

Senator Richard J. Holland, a longtime Director of Dibrell Brothers, a DIMON predecessor, and respected member of the Virginia Senate since 1979, who passed away in April. On behalf of our senior management team and the Board of Directors, we thank you for your support. We are proud of the great strides DIMON has achieved over the past year. We look forward to working just as hard in the coming year to earn your continued support and to provide you with solid returns on your investment in DIMON. Sincerely,

Brian J. Harker
President and Chief Executive Officer
