This past year we took major steps to implement our key strategy of raising Hughes to the next level of leadership in high-growth communications services markets. These activities reflected a rewarding first year for us as a pure play satellite and wireless communications company, a year in which we continued to leverage our systems expertise to gain competitive advantages in our service businesses. It was a year of achievement, a year of challenges, a year in which we extended our lead in all four of our primary business segments. In 1998, Hughes Space and Communications Company (HSC) won more than 50 percent of its competitive bids, as it has for each of the past several years. Hughes Network Systems (HNS)

And our DIRECTV businesses around the world continued to expand, highlighted by record subscriber growth in the United States. At the end of 1998 and the beginning of 1999, Hughes announced key acquisitions that will change the landscape of American video entertainment. We signed agreements to acquire United States Satellite Broadcasting (USSB), the assets of PRIMESTAR, and Tempo's two high-power satellites and related spectrum. When completed, these transactions will give DIRECTV ® a stronger, simpler retail offering; expanded capacity to provide more than 370 channels; increased revenuegenerating opportunities; and a subscriber base of 7 million ­ making it the third largest multi-channel system

continued to lead the world with its more than 55 percent market share in satellite-based, interactive private business networks. PanAmSat, the world's leading commercial satellite services company, strengthened its position with three launches that increased its fleet size to 19 satellites.

The accomplishments of the past year were all the more impressive because they were achieved in spite of some challenges. Responding to the outage of PanAmSat's Galaxy IV satellite and anomalies with other Hughes-built spacecraft, we corrected the problems in our newer satellites and are raising our industry-leading

quality standards to an even higher level. In our service businesses, we're expanding our PanAmSat and DIRECTV satellite fleets to equip them with unmatched in-orbit back-up capabilities. These additions, together with ground-spare satellites that can be launched on an expedited basis, will ensure that we have the capacity needed to provide the highest quality of service for our customers. Although concerns have arisen about technology transfers to China, Hughes has complied with the law and acted in accordance with the guidance of Executive Branch agencies with respect to the export of technology. In response to the concerns, Hughes not only has undertaken an effort to review and revise our export policies and procedures, but is providing industry leadership in compliance efforts. Hughes is committed to working with the applicable government agencies to ensure that the U.S. satellite industry can compete internationally, while at the same time providing every assurance that our national security interests have been fully protected. Looking ahead, the burgeoning growth rates of communications create an environment of unprecedented opportunity. Taken as a whole, the communications industry is forecast to surpass $1 trillion in the next two years, and the portion addressable by satellites is expected to exceed $70 billion.

To exploit these opportunities, in the coming years we will continue to emphasize our strategy of strengthening our leadership position in all of our primary businesses, with a particular focus on the rapidly expanding communications services markets. For example, in 1999 DIRECTV will introduce a new generation of interactive services that will transform the television from an entertainment and information resource into an interactive multimedia portal in the home. From the comfort of their living rooms, subscribers will be able to browse the Internet, engage in electronic commerce, conduct banking, view localized weather reports, or play interactive games on their televisions. Pioneering time-shifting technology will be incorporated into DIRECTV receivers, allowing DIRECTV subscribers to personalize their television viewing experience. Customers will have the ability to "pause" a live TV broadcast or pay-per-view movie, and to watch favorite shows on their own schedules, not the networks'. Subscribers will be able to create their own programming lineups ­ and even "teach" the TV their viewing likes and dislikes. With the anticipated new capacity obtained from our recently announced transactions, DIRECTV will also be able to provide an

exceptional and expanded range of service offerings. These include high definition television (HDTV), á la carte and niche services, and specialty channels dedicated to topics such as family programming, education and religion. We will increase our offerings of exclusive programming, such as the NFL SUNDAY TICKET, which features virtually every National Football League game. In fact, we have extended our agreement to remain the exclusive small-dish provider of this NFL package through at least 2002. We are also taking important steps to improve the performance and value of our DIRECTV businesses in Latin America and Japan. In Mexico, for example, we have increased our equity position in the local operating company so that we can provide greater guidance in day-to-day operations. In Japan, a partnership restructuring in early 1999 strengthened the management team while increasing Hughes' ownership and influence in operating the business. In our other major services business, PanAmSat, we plan to deploy six new satellites by mid-2000. This will allow us to increase our transponder capacity by over 60 percent to meet the rapidly rising global demand for video broadcasting, Internet access and other services while still providing the industry's best in-orbit back-up capability. In executing our strategy to extend our leadership, Hughes has a

number of strengths to draw on that are unique to the industry. For example, our numerous orbital slots and spectrum are strategically located around the globe to provide critical platforms for growth in our service businesses. And we have a strong balance sheet to support this anticipated growth. Additionally, our unparalleled range of systems and system technology provides our service businesses with a competitive advantage. One of the most recent examples of such synergies was the 1998 performance of HNS in gearing up to produce additional DIRECTVTM receiving equipment. When our other suppliers could not meet the unexpected boom in demand, HNS more than quadrupled its production to become the number two provider of set-top boxes, which played a key role in DIRECTV's ability to achieve its record growth in the United States. This type of teamwork will reach a new level as Hughes pioneers the next generation of satellite communications ­ broadband services.These high-speed, high-bandwidth services include applications such as Internet access, corporate intranets and extranets, desk-top videoconferencing, and distance learning. Beginning in 2002, SpacewayTM will offer service providers the ability to supply their customers with ultra-fast, two-way communi-

cations of data and video in North America using antennas as small as 26 inches. We envision creating a global platform that will begin with a geosynchronous system and expand to include non-geosynchronous satellites as the technology and markets evolve. We will build this new capability by capitalizing on the best talents at each of our businesses. For example, HSC will provide the cutting-edge HS 702 satellites, while HNS will develop the ground infrastructure. HNS' role will include designing the receiving equipment and ground network; providing expertise and insight into the business network markets; and using the Spaceway platform to offer new and expanded services to its base of existing customers.

PanAmSat will operate the satellites and act as a reseller of Spaceway capacity in certain markets, while DIRECTV will cross-sell the services to its customers. Spaceway is achievable owing to our level of vertical integration, and is one more example of our unrivaled capability to deliver services that are ever more responsive to customers' needs. In an environment where consumers, businesses and national infrastructures are becoming ever more dependent on space-based communications, Hughes is on course to realize its vision of being the premier global provider of integrated entertainment and information services and products.
