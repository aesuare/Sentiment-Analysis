To Our Shareholders

Fiscal 2006 was another year of accomplishment and outstanding results for Joy Global. It was a record year for orders, shipments and earnings. This was an even greater accomplishment because it was achieved with softness in the North American thermal coal market and while investing in the future growth and capability of our two businesses. Order growth in 2006 was strong in our surface business, but tempered in the underground business by the softness in North American coal. However, strong performance from our other markets resulted in positive order growth in both businesses. This clearly demonstrates the benefit of our diverse presence over geographies and commodities. Aftermarket orders were particularly strong in 2006, demonstrating the benefits of our Life Cycle Management programs and the growing field population of our equipment. We have historically grown our aftermarket despite downturns in original equipment. This was the case again in 2006 for the North American underground segment as aftermarket orders held up despite softness in original equipment. Our focus on process efficiency and strong cost control allowed us to leverage our revenue growth into improved profitability. EBIT margins rose to 18.4 percent of revenues, and reached the target range we set just a few years ago. Both geographic and commodity diversification and Life Cycle Management allowed us to deliver outstanding results in 2006. At Joy Global, we are strongly committed to achieving consistently high levels of performance. You can see that in a variety of programs and initiatives underway in both of our businesses. Much of our long-term growth will come from new markets, such as the oil sands, and the emerging markets. We emphasize the development of these key markets, and have invested in service expansions or additions in Canada, China, Russia, and Poland. We are also completing our first equipment factory in China to serve this market and to be a low cost supplier to our worldwide operations. As we expand in high growth markets, we are adding realizable capacity in mature markets via internal improvements that eliminate bottlenecks and streamline processes. The overall result is to increase capacity without adding roofline. In the last three years, we have reduced our worldwide footprint by 15% while more than doubling our revenue per square foot of facility. The Stamler business was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2006, and will expect to add over $150 million of complimentary revenues in 2007 at margins comparable to our existing businesses. More importantly, Stamler will allow us to expand our product offering and service coverage to our customers. Strong working capital control, low cash taxes, and modest capital spending allowed us to generate significant cash flow again in 2006. We used this to fund the Stamler acquisition and to buy back $300 million of stock. We placed $400 million of investment grade, long-term bonds in November, and will use this to continue stock buybacks under our $1 billion authorization. In fact, we purchased an additional $200 million through calendar-end 2006. As we enter 2007, we find ourselves three years into a strong mining and commodities cycle. The fundamentals and outlook continue to be strong, and this will be a long-term up-cycle primarily driven by industrialization of the emerging markets. However, growth will not be uniform and there will be periodic areas of softness, as we are currently experiencing in North American coal. We are well positioned for this future with our continued focus on strong strategic direction, operational excellence and financial performance. Finally, I would like to congratulate John Hanson on his outstanding record as our CEO. He guided this company from emergence to industry leading performance in just five years, and along the way earned the respect of all who know him. John leaves a great legacy that we intend to continue, and a tremendous record that we plan to emulate.
