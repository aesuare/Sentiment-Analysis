Global reach. Personal service. In pictures, our Annual Report tells the story of how Marriott International has become the world’s leading lodging company—not just through
its diverse portfolio of 3,000 lodging properties, representing 19 brands in almost 70 countries and territories—but by training and engaging the very best employees to deliver exceptional service. In the end, success depends on the guest experience and hospitality delivered by the 300,000 employees at our managed and
franchised hotels worldwide.
This legendary service is the foundation of Marriott
International and owes its success to our unique culture, which values opportunity and respects the goals and aspirations of our people. This, combined with a solid management team and our tested business model of managing and franchising hotels owned by others, has provided us with a significant competitive advantage.
We have stayed true to these pillars even as we continue to innovate. It’s why we are able to report another solid year in 2007.
Our worldwide systemwide Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) rose 6.5 percent in 2007, driven by strong demand from our best corporate customers and other busi- ness travelers. More than 20 percent of our fee revenue derives from properties located outside North America.
With our owners and franchisees, we added more than 200 properties to our system. Full year incentive manage- ment fees totaled a record-breaking $369 million in 2007, up 31 percent over the prior year. We generated diluted

earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $1.75
for 2007, an increase of 6 percent, as we and our hotel owners improved profit margins in our hotels by more than 1.5 percentage points. These strong improvements in hotel-level profitability resulted from efficiencies achieved through technology and workforce effectiveness. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $778 million in 2007.
We’re committed to delivering value to shareholders and
in 2007 we returned nearly $1.9 billion to our investors through share repurchases and dividends. The company repurchased 41 million shares for $1.8 billion in 2007, and at year-end 2007 we had 33 million shares remaining in buybacks authorized by our Board. Return on invested capital for 2007 topped 25 per- cent, nearly double our performance just four years ago.
Building Our Brands
With the introduction of two new brands in 2007, Marriott’s portfolio encompasses nearly every segment of the lodging and timeshare industries. At the same time, two of our proven brands will celebrate milestones in 2008—Marriott Hotels & Resorts will welcome its 500th hotel, and Courtyard its 800th.
We are very excited about the launch of “Edition,” a new genre of lifestyle brand that will combine the intimate and unique lodging experience invented by the visionary pioneer Ian Schrager with Marriott’s development scale and operational expertise. We expect the portfolio to reach more than 100 hotels worldwide, and have signed preliminary agreements on nine hotels in such world-class destinations as Paris, Madrid, Costa Rica, Miami, Washington, D.C., Chicago and Los Angeles.
Through a partnership with Nickelodeon, the top kids’ entertainment brand, Marriott plans to capture the hearts of
our younger customers and the young at heart — their parents. Powered by Nickelodeon’s irreverent and fun entertainment, these upscale resorts will feature state-of-the-art spas, pools and water parks, and live entertainment starring Nick characters.
Our full-service brands—Marriott Hotels & Resorts and
the uniquely stylish Renaissance Hotels & Resorts—are transforming their public spaces to encourage guests to work and socialize there, incorporating the latest design, technology
and food and beverage offerings. To date, 20 lobbies have been redesigned, with another 80 anticipated by 2009. Featured in this report, the Renaissance New York Hotel Times Square showcases this new concept, and how our owners are infusing the brand with a nearly $2 billion investment in new hotel construction, conversions and renovations.
Building on the surging global demand for luxury, The Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, L.L.C. has increased its develop- ment pace with 2007 hotel openings in Beijing, Dallas, Dublin, Vail, Col., Moscow, and Tokyo. The Ritz-Carlton plans to double its portfolio over the next eight years, leveraging its reputation to create new opportunities with The Ritz-Carlton Residences®. The Ritz-Carlton has scored a virtual “sweep” of prestigious number one rankings in recent surveys by J.D. Power and Associates and Consumer Reports. Our JW Marriott Hotels & Resorts brand, which offers relaxed luxury, will reach 50 hotels and resorts in 22 countries by July 2009.
In 2007, Residence Inn debuted a breakthrough integrated marketing campaign, “Master the Long TripSM.” The TV and print ads feature “feat performers” who demonstrate the brand’s dramatic support to business travelers on long stays and high- light the new décor, which includes stainless steel appliances, granite kitchen countertops, and more luxurious bedding.
Courtyard is gaining traction from reinvented hotels and new unit growth, and customers will be delighted by the brand’s contemporary new lobby design with its cutting-edge technology platform. Courtyard is growing dramatically outside the United States, entering new markets such as the Czech Republic, El Salvador, Japan and Thailand.
Our moderate TownePlace Suites brand is reinventing itself to meet the needs of a growing segment of self-sufficient, value- conscious travelers on extended stays. Warm and functional lobbies with a floor-to-ceiling TowneMap® encourage guests to gather and share great places to eat, shop and relax.
SpringHill Suites is evolving to capture the upper-moderate lifestyle category. It continues its rapid growth, with more than 175 hotels across the United States and Canada at year-end 2007 and more than 120 more in its pipeline, including those that combine lodging, retail and residential space.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007

Fairfield Inn and Fairfield Inn & Suites is our fastest-growing brand, rejuvenated by an aggressive “plant and prune” strategy. The brand expects to expand from more than 535 hotels at year-end 2007 to 700 hotels over the next three years.
Fueling Our Growth
When the JW Marriott Hotel Beijing, designated our 3,000th hotel, opened this year, it symbolized the company’s tremen- dous global growth, especially in Asia. Both the JW Marriott Hotel Beijing and The Ritz-Carlton, Beijing look forward to welcoming the world to China for the 2008 Olympic Games. We operate more than 30 hotels in China, and we expect to open another 24 through 2010. In India, we have six hotels and 18 more scheduled to open through 2010. In Thailand, we have nine hotels and 12 more in our pipeline.
In the Middle East, including Egypt, we operate or franchise 28 hotels, with more than 25 in the pipeline.
The company’s worldwide pipeline of hotels under construc- tion, awaiting conversion or approved for development totals approximately 800 hotels and 125,000 rooms. More than
60 percent of our full-service pipeline is outside the United States. We expect to open 85,000 to 100,000 rooms from 2008 through 2010.
Our timeshare business continues to be a strong source of revenue across four brands, from traditional weekly vacation ownership to fractional ownership. As the number of affluent U.S. households continues to rise, Marriott expects growth in this category.
Customer loyalty remains high. Today, over 370,000 time- share owners possess an average of 1.3 weeks. Eighty percent of those owners redeem their investments for a “Marriott experi- ence” at one of our timeshare properties or Marriott-branded hotels, or exchange them for Marriott Rewards points.
We have entered the Asian timesharing market with our Asia Pacific points program, providing leisure travelers in that rapidly growing region with more vacation opportunities. In 2008, we expect contract sales at new properties to begin in Kauai, Hawaii; Orlando and Singer Island in Florida; and Lake Tahoe, Calif., where our Grand Residences by Marriott and Marriott’s Timber Lodge® were both recently recognized by Condé Nast Traveler as among the top 50 ski hotels in North America.
Technology remains one of our strongest competitive advan- tages, especially when combined with our global distribution. Technology powers Marriott Rewards, our award-winning guest loyalty program with over 28 million members, and Marriott.com, one of the world’s top 10 retail Web sites, with $5.2 billion in gross revenue, including referrals to its customer care group.

Marriott.com is customized for nine countries, and is available on your PDA or Internet-enabled phone.
By the end of 2009, we project that nearly all of our hotels
in the United States will have high-definition flat-screen TVs. Our unique plug-in panel, which is in 40,000 Marriott Hotels & Resorts and Renaissance rooms, enables guests to easily connect their iPods, digital cameras, camcorders and laptops to the TV.
Connecting with our customers has never been more important, and over the next three years, we are realigning our sales organization so that corporate and group customers can work with a primary point of contact. This new structure will reduce duplication, enable us to call on more customers and help us serve them even better.
We are also in touch with more customers through social media and online video. With nearly 350,000 visits to our podcast and blog, “Marriott on the Move,” we can interact with thousands of guests. Plus, people visiting the blog have booked more than $3 million in gross sales. We also have videos on YouTube.com, which is a fun way to learn about our company.
Sustaining Our Progress
Sustainability means being a good corporate citizen and environmental steward, and promoting economic growth, diversity and inclusion in our communities worldwide. Guided by our Board of Directors, we have exceeded our objective to spend $1 billion with diverse suppliers three years ahead of schedule, and are expanding our efforts into the United Kingdom and Brazil. Through continued outreach, we now have nearly 450 hotels owned or under development by minorities and women — close to our goal of 500 by 2010.
In partnership with Conservation International, Marriott is ramping up its efforts to integrate environmental and sustainable practices into its business in 2008 in four key areas: supply chain; green buildings; waste, water and energy; and employee and guest engagement. This strategy builds on the company’s established plans to get greener, including an effort to reduce greenhouse gases by nearly 415,000 metric tons by 2010. At our headquarters building, we have become waste neutral through an aggressive recycling and composting program, and by replacing 20 tons of Styrofoam and plastic a year with biodegradable products.
The Future Beckons
Our ability to grow, innovate and deliver superb service, combined with our tested, highly successful business model, positions us to perform well in a wide range of economic scenarios. We’re looking forward to our future — the best is yet to come.
