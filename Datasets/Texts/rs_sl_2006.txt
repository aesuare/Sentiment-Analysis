To Our Shareholders
2006 was a very busy and exciting year for Reliance. We reported our best-ever financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and significantly transformed our company in terms of size, geographic spread, customer and product diversification and capital structure. We completed four acquisitions during 2006 and another three in the first two months of 2007. Our 2006 acquisitions included Earle M. Jorgensen Company, our largest acquisition to-date and first acquisition of a public company (formerly NYSE:JOR), and Yarde Metals, Inc., our second- largest acquisition to-date in terms of revenue.
We are very pleased with our 2006 financial results. For the 2006 fiscal year, net income amounted to a record $354.5 million, up 73% compared with net income of $205.4 million for the same period in 2005. Earnings per diluted share were $4.82 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2006, compared with earnings of $3.10 per diluted share for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2005. Sales for the 2006 fiscal year were a record $5.7 billion, an increase of 71% compared with 2005 fiscal year sales of $3.4 billion.
All share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two-for- one common stock split effective July 19, 2006. The 2006 financial results include $1.6 billion from the combined revenues of Yarde Metals, Inc. that was acquired on August 1, 2006, and Earle M. Jorgensen Company that was acquired on April 3, 2006. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding increased about 11% in 2006 due to the issuance of our common stock related to the Jorgensen acquisition.
In April of 2006, we completed our acquisition of Jorgensen. The transaction was valued at about $984 million, including the assumption of net debt of approximately $253 million. We paid about 50% of the purchase price in cash and the other 50% by issuing approximately nine million shares of our common stock. Using our stock in an acquisition

was immediately accretive to our earnings and significantly broadened and strengthened our product offerings and meaningfully expanded our existing geographic network by adding Jorgensen’s 40 facilities, and brought Canada into our geographic mix. Additionally, Jorgensen brought a new customer base of energy-related businesses that utilize Jorgensen’s specialty long products. Jorgensen’s net sales for their fiscal year ended March 31, 2006 were $1.8 billion. Jorgensen has a strong and experienced management team and we look forward to the opportunities we see for future growth and success from this new subsidiary.

In August of 2006, we completed the acquisition of Yarde Metals,
a metals service center company headquartered in Southington, Connecticut. We paid $100 million in cash and assumed approximately $101 million of net debt for all of the outstanding common stock of Yarde. This acquisition was also immediately accretive to our earnings. Yarde was founded in 1976 and specializes in the processing and distribution of stainless steel and aluminum plate, rod and bar products. Yarde has additional metals service centers in Pelham, New Hampshire; East Hanover, New Jersey; Hauppauge, New York; High Point,
North Carolina; Streetsboro, Ohio; and Limerick, Pennsylvania and
a sales office in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Yarde’s net sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2006 were approximately $385 million. This transaction also significantly enhanced our presence in the Northeast region of the U.S.
Also in 2006, we purchased the remaining 49.5% interest in American Steel, L.L.C. on January 3rd, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. On March 1, 2006, Reliance Pan Pacific Pte., Ltd., our Singapore joint venture company that we formed in late 2005, acquired Everest Metals (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., a metals service center company near Shanghai, People’s Republic of China. We own 70% of Reliance Pan Pacific. Everest Metals sells primarily aluminum products to the electronics industry and contributed approximately $6 million to our 2006 revenues. On March 27, 2006, through our Precision Strip, Inc. subsidiary, we purchased certain assets and the business of Flat Rock Metal Processing, L.L.C. This increased Precision Strip’s operating facilities to 10, with the addition of Flat Rock locations in Perrysburg, Ohio and Portage, Indiana. Precision Strip’s facilities process metal for
a fee without taking ownership of the metal (toll-processing), which is
a high margin business for us.

facility with a $1.1 billion five-year, unsecured syndicated credit facility that provides increased availability of funds and more favorable pricing. This facility may be increased to up to $1.6 billion at our request
with approval from the lenders. We used funds from our increased
line to purchase, in a tender offer, approximately $250 million of the 9.75% senior secured notes issued by Jorgensen in 2002. We then issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes and used the proceeds to pay down the borrowings under our credit facility. This included $350 million of 10-year notes at 6.20% and $250 million of 30-year

notes at 6.85%. The notes are investment grade rated Baa3 by Moody’s and BBB- by Standard & Poor’s. These activities lowered our cost of capital and significantly increased our availability to fund our working capital and general corporate needs, including acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividend payments and stock repurchases.
Our 2006 organic growth rate was strong at about 6%, excluding the impact of pricing. We expanded existing facilities and added new ones in response to increased customer demand for our products and services and to take advantage of strategic opportunities in the domestic marketplace. Our subsidiary Liebovich Bros., Inc. opened a facility near Green Bay, Wisconsin, our first entry into this state; and our subsidiary Phoenix Corporation opened a facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to penetrate that market with their products. We expanded some of our existing facilities and updated our processing equipment in many key markets, spending a record $109 million on capital expenditures in 2006. Because of the favorable environment, we expect to continue our strong organic growth in 2007 and have budgeted capital expenditures of $130 million to support this growth.
In February of 2007, we acquired the Encore Group of metals
service center companies (Encore Metals, Encore Metals (USA), Inc.,
Encore Coils, and Team Tube in Canada) headquartered in Edmonton,
Alberta, Canada. Encore was organized in 2004 in connection with the
buyout by management and a private equity fund managed by HSBC
Capital (Canada) Inc. of certain former Corus CIC and Corus America
businesses. Encore specializes in the processing and distribution of alloy
and carbon bar and tube, as well as stainless steel sheet, plate and bar and
carbon steel flat-rolled products, through its 17 facilities located mainly

in Western Canada adds further to our diversification strategy in a robust
market area.
In January of 2007, we acquired Crest Steel Corporation, a metals
service center company headquartered in Carson, California. Crest was founded in 1963 and has facilities in Riverside, California and Phoenix, Arizona and specializes in the processing and distribution of carbon steel products including flat-rolled, plate, bars and structurals. Crest’s net sales for 2006 were approximately $133 million.
Also in January of 2007, our subsidiary, Siskin Steel & Supply Company, Inc., acquired Industrial Metals and Surplus, Inc., a metals

service center company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and a related company, Athens Steel, Inc. located in Athens, Georgia. Athens is now operating as a division of Industrial Metals. Industrial Metals was founded in 1978 and specializes in the processing and distribution
of carbon steel structurals, flat-rolled and ornamental iron products. Industrial Metals’ net sales for 2006 were approximately $105 million. This acquisition allows us to expand our presence in an important market and to better serve our growing customer base with the addition of Industrial Metals’ larger, more efficient facility. We expect to combine Siskin’s existing Georgia Steel Supply Company operation into Industrial Metals’ facility in 2007.
On February 14, 2007, our Board of Directors declared a 33% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to $.08 per share of common stock. The Company has paid regular quarterly dividends for 47 consecutive years, and has increased its regular dividend 14 times, amounting to over 1,300% since our 1994 IPO.
We are pleased with our position in the metals service center industry and the opportunity to demonstrate our capabilities and show that our strategies are effective and have produced industry-leading growth and operating results on a consistent basis. We are firm believers in the future of our Company and our industry and in our ability to grow profitably through organic growth of our existing businesses and by continued successful acquisitions.
We now have more than 180 service center locations in 37 states and Belgium, Canada, China and South Korea. We are proud of our successful track record. Reliance is a strong, stable and focused company that has a proven business strategy and an excellent reputation in our industry. The Company was named to the Forbes Platinum 400 List
of America’s Best Big Companies for 2007, our seventh year with that distinction. We appreciate your continued support.
