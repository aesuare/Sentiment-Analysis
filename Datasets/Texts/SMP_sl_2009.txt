We believe that 2009 will rank as one of the most successful years in our 91-year old history.
One year ago, we were not nearly so sanguine. $45 million remained from our $90 million 10-year convertible debenture, and it was due to be paid in July. We were in the midst of the biggest financial crisis in the U.S. since the Great Depression, and financial institutions were failing almost on a daily basis. Sources for funds had essentially dried up.
We had no choice but to raise the money internally. And we did, by taking the following actions:
n We sold our Long Island City building. With all the manufacturing moved to other locations, we required only a portion of the building for our home office and we are now renting this space from the new owner.
n We reduced inventory by $30 million, on top of a reduction of $18 million the previous year.
n We entered into factoring relationships with some of our key customers, which reduced our accounts receivable by $50 million.
n We suspended the dividend. We have since re-introduced the dividend at a rate of 5 cents per share per quarter beginning in 2010.
n We implemented a hiring freeze and an early retirement program. As a result, we reduced salaried staff by roughly 100 people, 10% of our total.
n We reduced capital expenditures.
n We instituted a salary freeze for all salaried personnel.
n We exited two small businesses. We sold our share of an engine computer rebuilding joint venture to our partner, and we sold our European distribution business to our local managers. We determined that neither of these were truly core businesses for us.
n In the fourth quarter we sold 3,450,000 shares to the public, which raised $27.5 million of equity, net of expenses.
As a result of these and other actions, we reduced our total debt by $118 million during 2009. When it came time to pay off the remaining bonds in July, we did so with room to spare. Further, we are now in a position to pursue acquisition opportunities should they arise.
It was an outstanding achievement, requiring great effort and personal sacrifice on the part of all our people. We thank and congratulate them all.
The year had other accomplishments as well. We continue to build
up our facilities in Mexico and Poland. We now have over 1,000
employees in these two countries, representing nearly 50% of all our production hours.
We are quite satisfied with the progress we are making, and look forward to additional growth. The cost savings from these factories are enabling us to compete with low priced imports from the Far East, while at the same time helping us improve
our gross margin.
We acquired the assets of Federal Mogul’s wire business, with about $20-25 million in annual volume. We are now manufacturing and shipping these products from our existing wire and cable facilities, and the integration has proceeded smoothly.
Meanwhile, the automotive aftermarket, which represents approximately 93% of our total volume, remains healthy. With new car sales down, people are keeping their cars longer, the average age of the car population continues to grow, and this leads to increased repairs.

    The original equipment business is going through more difficult times, as it is tied to new vehicle production. However, our OE business represents only 7% of our total sales. OE sales were down nearly 50% in 2009, in line with the industry, but it is rebounding slightly this year.
All in all, as we said, we consider 2009 one of the most successful years in our history. We look forward to 2010 and the years ahead.
We thank all our people for their achievements and we thank you for your support.
