Dear Stockholders,
In 2013 Primerica successfully executed initiatives to grow distribution in order to drive long-term organic earnings. Our continued building of the Term Life business and positive Investment and Savings Products performance coupled with share and warrant repurchases drove expansion of operating earnings per share and return on adjusted equity, underscoring the strength of our franchise.

Distribution Highlights
Primerica's life insurance licensed sales force increased to 95,566, the largest sales force we have had in over three years. Sales force growth was achieved with continued improvement in the ratio of new recruits obtaining a life insurance license as well as improvement in the ratio of licensed representatives renewing their life insurance licenses. Our average annualized premium and face amount per issued life insurance policy modestly improved in 2013, offsetting the slight decline in issued policies. Our TermNow rapid-issue term life insurance product accounted for over 60% of policies issued in 2013 and over 90% of those eligible received an underwriting decision within two minutes of application submission. 2013 was a record year for our Investment and Savings Products (ISP) segment. We achieved all-time highs in both ISP sales and client asset values due to expanded product offerings and platform enhancements as well as positive market performance. Products introduced in recent years represented approximately 20% of total ISP sales in 2013. Managed account client asset values grew to $1.1 billion at the end of 2013 from $582 million at the end of 2012. In June, our biennial convention provided the environment and platform to launch new products, incentive programs and technology that enhanced our clients' experience and expanded the business opportunity for our representatives. Approximately 35,000 people from the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico attended our convention where we announced service enhancements for our life insurance clients, a new variable annuity and a proprietary fixed indexed annuity product. Announcements and incentives focused the sales force on growing the number of insurance licensed representatives and building the Investment and Savings Products business. As part of our strategy to adapt with the changing mobile world, we introduced a streamlined, web-based financial needs analysis (FNA) and a new Primerica "app" with functions that include a contact manager, life insurance Quick Quotes and financial calculators.

Performance
One of the key benefits of Primerica's diverse income sources is our capacity to generate and deploy capital to drive stockholder value while maintaining our financial strength. In each full year since our 2010 IPO, we have consistently returned over 100% of operating earnings to stockholders. In 2013, we returned 105% of operating earnings to stockholders through $25.1 million of stockholder dividends and $154.7 million of common stock and warrant repurchases. Quarterly stockholder dividends were increased to $0.11 cents, or $0.44 per share for the full-year 2013, maintaining our 1% dividend yield. Our 2013 repurchase transactions retired all of the warrants and 4% of Primerica's common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2012. Since the IPO, we have retired 29% of Primerica's common stock outstanding. In 2014, we expect to further enhance stockholder value by repurchasing approximately $150 million of our common stock subject to regulatory approval of a redundant reserve financing transaction. We are committed to optimizing Primerica's strong balance sheet and maintaining a conservative, high quality investment portfolio. Our term life business allows for a low ratio of invested assets to adjusted equity because it does not produce liabilities associated with client funds and is therefore less exposed to interest rate risk than most life insurance companies. Primerica Life Insurance Company remains well positioned to fund future growth with a Risk-Based Capital Ratio in excess of 490% at the end of 2013. Our financial strength was confirmed in 2013 when Standard & Poor's, Moody's and A.M. Best Company affirmed their strong ratings of Primerica, Inc. and Primerica Life Insurance Company. Our solid performance was driven by 10% growth in term life net premiums and strong Investment and Savings Products performance compared to 2012. Positive market conditions as well as enhancements to our ISP offerings led to an 11% increase in ISP sales and a 20% increase in client asset values at the end of 2013 versus the end of 2012. Approximately 75% of Primerica's $1.3 billion of operating revenue in 2013 was generated by sales activity prior to 2013. Our large block of in-force term life policies generates stable, recurring income that is not highly sensitive to fluctuations in current sales levels. Our ISP segment also generates significant recurring revenue, although sales and market performance have a greater revenue impact on a short-term basis, as apparent in the 2013 ISP results. Net operating income of $171.0 million declined $3.5 million in 2013 compared with 2012, partially reflecting a year-over-year decline in net investment income related to lower yield on invested assets as well as a lower invested asset base following the repurchase of common stock and warrants. An increase in insurance and operating expenses as well as legal fees and expenses related to a specific litigation matter also impacted net operating income in 2013. While these expenses created downward pressure on 2013 results, active capital deployment drove a 9% increase in net operating earnings per diluted share to $2.97 compared with $2.72 in 2012. Return on adjusted stockholders' equity expanded for the third consecutive year, increasing to 15.0% in 2013 from 14.3% in 2012. In 2013, investors responded favorably to the actions we've taken to drive stockholder value. PRI's total stockholder return of 44.7%, including dividends, significantly outpaced the total return of the S&P 500 in 2013.

Looking Ahead
As we look to the future, Primerica's financial strength and solid business fundamentals represent a compelling investment opportunity. We are working on initiatives and business enhancements focused on supporting our sales force in order to grow distribution and help more middle-income families navigate their financial futures. Middle-income families, which make up approximately 58 million households in the U.S., need us more than ever as other financial institutions compete for affluent and mass affluent households. Industry research indicates that ownership of individual life insurance by American and Canadian households has been declining steadily for decades. With over 95,000 life insurance licensed representatives and 22,000 mutual fund licensed representatives, Primerica is uniquely positioned to fill the financial gaps for these middle-income families. Our distribution capability, coupled with Primerica's consistent, recurring income sources and continued active capital redeployment, will drive meaningful longterm value and enhanced returns for our sales force, clients, employees and stockholders.

Sincerely,

Rick Williams John Addison Chairman of the Board and Chairman of Primerica Distribution and Co-Chief Executive Officer Co-Chief Executive Officer
