Letter to Shareholders

Dear Fellow Shareholder,

I am pleased to report that General Dynamics had a very strong year in 2006. I am particularly encouraged that each of the company's operating groups contributed to this result. Three of them ­ Aerospace, Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology ­ had double-digit growth in both revenue and operating earnings. The fourth, Marine Systems, had modest revenue growth but a strong double-digit increase in operating earnings. Overall, revenues rose to $24.1 billion, a 14.7 percent increase over 2005. Operating earnings grew by over 20 percent to $2.6 billion and operating margins increased 50 basis points to 10.9 percent. Earnings from continuing operations, after tax, increased 18.1 percent, and net income rose 27 percent, aided by non-operating gains. As in the past, our cash performance was strong. Cash from operating activities reached $2.1 billion, mirroring last year's performance. Free cash flow, defined as cash from continuing operations less capital expenditures, was $1.8 billion. Also of note, backlog increased to an all-time high ­ $43.7 billion at year end.

Revenue by Group (In millions)

Let me briefly review our progress in each line of business.
Aerospace

Gulfstream performance was superb in almost all respects. Revenues rose nearly 20 percent to $4.1 billion, and operating earnings grew by 30 percent to $644 million. Operating margins were 15.6 percent compared to 14.4 percent in 2005. Green deliveries rose 27 percent to 113 aircraft. Gulfstream had 159 new aircraft orders, an increase of 35 over the prior year, with significant growth from international markets. Given the strong demand, pricing continued to firm during the year. Since order activity outpaced deliveries, backlog grew and reached a new high of $7.7 billion. Our existing backlog and the current order activity justify 2007 planned production of 139 aircraft, an increase of 23 percent. Looking even further ahead, Gulfstream has a strong product-development plan that will allow us to bring to market highly innovative and reliable products in a timely way. I believe that new products, delivered cost-effectively and predictably, will ensure that Gulfstream remains the market leader in business aviation.

Combat Systems

Combat Systems had another impressive year. Revenues grew over 19 percent to $6 billion, and operating earnings increased 18 percent to $677 million. We experienced continued strong demand for several of our products, including the Stryker wheeled combat vehicle, the M1 Abrams tank and the Light Armored Vehicle. In 2006, we expanded the Stryker program by delivering two new variants in the year, the Mobile Gun System and the Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Reconnaissance vehicle. The U.S. military also increased orders for the company's ammunition, high-performance armaments and repair services in support of our deployed troops. Internationally, Combat Systems received a $600 million order from Belgium for Piranha IIICs, a $1 billion order from the Czech Republic for Pandur IIs, and began production on the 2005 contract with Portugal to build Pandur II armored personnel carriers. As a result of these activities, Combat Systems' backlog rose to $12 billion, representing approximately two years of sales.
Marine Systems

The breadth of the Marine Systems business was evident in our defense work and our expansion in the commercial market. NASSCO delivered to the Navy the first of nine T-AKE combat logistics ships and entered into an agreement with U.S. Shipping Partners, L.P., for the construction of nine productcarrier tankers for approximately $1 billion. In our defense sector, Electric Boat delivered two ships in the Virginia-class submarine program. Bath Iron Works delivered two Arleigh Burke destroyers, and continued work on the first Littoral Combat Ship and the new DDG-1000 destroyer design. Marine Systems' backlog was $14 billion in 2006, a decrease from 2005, but funded backlog rose 12 percent over 2005. The U.S. Navy continues to increase funding for ship construction and we are well positioned to meet their needs for surface combatants, submarines and supply ships. We also believe that the demand for U.S.-built commercial ships is increasing, and here again, we are well positioned to take advantage of market growth.
Information Systems and Technology

five years is in part attributable to a changing product mix. We have managed a transition from several mature production programs to developmental-stage activity. In addition, while government spending to support operations in Iraq and Afghanistan provides additional funds for some of our programs, most notably in Combat Systems, it appears to have drawn funds from other programs, particularly in the Information Systems and Technology group. However, total backlog grew to almost $10 billion on firm order activity. We are well positioned to take full advantage of future growth in the information systems and technology market.
The Future

The future year defense plan submitted by the administration with the fiscal year 2008 budget continues to provide robust funding for defense, including the investment accounts. While these plans are subject to change, we see nothing in the environment at home or abroad that would suggest a material change in this funding profile during our planning horizon.
Capital Deployment

For the first time in several years, I can report that Marine Systems' performance improved markedly. Revenue was almost $5 billion, up 5 percent from 2005, and operating earnings increased over 50 percent. Operating margins rose a full 230 basis points to 7.6 percent, driven by significant performance improvements at the NAASCO shipyard, in the submarine repair and overhaul business, and in labor-hour efficiencies in the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyer program. This resulted in an encouraging turn around and left Marine Systems positioned for further improvement.

Information Systems and Technology revenues rose to $9 billion, and operating earnings increased to $976 million. The increase over 2005 of 15 percent and 13 percent, respectively, was primarily the result of acquisitions rather than organic growth. In 2006, General Dynamics acquired Anteon International Corporation and FC Business Systems to expand our infrastructure and information technology services businesses. This has allowed us to offer end-to-end capability and services for information technology programs throughout the federal government. The absence of significant organic growth in what has been our fastest growing sector over the past

We are in an era of robust defense spending. For fiscal year 2007, the Congress appropriated $435 billion for the Department of Defense, including $156 billion for procurement and research and development (R&D) activities. Procurement and R&D budgets, also known as investment accounts, provide the majority of the company's revenues. For fiscal year 2008, the President has requested $481 billion for the Department of Defense, an 11 percent increase over the 2007 funding. This includes $177 billion for investment accounts, an increase of 13.4 percent over 2007. During this wartime era, defense appropriations have included the President's annual defense budget submission as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to support the war. For fiscal year 2007, the administration requested, and the Congress appropriated, approximately $70 billion in supplemental funding. Congress has been asked to provide $93 billion more, which, if approved, will bring total defense funding for fiscal year 2007 to over $600 billion. Approximately 28 percent, or $45 billion, of the 2007 supplemental funding request is anticipated for additional procurement funding.

In 2006, we remained attentive to growing the value of our company. We spent $2.6 billion on four acquisitions ­ FC Business Systems, Inc., Anteon International Corporation, the Scranton division of Chamberlain Manufacturing Corporation and SNC Technologies Inc., which closed in January 2007. Also in 2006, we paid $359 million in dividends. In addition, in March 2007, the board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share, an increase of 26 percent.
In Closing

The efficient and profitable use of capital remains as important to your management team today as it has over the past 10 years. We will continue to employ the basic principles that have led to where we are today: a focus on earnings, free cash generation and disciplined deployment of capital to build value for our shareholders.

Sincerely,

Nicholas D. Chabraja Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
