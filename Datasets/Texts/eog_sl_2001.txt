EO G has a passion for clean, simple, conservative financials.
  EOG has partially hedged 2002 natural gas prices and is re-emphasizing operational cost efficiencies while targeting flat North American production growth.
EOG’s debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 34 percent is well below our peer group average of approximately 50 percent. During 2001, EOG was one of
the few companies in its peer group to reduce its debt-to-total capitalization ratio. We are well positioned with our low debt level and recognize there may be opportunities to utilize
some of our balance sheet strength for appropriate acquisitions.
EOG spent $1.1 billion on capital expenditures in 2001, including approximately $170 million of acquisitions. For 2002, our capital expenditure budget of $600 to $750 million excludes acquisitions and factors in lower drilling costs, as well as a sharply focused exploration program. This should prove very productive. We expect 2002 capital expenditures to slightly exceed cash flow and debt may be allowed to increase modestly to allow for smaller acquisitions.

EOG also continues to emphasize the importance of per-share metrics. We are the only independent exploration and production company among our peer group to reduce its number of shares outstanding for five

to be our greatest strength. Working together, we think they distinguish EO G from our peer group. EO G still very much favors the decentralized organizational structure in which we operate. Regionally focused, it is bottom line oriented and operationally autonomous, keeping EOG employees closer to the action. This gives us a competitive edge.
So what really matters at EOG?
We value honesty and integrity. We have a passion for clean, simple, conservative financials. We shy away from complex financial structures whether they are debt merger related. We have no off- balance sheet special purpose vehicles and carry zero goodwill our balance sheet. We think it is important to focus on cost efficiencies and rate of return on
capital. Our game plan to grow EOG through the drillbit is simple and easy to understand. We think that is why EOG has achieved superior stock price performance over the last two years.
Our commitment to our shareholders in 2002 and beyond stands: EOG is committed to consistently delivering the highest shareholder appreciation of any independent exploration and production company in the United States.
In closing, we dedicate the 2001 EOG Resources, Inc. Annual Report to Shareholders in memory of Fred C. Ackman. Mr. Ackman, who served on our board of directors since the very beginning of EOG, passed away in 2001. We will miss Fred’s wisdom, judgment and dedication.

             consecutive years. In 2001, EOG repurchased 1.5 million shares, reducing basic shares outstanding to 115.1 million at December 31, 2001. We elected again not to participate in large acquisitions and mergers at the top of the market that would have required us to issue additional stock or greatly increase our debt.
As always, we consider our workforce of 960 men and women
