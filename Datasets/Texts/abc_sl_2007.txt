Our associates delivered strong performance in our fiscal year ended September 30, 2007 as AmerisourceBergen continued to successfully execute on its strategy of focusing solely on the pharmaceutical supply channel. Operating revenue increased 9% to a record $62 billion and operating income in our Pharmaceutical Distribution Segment increased 14%. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the year were $2.63, up 16%. Our compounded growth in EPS from continuing operations is over 16% for the last six years. We generated $1.2 billion in cash flows from operations for the fiscal year. Our balance sheet continues to be strong and we have excellent financial flexibility.
Our business continues to be solidly anchored in pharmaceutical distribution with the ability to provide value-added services up and down the pharmaceutical supply channel. Our AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC) had an exceptional year. FY07 was the first year ABDC enjoyed the full benefits of our five-year integration plan as well as the transition to
a fee-for-service model with our branded pharmaceutical suppliers.
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG) grew revenues 23% for the year as its strong position in the distribution of specialty pharmaceuticals and provision of related services, primarily to physicians, continued to drive growth well above the pharmaceutical market.
With a record number of contract packaging wins in fiscal 2007, our AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group continued its solid performance in the year. The pipeline in contract packaging remains strong, as manufacturers continue to outsource this capability. Our workers’ compensation business, PMSI, continued to be challenged in the year and is in the midst of a turnaround effort.
On July 31, 2007, we spun off our PharMerica Long-Term Care business to you, our shareholders, combining it with another institutional pharmacy to create a new public company, PharMerica Corporation (NYSE: PMC), with revenues approaching $2 billion. We think PMC has an excellent future.
We used our strong cash position to repurchase $1.4 billion of our stock during the fiscal year and used approximately $170 million in the fiscal year to acquire companies enhancing our value added services. In October 2007, we purchased Bellco Health for $181 million. With about $2 billion in annual revenue, Bellco is a premier pharmaceutical distributor in the Metro New York City area, with national distribution programs to dialysis clinics as well as a generic telemarketing operation in Florida. Bellco is a great addition to ABDC.
As I look ahead, I continue to see a bright future for AmerisourceBergen. Our associates, who work every day meeting the needs of our customers, knowing that people’s lives and health depend on what they do, continue to execute their jobs with creativity and enthusiasm. It is a privilege for me to work with them on your behalf.
The pharmaceutical market continues its strong growth and our position in the industry remains robust. We have the best customer base in the industry to capitalize on our two growth drivers: generic pharmaceuticals and specialty pharmaceuticals.
Thank you for your continued support and interest in AmerisourceBergen.
