TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
ANOTHER YEAR OF RECORD SALES & EARNINGS FOR GENUINE PARTS COMPANY
 We are pleased to report that 2014 was another year of record sales and earnings for Genuine Parts Company. Total Company sales were $15.3 billion, a 9% increase compared to 2013. Reported net earnings were up 4%
to $711 million and earnings per share were up 5% to $4.61, compared to 2013. Before the one-time positive adjustment in 2013 related to the acquisition of GPC
Asia Pacific, net income was up 9% and earnings per share were up 10%, compared to 2013. The GPC Team showed progress across all four of our business segments in 2014. Our automotive operations produced another year of consistent and steady sales growth, and our non-automotive businesses rebounded nicely in 2014 after experiencing difficult market conditions in the prior year. We are also pleased to report a solid increase in
the total value of the Company again in 2014. Our stock price increased 28% for the year and, combined with our dividend, provided our shareholders with a total return of 31% in 2014. Over the past 10 years, our total return to shareholders stands at 13%.

  FINANCIAL STRENGTH
Genuine Parts Company further improved its financial strength in 2014
with a continued emphasis on growing earnings and effectively managing the balance sheet. Our ongoing asset management and working capital initiatives helped us to maintain a strong cash position, with cash of $138 million at December 31, 2014. For the year, cash from operations totaled approximately $790 million and, after dividends paid of $347 million and capital expenditures of $108 million, our free cash flow was approximately $335 million. At December 31, 2014, our total debt was $765 million, which represents a modest 19% of total capitalization.
ACQUISITIONS
During 2014, we acquired several new businesses which positively impacted our overall results for the year. We added three businesses in early 2014, with one each in the Industrial, Electrical and Office Products groups. Additionally, the Company’s Asia Pacific automotive operations acquired RDA Brakes and PJL Diesel Electric in April and September, 2014, respectively. RDA is a leader in the Australian brake rotor market and PJL specializes in the distribution of automotive electrical products.
The Company’s Office Products Group made its second acquisition of the year in July 2014, with the purchase of Impact Products, a leading value- added provider of facility, janitorial and safety supplies. Finally, our Electrical/ Electronic Group made a second acquisition in August 2014, acquiring IWI, an electrical distribution company.
The Company has continued to add to its operations with two more acquisitions thus far in 2015. Effective January 2, 2015, the Office Products Group acquired JAL Associates, a regional office furniture wholesaler. Effective February 1, 2015, the Industrial Parts Group acquired Miller Bearings, a leading independent distributor of industrial MRO products with 17 locations in the state of Florida.
OPERATIONS
The Company’s revenue growth in 2014 was driven by solid sales results in all four of our business segments. Industry fundamentals were favorable in the automotive aftermarket, and we experienced improving industry conditions across our non-automotive businesses. These factors, combined with
our internal sales initiatives, partially drove our sales increase for the year. Acquisitions were another important factor, contributing approximately 5% to 2014 sales.
The Automotive Group, our largest segment at 53% of 2014 revenues, reported an 8% sales increase for the year. Our core sales were up 6%, while the 2013 acquisition of the Australasian business and two small automotive
acquisitions in 2014 contributed 4% to sales. The impact of currency primarily related to our Australasian and Canadian business negatively impacted our revenues by approximately 2%. Both our commercial and retail business segments grew nicely in 2014. We feel the solid results in NAPA AutoCare and Major Accounts, our two primary commercial initiatives, had the greatest impact on our overall sales growth. Turning to 2015, we continue to view the fundamentals supporting demand in the automotive aftermarket as favorable and combined with our internal growth initiatives, we are optimistic for another year of solid growth for the Automotive Group.
Motion Industries, our industrial distribution company, represents 31% of our 2014 revenues. Sales for Motion in 2014 were up 8% overall and up 6% before a 3% contribution from acquisitions and a 1% headwind from currency. The manufacturing indices we follow in this segment grew steadily in 2014 and we experienced strengthening demand patterns among our customer base, as evidenced by the sequential improvement in Motion’s core sales growth in each quarter of 2014. We move forward into 2015 with continued confidence in the growth prospects for this business. Staying within the manufacturing segment of the economy, EIS, our electrical/ electronic distribution company, represents 5% of our 2014 revenues.
This group showed a 30% sales increase for the year, driven primarily by acquisitions. Looking ahead, we expect a gradually improving customer climate to support stronger underlying sales growth at EIS in 2015.
S. P. Richards, our Office Products Group, represents 11% of our 2014 revenues and had a 10% sales increase for the year. This is the strongest sales growth for the Office business in many years and is evenly split between contributions from core sales and acquisitions. New business with a key customer partially accounts for the core sales growth, although our initiatives to diversify the SPR business have also positively impacted sales. In 2015, the Office Group will continue to focus on its growth initiatives, including
the ongoing diversification of product and customer portfolios, market share gains and acquisitions.
SHARE REPURCHASES
We repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our Company stock
in 2014, and we continue to view this as a good use of our cash. As of December 31, 2014, we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional 9.5 million shares, and we expect to continue making opportunistic share repurchases during 2015. Through the combination of share repurchases and dividends, we returned more than $440 million to our shareholders in 2014.

DIVIDENDS & SHAREHOLDER RETURN
   The Company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since going public in 1948, and on February 16, 2015 the Board of Directors raised the cash dividend payable April 1, 2015 to an annual rate of $2.46 per share, up 7% from $2.30 in 2014.

 GPC DIRECTORS
In April of 2015, Dr. Michael M.E. Johns and George C. “Jack” Guynn will retire from our Board of Directors. Dr. Johns is the Chancellor and Executive Vice President of Health Affairs Emeritus at Emory University and has served as a Director of our Company since 2000. Mr. Guynn is the retired President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and has served on our Board since 2006. We want to thank both of them for their dedicated service and excellent counsel over the years. They will be missed, and we extend our sincerest gratitude and appreciation.
At our August 2014 Board meeting, E. Jenner Wood, III was elected by the Board as a new Director of the Company. Accordingly, at the April 27, 2015 Shareholders’ Meeting, we are asking the shareholders to elect Mr. Wood as a Director of the Company. Mr. Wood is the Executive Vice President
of SunTrust Banks, Inc., a position he has held since 2005, and was also named Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of SunTrust’s Atlanta Division in April 2014. Mr. Wood has 39 years of experience in banking
and investment management and he brings with him a wealth of business experience and knowledge. He is sure to be a valuable member of our Board and we are fortunate to have him serve with us.
MANAGEMENT
Over the last year, there were a number of key management changes and promotions that we would like to share with you. First, we want to recognize William J. Stevens, who announced in November that he will retire as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Motion Industries effective
March 1, 2015. Mr. Stevens served Motion for 37 years, including the last
18 years as CEO, and we would add that Motion Industries is one of the leading industrial distribution companies in North America, largely attributable to his leadership. We wish Bill the very best in the years ahead. Upon Bill’s announcement to retire, the Company’s Board of Directors elected Timothy
P. Breen to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of Motion Industries. Mr. Breen was previously President and Chief Operating Officer at Motion Industries and his proven leadership and tremendous industry experience make him the right person to lead Motion to further success in
the years ahead.
Additionally, Larry L. Griffin was elected President of EIS effective January
2, 2015. Mr. Griffin has over 31 years of sales and management experience as both a supplier and distributor, including his most recent roles as Senior Vice President of Marketing and Senior Vice President of the Fabrication and Coating business at EIS. We are pleased to have Mr. Griffin in his new and expanded role.
We also want to advise you that at our April 2014 Board meeting, the Directors elected Kirk J. Allan to Vice President of Human Resources Operations and Compliance, Thomas E. Dunmon to Vice President of Corporate Reporting and Analysis and Vickie S. Smith to Vice President Employee Relations. At our February 2015 Board meeting, the Directors elected Robert A. Milstead, who joined the Company in January 2015, to Senior Vice President Digital, Thomas K. Davis to Vice President Supplier Business IT and Jennifer L. Ellis to Corporate Secretary and Associate Counsel. Each of these individuals is very talented and well deserving of their new positions. We look forward to their many future contributions.
CONCLUSION
The Company showed continued progress in a number of key areas in 2014 and we are proud of the GPC Team’s accomplishments. 2014 was another year of record sales and earnings, and we are especially pleased that each of our four business segments contributed to these records. We also improved our operating margin for the year and further improved our financial strength with effective asset management and solid cash flows.
We recognize there is still room for further improvement in our operations as we move forward. To this end, we remain committed to our core objectives of growing sales and earnings, showing continued operating margin improvement, generating solid cash flows and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Progress in each of these important areas will keep the Company moving ahead and will help to ensure another successful year in 2015.
We want to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to our employees, customers, vendors and shareholders for their commitment to and ongoing support of Genuine Parts Company.
