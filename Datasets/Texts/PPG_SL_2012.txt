Letter from the Chairman
In 2012, PPG Industries achieved record results and took several significant strategic actions that accelerated the pace of our business portfolio transformation. First, PPG achieved new adjusted earnings-per-share records in each quarter and delivered higher full-year adjusted earnings in each major region, reflecting our strong operating execution. Full-year 2012 adjusted net income was $1.2 billion, or $7.94 per diluted share, up $1.07, or 16 percent, versus the prior-year record. We continued our history of strong cash generation, delivering record full-year cash from operations, up nearly 25 percent versus the prior year, and ended the year with $2.4 billion of cash and shortterm investments. Sales for the year increased to $15.2 billion, up 2 percent compared to 2011, despite moderate overall economic conditions that varied by region and end-use market. Second, we made continued progress in transforming PPG's business portfolio, including the following key achievements: to aggressively manage our businesses and costs, and we will maintain a focus on opportunities for margin improvement and profitable growth. Effective execution of our strategies will be key to our 2013 growth objectives. This will include closing the AkzoNobel North American architectural coatings transaction and successfully integrating this business, efficiently managing our more focused business portfolio, and maintaining our disciplined approach to cost control and operational excellence. We will also continue to analyze prudent cash-deployment opportunities for our strong cash position, with an emphasis on profitable earnings-growth initiatives. As always, PPG remains committed to and focused on safety, environmental performance, compliance and ethics. And we will continue to expand our community and social initiatives around the globe in the communities where we operate. For more about this work, please see our 2012 Sustainability Report, which will be available in April. In summary, PPG has successfully transformed itself during the past decade from being a diversified, multibusiness manufacturer to a focused coatings and specialty products company. We expect 2013 to be another milestone year in this transformation, and I remain confident that our strategy and execution will lead to continued success and future value for our shareholders.

PPG's strong earnings performance and strategic progress were rewarded with a record stock price. The year-end stock price increased more than 60 percent versus the prior year-end. We also raised the annual dividend payout to shareholders for the 41st consecutive year ­ a legacy we are proud to continue. Clearly, 2012 was a milestone year for PPG and positions us for future growth. Looking at the global economies, we expect trends will remain varied by region in 2013, with growth continuing in North America, modestly improving growth prospects in Asia, and inconsistent activity levels in Europe. As a result, we will continue
