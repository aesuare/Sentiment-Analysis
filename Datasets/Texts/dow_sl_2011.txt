Dear Stockholders,
In 2011, Dow’s transformation continued as we reached new levels of profitability and further positioned your Company for long-term, sustainable growth.
• We delivered double-digit gains in revenue and earnings per share during the year, and posted record revenues at a Company level, as well as in emerging geographies.
• Welaunchedgame-changinginvestmentsandpartnerships that will allow us to bring our solutions to strategic sectors, positioning us to capture more demand in the world’s fastest-growing regions – all from back-integrated, cost-advantaged positions.
• We commercialized new solutions that anticipate and address the needs of our customers, while solving challenges in energy, agriculture, transportation and infrastructure, as well as the needs of a growing consumer society. Our R&D pipeline is stronger than ever before, and more importantly, our innovations are delivering real value to the bottom line – today.
• Finally, we retired $4.8 billion of debt in 2011, generated nearly $4 billion of cash from operating activities, and brought our net debt to total capitalization ratio to 40.8 percent – ahead of our projected path to delivering our 2012 net debt goal.
We delivered these results in the midst of an often unpredictable economic environment, which is validation of the resilience of our Company. In this time of great change, Dow sees enormous opportunity to combine our world-class science expertise, global understanding and unmatched creativity to deliver real solutions to the world, and real value to our stockholders.
As a result, Dow is not the same company you knew just two short years ago.
• Our innovation pipeline is unsurpassed. We have delivered $400 million of EBITDA1 from innovation since 2009, and we expect to reach $2 billion by 2015.
• Our formidable feedstock advantage provides us with a solid foundation for the next many decades, as we are the world’s largest ethylene producer. In fact, we are bolstering our industry-leading integration strength – moving quickly and taking significant actions to fully realize the benefit of shale gas fundamentals in the United States ... driving down costs and enabling higher and more consistent margins.
• Our vast geographic reach and our diversified portfolio are further strengthened through strategic joint ventures such as Sadara, our landmark project with Saudi Aramco, which will drive profitability in rapidly growing regions of the world.
• And finally, we have strengthened our balance sheet and continue to drive efficiencies throughout the Company, which gives us even greater flexibility to execute on our strategy.
