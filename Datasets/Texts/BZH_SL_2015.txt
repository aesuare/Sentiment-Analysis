                                To Our Shareholders
After we returned to profitability during our previous fiscal year, Fiscal 2015 represented a meaningful step forward in achieving our previously communicated “2B-10” goals. These goals translate into generating at least $200 million in Adjusted EBITDA by growing revenue to $2 billion and our Adjusted EBITDA margin to10 percent. In 2015, we generated both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth through a combination of a larger community count, additional home sales and closings and an increase in our average sales price. These improvements led to higher earnings per share in Fiscal 2015 and, importantly, the release of a substantial portion of our valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, which boosted our book value per share by more than $10.00. As we entered Fiscal 2016, we established a new objective alongside our 2B-10 Plan: to complement our growth ambitions with steps to reduce our leverage over the next couple of years. Taken together, these plans will allow us to grow while improving the health of our balance sheet.
The 2B-10 Plan
In November 2013, we outlined a set of interim objectives: to reach $2 billion in revenue with a 10 percent Adjusted EBITDA margin. We named this our 2B-10 Plan. As we outlined at that time, reaching 2B-10 would require improvements in five key metrics: sales per community per month, average sales price, community count, homebuilding gross margins and cost leverage (i.e., reducing the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to total revenue).
We have consistently noted that there are a number of potential paths to achieving the underlying goal of generating $200 million of Adjusted EBITDA specified by our 2B-10 Plan. To help demonstrate these paths, we introduced targeted ranges for each of our key metrics in November 2015:
     Revenue
Margins
Sales/Community/Month Average Sales Price (“ASP”) Average Community Count
HB Gross Margin % SG&A (% of Revenue)
2B-10 Plan Ranges
2.8 – 3.2 $330K – $340K 170 – 175
21% – 22% 11% – 12%
We are pleased with the progress we have made so far:
Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA Growth – When we introduced our 2B-10 Plan, we had just reported our Fiscal 2013 results. At that time, we had a gap of $712 million to reach $2 billion in revenue and 3.3 points in EBITDA margin to reach 10 percent. In dollar terms, we had a gap of about $114 million of Adjusted EBITDA*.
Over the last two years, we’ve made substantial strides to narrow that gap. Total revenue in Fiscal 2015 was $1.6 billion, up $164 million versus the prior year. With closings relatively flat, we benefited from a significant increase in our average sales price, driven primarily by the geographic mix of our deliveries and some market-related improvements in home prices.

In spite of a challenging cost environment in some of our markets, reflecting tighter labor supply and higher land costs, we successfully managed our overhead spending, resulting in improved overall profitability. Our Adjusted EBITDA* rose 8.1 percent versus the prior year to $144 million. Our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 8.9 percent, as we continue to work toward our 2B-10 goal of 10 percent.
Sales Per Community Per Month – During Fiscal 2015, our rate of sales per community per month was 2.8, which was comparable to the prior fiscal year and remains among the top in the industry. Maintaining our position as an industry leader in sales pace remains a top strategic priority.
Community Count – We ended Fiscal 2015 with 166 communities, 7.1 percent higher than the end of Fiscal 2014, as the benefit from our increased land spending in prior years continued to materialize. As a result of these investments, we are targeting a community count between 170 and 175 as part of our 2B-10 Plan.
Average Sales Price – While we have been buying land in nearly all of our markets over the past few years, incremental investments have been focused on securing attractive parcels in locations that feature some of the strongest employment opportunities and school districts in the country, as well as some of our higher-priced geographic markets. This mix shift, combined with some market pricing power, has led to a significant rise in our average sales price from $284.8 thousand last year to $313.5 thousand this year. In addition, we ended Fiscal 2015 with an average sales price for our units in backlog of $327.6 thousand, indicating that prices of our closings should continue to increase.
Homebuilding Gross Margin – During Fiscal 2015, we delivered homebuilding gross margins** that were 70 basis points below the previous year. Our homebuilding gross margin declined due to an increase in the cost of land, reflecting both market conditions and the structure of our land deals. In addition, our profitability has been impacted by higher labor costs as well as changes in the geographic mix of our closings. We continue to pursue opportunities to drive higher gross margins through operational improvements aimed at increasing efficiency, while recognizing that our 2B-10 Plan objective is tied to improvements in our EBITDA margins.
Leverage Fixed Costs – Finally, our SG&A expenses were 12.8 percent of total revenue for Fiscal 2015, compared with 13.3 percent a year earlier, demonstrating our ability to generate top-line growth from our fixed cost base. We expect further increases in operating leverage in the coming years as our revenue continues to increase from both higher average sales price and an increased closing pace from some of our newer communities.

Reducing Financial Leverage with a Balanced Growth Approach
With our land position already in place to meet our 2B-10 objectives, we’ve adopted
a complementary plan to reduce financial leverage in the coming years as we look to lower our cash interest expense and our ratio of debt to EBITDA. To generate the increased liquidity to fund our debt reduction, we’re focusing on increasing the efficiency of our capital base. This will take different forms in the coming years, including the activation of some of our lots currently classified as Land Held for Future Development and relying more on third-party land bankers, who provide land acquisition and development financing to homebuilders, to fund incremental growth opportunities.
While we continue to expect the housing recovery to proceed on a slow and steady pace for a number of years, we are convinced that deleveraging while the market is improving will create value for our shareholders.
The Beazer Difference
We are constantly updating and improving the homes we offer. In fact, we believe that buying a Beazer home provides the best new home value of any offering in the industry. Specifically, we emphasize three key pillars of differentiation to our customers:
Mortgage Choice – We attempt to create a less stressful mortgage application process for our customers by selecting a preferred set of lenders based on quality customer service, available loan programs and competitive rates. These lenders then compete to earn our customers’ business, which allows each buyer to select the right mortgage and lender for his or her purchase.
Choice PlansTM – With “Beazer Choice Plans,” we have created alternative floor plan options for every plan we offer. These Choice Plans allow buyers to configure their primary living areas to match their preferences and requirements at no additional charge.
Energy Efficiency – Beazer was an early leader in energy and water conservation and we continue to build highly efficient homes. Every Beazer home is ENERGY STAR® certified and rated by a third party, enabling our homeowners to save up to 30 percent on monthly energy use.
Conclusion
We want to thank you for your continued support as the U.S. housing industry recovers from one of the deepest and longest downturns ever faced. We were pleased to deliver profitable results for Fiscal 2015 and are confident that the steps we took to improve our operations and bring the company back to profitability have created
a foundation for further growth and additional profitability in the years ahead. Sincerely,
Stephen P. Zelnak, Jr. Allan P. Merrill
