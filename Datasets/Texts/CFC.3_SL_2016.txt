Directors' remuneration report
Annual statement Dear shareholder On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present our directors' remuneration report for the year ended 31 December 2016.
Policy review
At the 2014 AGM we obtained shareholder approval for our existing directors' remuneration policy. Mindful of the fact that the policy will expire in 2017, the Remuneration Committee has conducted a full review of our current approach to senior executive remuneration. This review was conducted in the context of the macroeconomic environment and the specific developments in our sector. Countrywide is responding to changing customer behaviour and expectations as well as embracing digital capability within its service offerings. Our belief, being increasingly evidenced through piloting new digital developments, is that an integrated multichannel approach will offer customers the best choice. Transforming the business, systems, cost base and culture to achieve this will take several years to fully deliver. We are making good progress, with such progress and associated investment being maintained notwithstanding the increasingly challenged macroeconomic environment that unfolded throughout 2016. The market, in terms of transactional volumes, was tough in 2016 (lower volumes than in 2015) and is likely to continue to be so in 2017. We are in the process of responding to multiple external headwinds ­ changes in stamp duty, the EU referendum, the announcement to ban tenant fees in the rental market, etc. Therefore, the focus of our review has been to support the strategic change agenda whilst responding tactically to each external development. As a result, we are disappointed that the harsh environment impacts our short term profitability but are confident that we are refashioning the business for sustained market leadership. It is in this context that the Committee has decided that continuity in the underlying structure of our remuneration policy is appropriate, with some broadening of the performance measures used in our bonus plan and LTIP to align further with our strategic priorities and to reflect the increasing trend in the market to adopt a richer mix of performance drivers in assessing overall performance and associated remuneration. We have also used this review as an opportunity to update our share ownership guidelines which will result in an increased requirement relative to current policy. Therefore, in the round, the new policy for which we are seeking shareholder approval at the AGM does not fundamentally differ from the existing policy. Consequently, no changes are proposed to be made to the underlying structure of Alison Platt and Jim Clarke's remuneration (our CEO and CFO respectively), which will remain as follows:

2016 performance and reward
During 2016, against challenging market conditions, Group adjusted EBITDA of £83.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2016 was 26% below the £113.0 million achieved in 2015. The Committee acknowledged and supports the strategic transformation being led by management but was disappointed with the absolute level of profitability. This outcome, coupled with our commitment to pay for performance, led to significant negative remuneration outcomes for the 2016 financial performance:

· no more than 30% of bonus continues to be allocated to non· to guard against inappropriate payouts, no portion of the
nonEBITDA elements of the bonus will be payable unless the Committee is satisfied that Countrywide's underlying performance warrants such payouts.

LTIP:

· annual bonus: no bonuses were payable to the executive directors
for 2016; and

· the majority of awards remain subject to EPS and relative
TSR measures;

· LTIP: there will be no vesting of 2014 LTIP awards for Alison Platt

· again, a broader range of metrics will provide a more rounded

assessment of overall long term performance, with the strategic element allowing the Committee to set long term targets that are directly related to delivery against objectively measurable key strategic priorities which will drive the generation of sustainable long term returns to shareholders; directors' awards for 2017 onwards will reflect the policy change made in 2016 for below Board LTIP awards, where a portion of awards made to these participants were made subject to the achievement of three-year strategic objectives (in addition to EPS/TSR), thereby providing alignment across the senior executive population and providing a sharper focus on the critical requirements to deliver the strategic plan; and no vesting of the strategic element will be allowed unless the Committee considers that Countrywide's underlying performance over the vesting period warrants such vesting.

Directors' remuneration report continued
PART A: remuneration policy report
Introduction
This report contains the material required to be set out in the directors' remuneration report for the purposes of Part 4 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013, which amended The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (`the Regulations'). Part A of this report represents the directors' remuneration policy. Part B constitutes the implementation sections of the report (`Annual Report on Remuneration'). The auditor has reported on certain sections of Part B and stated whether, in its opinion, those parts have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006. Those sections of Part B which have been subject to audit are clearly indicated. directors. When setting the policy for remuneration for the executive directors the Committee takes into account the overall approach to reward for employees in the Group, including consideration of salary increases for the general employee population (disclosed in the annual report each year); overall spend on annual bonus; Group-wide benefit offerings; and any other relevant factors as determined by the Committee. Although the Company has not carried out a formal employee consultation regarding Board remuneration (policy or implementation), in accordance with prevailing commercial practice, it does take due account of regulations and practices regarding employee consultation more broadly (with the Committee keeping abreast of developments in this area). The Group people director ensures that the Committee is made aware of any relevant employee feedback regarding the Company's remuneration policy. The Committee is mindful of the requests from, amongst others, the Investment Association, for companies to publish ratios comparing CEO to employee pay. The Company has prepared this analysis internally and it has been reviewed and considered by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee has not, however, published this data in this report as it is concerned that no common methodology has yet been established amongst UK companies and their investors for these comparisons; the Company's expectation is that it will publish ratios showing comparisons in future years when, as can be expected, UK regulations or guidance develop a common methodology. Further information about our engagement with employees across the Group is provided on page 36 of the annual report.

PART A: DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION POLICY
The remuneration policy as set out in this section of the remuneration report will take effect for all payments made to Directors from the date of the AGM to be held on 27 April 2017. The policy has been developed with regard to the UK Corporate Governance Code and is felt to be appropriate to support the long term success of the Company while ensuring that it does not promote inappropriate risk-taking.

Remuneration strategy
Our remuneration strategy is underpinned by remuneration packages that are designed to motivate high performing people to deliver our strategy. These packages:

· are transparent and aligned with the interests of our shareholders; · are weighted to incentivise performance over the short and long term; · are structured to ensure higher rewards are only achieved for
exceptional performance against challenging targets; and

Statement of consideration of shareholder views
The Company welcomes dialogue with its significant shareholders and, in the event that material changes to the policy are proposed, will consult with major shareholders and representative bodies in advance of changes being made (as has been the case in connection with the proposed new policy).

· encourage management to adopt a level of risk commensurate
with the risk profile of the business as approved by the Board.

Statement of employment conditions elsewhere in the Company
The remuneration policy described within this report provides an overview of the structure that operates for the most senior executives in the Group. The remuneration policy for the executive directors is more heavily weighted towards variable pay than for other employees to make a greater part of their pay conditional on the successful delivery of the business strategy. This aims to create a clear link between the value created for shareholders and the remuneration received by the executive

Summary remuneration policy
The table below summarises the Committee's future policy on the remuneration of executive directors which, if approved by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM on 27 April 2017, will replace the existing policy for which shareholder approval was obtained at the 2014 AGM and will become binding immediately thereafter. The material differences between the existing and proposed new policy (which has also been designed with due account taken of the UK Corporate Governance Code) are explained in the Committee chairman's letter and in the table below. It is currently intended that the policy will remain valid until the 2020 AGM.

Notes to summary policy table
1 A description of how the Company intends to implement the remuneration policy for 2017 is set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration. 2 The performance-related elements of remuneration take into account the Group's risk policies and systems, and are designed to align the senior executives' interests with those of shareholders. The Committee reviews and sets the metrics and targets applying to awards to the executives every year, in order to ensure that they are aligned with the Group's strategy. All financial targets will (where appropriate) be set on a sliding scale. Non-financial targets are set based on individual and management team responsibilities and strategic objectives. A summary of the targets to be used in 2017 under the annual bonus and LTIP can be found on page 60. Appropriate levels of reward are available for achieving threshold performance with maximum rewards requiring substantial out-performance of challenging strategic plans. The Committee retains discretion to set different targets and introduce additional metrics in line with the Company's strategy for future awards providing that, in the opinion of the Committee, the new targets are no less challenging in light of the prevailing circumstances than those set previously. If substantially different targets to those used previously are proposed, major shareholders will be consulted. Furthermore, the Committee reserves the right to adjust any bonus outturn and/or LTIP vesting that is based on a formulaic assessment of performance against the targets if such outturn/vesting does not reflect shareholders' experience and/or underlying performance. 3 The Committee operates incentive arrangements for executive directors in accordance with their respective rules and the Listing Rules and HMRC rules where relevant. The Committee, consistent with market practice, retains discretion over a number of areas relating to the operation and administration of the plan rules. These include (but are not limited to) the following: 4 For the avoidance of doubt, in approving this directors' remuneration policy, authority is given to the Company to honour any commitments entered into with current or former directors (such as the payment of a pension or the vesting or exercise of past share awards). 5 The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation, without obtaining shareholder approval for that amendment. 6 The regulations and related investor guidance encourage companies to disclose a cap within which each element of the policy will operate. Where maximum amounts for elements of remuneration have been set within the policy, these will operate simply as caps and are not indicative of any aspiration. 7 While the Committee does not consider it to form part of benefits in the normal usage of that term, it has been advised that corporate hospitality, whether paid for by the Company or another, and business travel for Directors and in exceptional circumstances their families may technically come within the applicable rules and so the Committee expressly reserves the right for the Committee to authorise such activities within its agreed policies. 8 While the appropriate benchmarks vary by role, the Company seeks to apply the philosophy behind this policy across the Company as a whole. Where the Group's pay policy for Directors differs from its pay policies for groups of staff, this reflects the appropriate market rate position and/or typical practice for the relevant roles. The Company takes into account pay levels, bonus opportunity and share awards applied across the Group as a whole when setting the executive directors' policy.

· who participates; · the timing of grant of award and/or payment; · the size of an award (up to plan/policy limits) and/or a payment; · the result indicated by the performance conditions; · discretion relating to the measurement of performance in the event

· determination of a good leaver (in addition to any specified categories) · adjustments required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues,

· the ability to adjust existing performance conditions for exceptional
events so that they can still fulfil their original purpose.

Recruitment of executive directors and promotions
When setting the remuneration package for a new executive director, the Committee will apply the same principles and implement the policy as set out in the table on pages 55 to 57. Base salary will be set at a level appropriate to the role and experience of the director being appointed. This may include setting a below market salary with an agreement on future increases (subject to performance) up to market rate, in line with increased experience and/or responsibilities. Our policy on maximum annual bonus and LTIP awards would apply. In relation to external appointments, the Committee may structure an appointment package that it considers appropriate to recognise awards or benefits forfeited on resignation from a prior position, taking into account timing and valuation and other specific matters it considers relevant. This may take the form of cash and/or share awards. The maximum payment under any such arrangements (which may be in addition to normal variable remuneration) would be no more than the Committee considers is required to provide reasonable compensation to the incoming director and would not go beyond a like-for-like compensation. If a director is required to relocate in order to take up the position, the Company may consider reasonable relocation, travel, subsistence and any other incidental payments as appropriate. Any such payments will be at the discretion of the Committee. In the case of an employee who is promoted to the position of director, it is the Company's policy to honour pre-existing commitments in accordance with their terms.

Service agreements and letters of appointment
Each of the executive directors' service agreements is for a rolling term and may be terminated by the Company or the director by giving no more than twelve months' notice. The non-executive directors of the Company (including the chairman) do not have service agreements. The independent non-executive directors are appointed by letters of appointment and have an initial two-year term. Caleb Kramer's services are provided to the Company under an agreement between the Company and Oaktree Capital Management FIE LLC which runs for an initial period of three years. The initial terms of the non-executive directors' positions are subject to their re-election by the Group's shareholders at the AGM. The dates of appointments of the non-executive directors who served during the year are set out below:

Countrywide plc Annual Report 2016

Policy on payment for loss of office
If an executive director's employment is terminated, in the absence of a breach of service agreement by the director, the Company may (although it is not obliged to) terminate the director's employment immediately by payment of an amount equal to the basic salary and specified benefits (including pension scheme contribution or equivalent salary supplement payment) in lieu of the whole or the remaining part of the notice period. Discretionary bonus payments will not form part of any payments in lieu of notice. An annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the financial year served, although it would be paid in cash and pro-rated for time and paid at the normal payout date. Payments in lieu of notice may be paid in monthly instalments over the length of the notice period with such instalments to be reduced or to cease upon the director receiving payment from a new position. Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive director under the Company's share plans will be determined based on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the LTIP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances (such as ill health, injury or disability, retirement, transfer of the employing company outside of the Group or in other circumstances at the discretion of the Committee), `good leaver' status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will normally vest on the normal vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the performance period actually served. However, the Committee has discretion to determine that awards for good leavers vest at cessation and/or to disapply time pro-rating. In the event of death, awards will normally vest on the date of death subject to performance conditions and time pro-rating, although the Committee has discretion to determine that awards vest at the normal vesting date and/or to disapply time pro-rating. The default treatment for deferred bonus awards is that any outstanding awards vest on cessation of employment unless cessation is as a result of dismissal for gross misconduct or a similar `bad leaver' reason. The Company has the power to enter into settlement agreements with Directors and to pay compensation to settle potential legal claims. In addition, and consistent with market practice, in the event of the termination of an executive director, the Company may pay a contribution towards that individual's legal fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement. Any such fees will be disclosed as part of the detail of termination arrangements. For the avoidance of doubt, the policy does not include an explicit cap on the cost of termination payments. Corporate governance

External appointment of executive directors
The Board allows executive directors to accept appropriate outside non-executive director appointments provided the aggregate commitment is compatible with their duties as executive directors. The executive directors concerned may retain fees paid for these services, which will be subject to approval by the Board. Details of such appointments and fees retained for 2016 are disclosed on page 61.

PART B: annual report on remuneration
Implementation of the remuneration policy for the year ending 31 December 2017
Details of how the Committee intends to operate the remuneration policy for directors for the year ending 31 December 2017 are set out below. The Committee does not believe it to be in shareholders' interests to disclose the actual performance targets in advance for 2017 as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be presented in the 2017 annual report on remuneration. Malus and clawback provisions will continue to operate in respect of deferred bonus awards.

Base salary
Base salaries for the executive directors are reviewed annually by the Committee, taking account of the director's performance, experience and responsibilities. When determining base salaries, the Committee also has regard to economic factors, remuneration trends and the general level of salary increases awarded throughout the Group. As can be seen in the table below, the executive directors' base salaries will not be increased in 2017:
1 January 2016 £'000 1 January 2017 £'000

Long term incentives
The annual award of LTIPs to be granted in 2017 will be assessed over the three-year performance period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019 and will be subject to the following targets:

· EPS (37.5% of awards) ­ 25% of this part of an award will vest for · relative TSR (37.5% of awards) ­ the Company's TSR measured

EPS growth of 5% per annum increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for EPS compound growth of 15% per annum; against the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding financial services companies and investment trusts). 25% of this part of an award will vest for performance at median of the comparator group, increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting at upper quartile; and the Committee will use for this portion of the 2017 awards will relate to market share (as to 5% of the award), people engagement (10% of the award) and customer experience (e.g. NPS, 10% of the award). In addition, no element of this portion of the award will vest unless the Committee is satisfied that the Company's underlying performance warrants such vesting. The Committee does not believe it to be in shareholders' interests to disclose the actual targets in advance at this time as these include items which the Committee considers commercially sensitive. However, robust, quantifiable targets have been set, with these targets ­ together with performance against these targets ­ disclosed in the 2019 annual report on remuneration.

Annual bonus
For 2017, maximum bonus potential will continue to be 120% of salary for executive directors, with one-third of any bonus payable to be deferred into Company shares for a period of three years. The metrics used in 2017 will be as follows:

· 70% ­ Financial through: · 40% ­ Group adjusted EBITDA targets · 15% ­ Group revenue growth · 15% ­ Group cost to income ratio · 15% ­ Customer satisfaction metrics · 15% ­ Personal/strategic metrics
In addition, bonuses will only be payable under the non-EBITDA targets if the Committee is satisfied that the Company's underlying performance warrants such payments.

Alison Platt will receive an LTIP award over shares worth 150% of salary and Jim Clarke will receive an LTIP award over shares worth 130% of salary. Malus and clawback provisions will operate. In addition, awards made to executive directors from 2016 are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period. Shareholding guidelines will continue to operate, albeit on an enhanced basis. Executive directors will be required to retain no less than 50% of net of tax shares from vesting of share options or awards until such time as a shareholding equivalent in value to 200% of base salary (previously 100%) has been achieved.

Non-executive directors

1 Alison Platt acted as a non-executive director for Cable & Wireless Communications plc between January and April 2016 and retained a fee of £23,333, and also acted as a non-executive director for Tesco plc between April and December and retained a fee of £61,500. 2 Grenville Turner stepped down from his role as non-executive chairman on 27 April 2016, with Peter Long assuming this role on the same date (having been appointed as a non-executive director on 11 February 2016). 3 Benefits consist of the provision of a car allowance, life assurance and private medical and health insurance. 4 Details of the annual bonus targets and payments for 2016 (which were £Nil) are set out below. 5 Alison Platt and Jim Clarke received a 15% of salary supplement in lieu of pension entitlements. 6 Long term incentives in respect of the anticipated vesting of the IPO options were reported in full in 2014 (based on an 83% vesting level which had been determined on 2014 EBITDA performance criteria). The actual values at vesting of the first 50% crystallising on 18 March 2015 were £4,151,000 and £2,491,000 respectively for Grenville Turner and Jim Clarke based on the share price at vesting, incorporating the associated cash-settled dividend equivalents. The actual values at exercise of the final 50% crystallising on 18 March 2016 were £3,178,000 and £1,907,000 respectively for Grenville Turner and Jim Clarke based on the share price at vesting, incorporating the associated cash-settled dividend equivalents. As such, the total actual values of the crystallised IPO options at the dates of vesting were £7,329,000 and £4,398,000 respectively for Grenville Turner and Jim Clarke against the original estimates reported in 2014 of £7,116,000 and £4,269,000 respectively. 7 Matching shares are also issued to the eligible executive directors under the Share Incentive Plan, following the introduction of the employee-wide share incentive plan in 2013. The aggregate value of these in each year in respect of each executive director is disclosed within the SIP share awards below.

2016 annual bonus award (audited)
Executive directors had the potential to receive an annual bonus of up to 120% of base salary.

Group adjusted EBITDA targets (up to 70% of salary bonus)
The primary driver of the award was based on Group adjusted EBITDA performance relative to a sliding scale of challenging targets set at the start of the financial year. More particularly, the table below sets out details of the adjusted EBITDA targets, performance against these targets and the resultant bonus outturn:
Performance required Measure Weighting Threshold On-target Maximum Actual Payout

Customer satisfaction and personal/strategic targets (up to 30% of bonus)
This part of the bonus was based on the Committee's assessment of performance against customer satisfaction and personal/strategic targets. Details of the targets and the Committee's assessment of performance against them is as follows:
Target Weighting Committee's assessment of whether target was met

Customer satisfaction (i.e. Group net promoter score) Personal/strategic targets

15% (i.e. up to 18% of salary) 15% (i.e. up to 18% of salary)

n/a due to overall financial result n/a due to overall financial result

However, this element of the bonus was only payable to the extent that a threshold level of financial performance was delivered. As this threshold level of financial performance was not delivered, no portion of this element of bonus was payable.

Therefore, based on overall performance, and notwithstanding performance against the customer satisfaction and personal/strategic targets, the Committee determined that no bonuses are payable to the executive directors for 2016.

Vesting of scheme interests in respect of the year ended 31 December 2016 (audited)
Awards granted under the LTIP to Alison Platt and Jim Clarke on 8 September 2014 and 21 March 2014 respectively are due to vest on their third anniversaries of grant in 2017 based upon absolute EPS and relative TSR performance as follows:

As explained in last year's report, these award levels ­ which are higher than the standard policy award levels of 150% and 130% of salary for the CEO and CFO respectively but well within the overall plan limit ­ were considered appropriate to take account of the specific circumstances that existed at the time. Performance targets for these awards are as follows:

· EPS growth (one-half) ­ 25% of this part of an award will vest for achieving a minimum of 5% compound growth per annum in EPS
increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting for achieving 15% compound growth per annum in EPS for the three-year period ending 31 December 2018; and

· relative TSR (one-half) ­ the Company's TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE 250 (excluding financial services companies
and investment trusts). 25% of this part of an award will vest for performance at median of comparator group, increasing pro-rata to 100% vesting at upper quartile. Following discussions with investors, the originally proposed weighting between EPS and TSR of two-thirds to one-third was changed to 50:50 as described above.

All members of the Committee are considered independent non-executive directors. The chairman of the Committee reports on the Committee's activities to the Board at the meeting immediately following the Committee meeting.

Consideration by the directors of matters relating to directors' remuneration
Membership of Board Committees that considered remuneration (both the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee (when directors are appointed)) are disclosed within the corporate governance section of the annual report. Invitations to attend are also extended to executive management where appropriate. At the start of the year, the Committee received advice on remuneration from New Bridge Street, part of Aon plc.

When conducting its review of the remuneration policy, the Committee took account of the fact that, while 79% of shareholders who voted on the 2016 remuneration report were supportive, a significant number of shareholders voted against this resolution, primarily due to the fact that higher LTIP awards were made in 2016 with lower EPS targets (in absolute terms) than had been applied to previous awards. As explained above, the new policy does not envisage LTIP awards being made in excess of 150% of salary, with a revised approach proposed in relation to the performance conditions that are to apply to these awards.
