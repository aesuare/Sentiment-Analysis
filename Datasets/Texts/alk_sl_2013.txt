To Our Shareholders:

2013 was another excellent year for Alaska Air Group. It was a record year in many respects, adding to a growing trend of great performance and execution -- both financially and operationally. I'd like to share some of our accomplishments with you, along with some of our thoughts about the future. But before I do, I want to give you some background on how far we've come.

Alaska's history dates back 82 years and over those years we've seen a tremendous amount of change that has reshaped the industry and our company. We've experienced government regulation and de-regulation, economic peaks and valleys, including the "Great Recession," a fuel crisis, the terrorist attacks of September 11, and several rounds of consolidation. Through it all, airlines have come and gone -- many disappearing altogether and many more restructuring through bankruptcy. Today, the industry looks nothing like it did 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago. Service has improved, airlines are more stable, and they're performing better financially (though the industry's combined result since the Wright Brothers took off at Kitty Hawk is still a net loss!). A few airlines, led by Alaska Air Group, are returning capital to shareholders in meaningful ways -- a very positive sign of real change. We'll have to see if the industry's improved performance persists, but the last few years look good and many experts expect further improvement in the next few. So, a question I sometimes ask is: "Through all of this change, why is Alaska Air Group still here?" We're a relatively small player in the U.S.airline industry with around 3.5% of the flown capacity and we're competing against carriers that are as much as eight times our size. Yet, we are still here -- and we are still Alaska Airlines. My answer -- and this is based on what customers frequently tell us -- is that it's because of our people and, in particular, because of the friendly and personal service they provide. Sure, there are other factors -- a safe and industry-leading operation, low fares, a focus on low costs, and dedication to doing the right thing. But, at the end of the day, all of these things are due to our people. So that leads us to 2013. Here is a short list of the things our people accomplished: · First, we continue to be safe. Both Alaska and Horizon have strong safety records, and we are working to get better every day. Safety is our top priority and the foundation for everything else we do. Second, we received our sixth consecutive J.D. Power Award for Highest in Customer Satisfaction Among Traditional Network Carriers in North America. This is one of the most respected measures of service in our industry, and we are very proud to have received this recognition from our customers. Third, our operational performance continued to lead the industry, with 87% of our mainline flights completed on time. Flightstats.com ranked Alaska the No. 1 major airline in North America for the fourth consecutive year and The Wall Street Journal rated us the best major airline in the nation in two of the last three years. Fourth, we finalized new five-year agreements with Alaska's pilots and Horizon's flight attendants, and we recently reached a tentative five-year agreement with Alaska's clerical, office, and passenger service personnel. We are optimistic we'll reach agreement with Alaska's flight attendants on a new contract soon. We are at our best when our people are onboard and fully engaged, and we're pleased to have long-term contracts in place for most of our employee groups. Fifth, we met or exceeded nearly all of our operational and financial goals, which resulted in record incentive pay for our employees. Each employee at Alaska and Horizon received a bonus that represents at least 4½ weeks of pay. As the company performs well, our employees are rewarded, and we strongly believe this alignment benefits all of our stakeholders.

Sixth, significant company contributions over the last decade and favorable market conditions have resulted in fully funded defined-benefit pension plans. We've restructured many of our legacy airline benefits, including shifting to defined-contribution plans, which allows us to compete on a more equal footing with low-cost airlines. And last, but certainly not least, we are leading the industry in creating value for our shareholders. For 2013, we reported $383 million of adjusted net income, a 12.4% pre-tax margin, a 13.6% return on invested capital, and $415 million of free cash flow. These are all records. Strong profits over the last several years and the balanced use of free cash flow have produced one of the best balance sheets in the industry. Debt and operating leases are now just 35% of our capital structure and we have no net debt.

And we are returning capital to shareholders. During 2013, we declared a dividend for the first time in 21 years, and in early 2014 we increased it by 25%. We bought back 2.5 million shares of our stock in 2013, and we have now repurchased 21 million shares over the last seven years. We are committed to providing strong, sustainable returns for our owners. We take pride in seeing our company grow and perform well. And we're excited about raising the bar as we move forward. As we look ahead, there are some big challenges coming our way, not the least of which is the addition of significant new competition in our core West Coast markets. In response, we have undertaken a number of initiatives designed to make the service we provide to our customers and our communities even better. It's because of our people that we can face the future with confidence, and all 13,000 of us know that if we want to continue as a strong and independent airline, it is imperative that we perform well for our customers, our communities, our employees and most importantly, our owners. We're looking forward to doing just that. I'm incredibly honored to lead the best group of people in the industry, and we appreciate your support of and your investment in Alaska Air Group. Sincerely,

Brad Tilden Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
