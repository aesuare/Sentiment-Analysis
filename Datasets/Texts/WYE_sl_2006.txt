THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY The Indian pharmaceutical market valued at Rs. 27901.99 crores recorded a growth of 14.3 % during the year ended 31st March, 2007. (Source IMS MAT March, 2007). Alimentary Tract and Metabolism products and Systemic AntiInfectives constituted a major portion (44.84%) of the total market. Other segments like Cardiovascular System and Respiratory System are growing at a fast rate. FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE The sales for the year ended 31st March, 2007 were Rs. 288.13 crores (previous year Rs. 287.29 crores) which represent a marginal increase over the previous year. The Company maintains its leadership position in Oral Contraceptives, Hormone Therapy, Folic Acid and Depilatory Cream Segments. Excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses/(income), profit for the year is Rs.109.7 crores as compared to Rs. 96.4 crores in the previous year showing a growth of 13.8%. The growth in profits is mainly due to improved efficiencies and control on operating expenses. OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS, RISKS AND CONCERNS Introduction of the Product Patent regime was a welcome step taken by the Government. However, the overrestrictive interpretation of the scope of patentability and lack of protection of clinical data continue to be causes for concern. The provision for pre-grant oppositions is also a matter of serious concern. The new Drug Pricing legislation is yet to be announced. Increase in the span of price control would work to the detriment of the pharmaceutical industry. The Consumer Health Care division launched the 60 gm tube pack of its product Anne French during the year under review. This initiative has been well received by the consumers and the trade. This division is working towards strengthening the consumer franchise for the Analgesics and Hair Remover products. OUTLOOK The Company continues to invest in all the promoted brands to increase sales and profitability and thus increase stakeholder value. CAUTIONARY NOTE Certain statements in the Management Discussion and Analysis Section may be forward looking and are stated as required by the applicable laws and regulations. The future results of the Company may be affected by many factors, which could be different from what the Directors envisage in terms of future performance and outlook. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS The Company has adequate internal control systems with appropriate control checks commensurate with its size and nature of business. These measures ensure efficient use and protection of all assets of the Company and also compliance with the policies, procedures and statutory requirements. All transactions are recorded in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. KPMG (the Internal Auditors) regularly conducts a review of the financial and operating controls in all areas of the Company's operations and significant issues, if any, are brought to the attention of the Audit Committee of the Board for necessary action. HUMAN RESOURCES/INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS The Company continues to focus on its core values of Quality, Integrity, Respect for People, Leadership and Collaboration.
