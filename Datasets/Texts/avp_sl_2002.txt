Message to shareholders
 We are very pleased to report that Avon delivered outstanding perform- ance again in 2002, despite serious economic challenges all year long.
The year was truly an inflection point in the trans- formation of Avon, characterized by across-the-board strategic progress as well as financial results that
met or exceeded targets every quarter for the third consecutive year. And in another year of depressed stock prices, Avon’s shares rose 16%, outperforming our competitors and the S&P 500. For the three years under current management, Avon shares have delivered a cumulative total return of 72%–an enviable performance in the face of the most severe stock market downturn in over half a century.
Avon achieved virtually all of its financial targets for the year: Double-digit growth in local currency

sales, driven by record unit growth of 13% and a 10% increase in active Representatives; a 50 basis- point operating margin expansion (excluding unusual items); double-digit earnings-per-share growth; and $565 million in operating cash flow, even after $120 million in U.S. pension plan contributions.
Breakout Performance > Our 2002 results in major markets around the world demonstrate the soundness of our strategies and the strength of our manage- ment. And, our performance is further evidence that our direct selling business model and positive brand image give Avon a unique advantage in markets of all types, even in the face of economic headwinds and stiff competition.
In the U.S., for example, we have stayed the course on strategies to make direct selling a more attractive career opportunity and to make Avon
a more aspirational brand. The result has been remarkable, with the U.S. last year posting one of its best years ever, and attracting a record number of Representatives. Sales grew by over 6% for
the second straight year – well above the 3.7% compound annual growth rate for the period 1995-2000–driven by 7% growth in beauty products. Just as noteworthy, U.S. profit margins were at a record level, as we ramped up supply chain and other Business Transformation initiatives

to free up resources. And we see even greater opportunities going forward.
Similar strategic success stories are evident in other regions as well. Fast growing and highly profitable Central/Eastern Europe is now a $500 million mar- ket for Avon, and we are the number-one beauty brand in most countries. The region has become a model for other Avon markets by consistently invest- ing in consumer marketing to build brand awareness and by leveraging resources across borders to reduce costs, improve service and expand margins.
In Latin America–an Avon stronghold for decades–our direct selling channel and brand image proved once again that we have the most competitive business model among our peers. The region faced the most difficult economic and political pressures in many years, and despite the obstacles, Avon posted a 13% increase in local currency sales, largely by recruiting 10% more Representatives to sell Avon and supplement their incomes.
And in Asia, Avon’s business in China continues to gather momentum on the strength of consumer demand for our products and dramatic expansion of our retail infrastructure. China is sure to be one of Avon’s biggest future opportunities, especially with anticipated return of direct selling as an approved method of distribution in the world’s largest market.
Strategic Progress On All Fronts > Avon’s focus on Beauty as a major driver of sales and customer loyalty was evidenced by a 12% gain in local currency beauty sales for the year. We continued to market innovative, high-quality brands and to invest in

As a result, the number of active Representatives last year was at a record 3.9 million – our third consecu- tive year of double-digit gains.
A key catalyst for this growth is Sales Leadership, which enables Representatives to increase their earnings by recruiting and training others. In markets where it has been implemented, Leadership Repre- sentatives have become a major portion of the sales force, which significantly increases overall recruiting.
In the U.S., for example, 45% of our Representa- tives are participating in Leadership, up from 38% last year, while Brazil’s participation rate is 29% and growing rapidly. As a result, both markets reported record numbers of Representatives during the year.

In 2002, more than 25 Avon markets tested various local approaches to Leadership. Moving forward, we are developing a global template in order to imple- ment a consistent Leadership model in major markets.
Accelerating Future Growth > Your management also laid plans in 2002 to attract new customers to Avon. Our new global beauty brand – called mark.–for women ages 16-24 will launch in the U.S. in fall 2003 with an exciting line of beauty products, a compelling direct selling opportunity, and a unique brand experience that engages young women in the Avon traditions of relationship and empowerment.

This is a tremendous opportunity. Our research shows that there are 300 million young women
in the target age group in our top 30 markets who spend over $200 billion annually on consumer goods. The mark. brand will enable Avon to reach these young women who represent future generations of Avon consumers and Representatives.
What’s more, a substantial number of our U.S. Representatives know a great many young women in this demographic, allowing us to start recruiting and selling within an affinity group that is already connected to Avon.

pany, gained traction in 2002 and further bolstered our confidence that Avon will continue to achieve its financial targets.
We reduced costs by over $60 million through Business Transformation during the year, mainly
from supply chain reengineering and efficiencies
in our operating model. All regions are moving forward with Business Transformation initiatives, and we expect to generate an incremental net savings of approximately $120 million in 2003, as we advance to our goal of $400 million in savings by year-end 2004.
These savings are having two important impacts on your company’s long-term outlook. First, they are helping us increase profitability. For 2003 and 2004, we expect operating margin to expand
100 basis points each year, which is a significant acceleration from the 2002 increase.
In addition, Business Transformation is freeing up resources for reinvestment in our growth strategies. In 2003, we plan to invest approximately $50 million incrementally, on top of the $140 million invested since 2000. Investment priorities include our continu- ing drive for beauty market share, global expansion of Sales Leadership and the launch of mark.
Looking ahead, your management believes that Avon’s most exciting days are still to come. Your company’s performance in 2002 sets a solid founda- tion for the future, and Business Transformation will provide the fuel to unleash breakout results.
We are fortunate to be guided by the expertise of our outstanding Board of Directors, and we
