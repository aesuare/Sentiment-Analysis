TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS
OUR WORK
IS PRODUCING RESULTS
This is a great time to be part of Team Caterpillar—and the future promises to be even more rewarding. With our current outlook, projected sales and revenues should be close to $40 billion in 2006. That means we will have nearly doubled the size of our company in just three years, thanks to customers worldwide who have placed their trust and confidence in our products and services — and thanks to a global team of employees, dealers and suppliers who are working hand-in- hand to address the strong surge in customer demand. We’re in the midst of the most aggressive new product introduction campaign in our history and rapidly growing our service businesses. We’re making great gains in employee safety, engagement and diversity. And we’re laser-focused on reach- ing the 2010 targets in our new enterprise strategy.
I feel incredibly good about our accomplishments, but even better about the fact that we’re not stopping here. At a time when business is going well, when we’re hitting on all cylinders in the marketplace and growing around the world, our people are thinking about how we can improve and are putting substantive plans in place to get even better. As I said in this letter last year, I can’t think of another company
in any industry that is better positioned to win in the global economy. Our vision is to be recognized as a great employer, an outstanding investment and an admired global leader committed to making progress possible around the world. I believe we’re well on our way.
ANOTHER RECORD YEAR
In 2005, we again achieved record financial results. Our sales and revenues were up 20 percent, reaching $36.34 billion. Our earnings of $2.85 billion were up 40 percent and reached $4.04 per share, our second consecutive year of record profits. And prospects for continued strong results are promising. We enter 2006 with one of the largest order backlogs in our history, particularly for large machines, engines and turbines — indicating continued market strength in the year ahead. And there are strong economic winds at our back. We’re three years into a period of explosive growth in all the major market segments we serve — global mining, global

Caterpillar’s record profits and strong cash flow enabled us to reinvest in the business, improve funding of employee benefit plans and reward our stock- holders. We focused on growing the business by reinvesting $1.20 billion in capital expenditures (excluding equipment leased to others). For our employees, we improved the already well-funded status of our pension plans by contributing $912 million. For our stockholders, we increased the dividend 22 percent, our eleventh increase in the last twelve years, and repurchased nearly 34 million shares. Finally, we improved our financial strength as our stockholders’ equity increased $965 million. These actions significantly enhanced stockholder value.

     Solid growth also continues in each of our major service businesses. Cat Financial is an integral part of our business model, contributing $364 million in profit in 2005. With a portfolio of $24 billion in receivables, it maintains a solid investment grade credit rating. Cat Financial enables many customers to acquire our products, and we’ve demonstrated that it has solid earnings stability — instrumental in our ability to maintain attractive profitability throughout the business cycle. The insurance arm of our financial products division pro- vides cost-effective extended warranty coverage to customers and is also growing rapidly. In addition, Cat Logistics recorded double-digit growth in 2005 and announced new contracts to propel future growth, including Cat Logistics’ largest deal ever — a service parts distribution agreement with General Motors Europe.
INCREASING OUR PRESENCE IN GROWING MARKETS
Overall, business remains strong not only in the established markets of North America, Europe and Japan but in the emerging markets as well. We have teams on the ground establishing our proven global business model in China, India and Russia.
In China, we continue to make great strides, quickly expand- ing our dealer network, product line and logistics capabilities and offering Cat Financial services in-country. Achieving our vision means being a cost-effective competitor in every major currency zone, and doing so requires a solid manufacturing and supply base in those areas of the world. Yet, even as we grow worldwide, we will continue to maintain a strong U.S. manufacturing presence with significant exports.
A NEW STRATEGIC VISION
Significantly better execution is a key focus of our new enter- prise strategy, developed and introduced to all employees in 2005. The first in a series of five-year strategic plans leading to our Vision 2020, the new strategy includes specific goals in the areas of people, product and process performance and profitable growth. While not a dramatic shift in direction, it does set aggressive targets — particularly in the areas of employee safety, product quality and customer order-to- delivery capability — and it puts a strong focus on rapid alignment and execution across all 30 of our business units.

Our 22 autonomous profit center business units, sup- ported by eight service center units, are all driving for solid leadership positions in their respective markets and the prod- uct line. This organizational structure encourages the entre- preneurial zeal that will ensure our continued success in the global marketplace. And based on our leadership team’s and employees’ enthusiastic response to the roll-out of our new strategy, we are confident in our ability to deliver on these goals if the projected market environment materializes.
CATERPILLAR VALUES
At the foundation of our strategy is Our Values in Action, the update to our Worldwide Code of Conduct, first published in 1974. Our updated Code is now clearly defined by the values and behaviors that have made us successful for 80 years — and will drive our success in the future. We are justifiably proud of our strong ethical standards, but we know we can do more to build a values-based culture, particularly as we expand worldwide. In 2005, we added more than 8,000 employees, and as we continue to grow to meet demand, we must stay focused on hiring the best people and integrating them into
our culture. By living our values, we are building one global Team Caterpillar — where we serve customers, develop people and leaders, focus on employee satisfaction and create an enriching environment for all who work here. In fact, during my 33 years with Caterpillar, I’ve never been prouder of this organization than I am today. Thanks to a strong focus on integrity, excellence, teamwork and commitment, we accom- plished great things in 2005 — many of which you can read about in this report.
One key to that is our ongoing effort to encode 6 Sigma disciplines into our daily work. Today more than 3,600 black belts are leading teams and nearly 36,000 employees are contributing to 6 Sigma projects worldwide. These teams are generating significant improvements in our key focus areas of employee safety, product quality and product availability. They also have played a major role in our ability to ramp up production dramatically within our existing facilities — and to help many suppliers break through capacity bottlenecks at the same time.

OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABLE PROGRESS
Just as we are looking to encode 6 Sigma into Caterpillar’s DNA, we also are focused on raising the profile of sustainable development within our company. Enabling development is at the heart of our business, and doing so in an increasingly sustainable manner holds great benefits for our company, our customers and our world. We’re proud of the progress made to date — including five straight years on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index — and we are issuing our first-ever sustainability report in conjunction with this annual report. Our goal is not just to report on what we’ve accomplished, but also to set definitive goals for what we’re working to achieve by 2010.
One element of sustainable development for Caterpillar is helping communities rebuild after natural disasters. During 2005 we were challenged to respond to a number of tragedies around the world, including the tsunami in Asia, a horrific hurricane season along the U.S. Gulf Coast and earthquakes in South Asia. Cat® equipment, dealers and employees pro- vided as much relief of human suffering as possible and today are helping people in the affected areas rebuild their lives.
Our quick, compassionate response made me proud to be part of the Caterpillar team.
GLOBAL LEADERSHIP
Overall, our product line remains the global leader, number one or two in virtually every market we serve, and we are committed to delivering the best quality to our customers. Our brands are strong and recognized worldwide as the highest in customer value. Our global manufacturing footprint is well established, with a highly integrated supply chain. Our distribution, sales, rental and product support capabilities are stronger than any competitor, delivering a terrific value proposition to our demanding customer base. Our service businesses are growing at a record pace. Further, our invest- ments in product technology are growing, and our employees are the best and most experienced in the business.
MORE RECORD YEARS AHEAD
With all this, we feel good about our growth potential. In 2010, we’re targeting $50 billion in sales and revenues with 15 to 20 percent interim annual growth in earnings per share. We’re

         off to a strong start with a good line of sight to delivering these goals. Hitting these targets will continue to position Caterpillar as an outstanding investment opportunity.
That’s not to say we don’t have challenges. We do. First is safety. The health and well-being of our employees come above all else. None of our other goals matter if people are injured in the process of achieving them. We’ve made good progress the past few years, and the metrics in our new strategy will push us to improve even faster as we move toward our ultimate goal of zero injuries. Maintaining product quality standards also is critical. Quality is one of the reasons customers choose our equipment—it’s the hallmark of our reputation—but our quality levels have hit a plateau in recent years. To remain the market leader, we must make breakthrough improvements in product quality now. The same is true for product availability. We must improve our order-to- delivery processes so we can get our products to customers when they need them and faster than any competitor, all at lower costs and with less inventory tied up in our supply chain.
None of these challenges has an easy solution. But our team is committed to addressing them, and we’ve set aggressive goals and timelines for success. And those of you who know Caterpillar know this: When we say we’ll do something, we do it. We’ve proven that time and time again during our 80-year history. That’s why I am so excited about our company’s future. We have embarked on the “good to great” journey. We are committed to taking what is a very good company today and making it better, because we know what all our stakeholders expect — and deserve — is an even better Caterpillar tomorrow.
Jim Owens, Chairman and CEO Caterpillar Inc.
