  DEAR FELLOW SHAREHOLDERS
    CALPINE — America’s largest independent power producer and a name synonymous with clean, modern, efficient,flexiblepowergeneration. That’swhoweare and — as clean air policies take root, coal-to-gas switching continues or the economy strengthens — we expect demand for our clean, flexible and efficient generation to increase, leading to more success in delivering greater shareholder value to you.
In 2011, we delivered solid operational and financial results, achieved commercial successes and continued financially disciplined growth. Last year we:
• Generated over 94 million megawatt hours (MWhs) of electricity for our customers;
• Originated nearly 1,400 MWs of new long-term contracts at our Pastoria, Carville and Auburndale power plants;
• Completed 10 turbine upgrades for a total of 91 MWs of incremental capacity;
• Commenced construction on a net 584 MWs at our Russell City and Los Esteros power plants and secured attractive related financing;
• Launched a $300 million share repurchase program; and
• For the third consecutive year, achieved shareholder
return in excess of 20%.
Looking ahead to 2012 and beyond, we remain
committed to delivering long-term shareholder value. Calpine’s competitive, efficient and flexible power generation fleet is benefitting from the current low natural gas price environment, which is driving unprecedented amounts of coal-to-gas switching. Furthermore, we are encouraged by factors specific to each of our core markets:
• In ERCOT, supply and demand are tight and regulators are working to ensure that wholesale power prices adequately reflect scarcity price signals.
• In PJM, supply and demand should tighten as we reach mid-decade as a result of power plant retirements being drivenbycleanairregulationsandcoal-to-gasswitching.
• In California, regulators are increasingly focused on the need to fairly compensate existing and flexible generation that is critical to the integration of intermittent renewable resources.
• In the Southeast, utility customers appear increasingly interested in long-term power purchase agreements that attractively monetize our power plants.
Finally, we will continue to look for opportunities to monetize current assets giving us flexibility to reallocate our capital in a manner that drives shareholder value over the long term.
To be sure, the road ahead has its challenges, including forward power prices that are currently unreflective of market fundamentals, state interference with competitive wholesale markets and slowdowns on clean air regulations. Yet we expect to continue to deliver shareholder value through operational excellence, execution on commercial opportunities with our customers, pursuit of financially disciplined growth and optimization of our balance sheet — in short, by keeping Calpine a generation ahead, today.
Thank you for your continued support. Sincerely,
    1
