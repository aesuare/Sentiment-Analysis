 O’REILLY AUTOMOTIVE 2005 ANNUAL REPORT
   2005 was truly a momentous year for Team O’Reilly.
We again realized significant expansion in our store base through aggressive growth in existing and new markets and the successful acquisition and integration of Midwest Auto Parts Distributors. Due to the dedication of our team members, we were able to overcome the extreme challenges presented by the Gulf Coast hurricanes with very little disruption to the service that we provide to our customers. We are also pleased to report that we have reached the milestone of $2 billion in sales this year, which was our “2-4-Your Future” goal that we set in 2002 to reach $2 billion in sales within four years.
The achievement of our “2-4-Your Future” goal was the result of the continued dedication from our Professional Parts People working together as one team, striving for one goal. Product sales rose to $2.05 billion in 2005, an 18.8%
increase over 2004, and net income, before the cumulative effect of accounting change, increased 39.6% to $164.3 million in 2005. Our comparable store sales growth of 7.5% was among the best in the industry, continuing the tradition of market leadership by O’Reilly. Our overall operating margin improved to 12.3% in 2005, the best level ever for the Company. This performance was made possible by initiatives such as our improved wholesale pricing system and refinement of our merchandising mix, as well as ongoing incremental improvements in our merchandise acquisition costs which have been facilitated by our growth.
In addition to achieving the exceptional financial performance that our shareholders have come to expect, our stock price has continued to climb and set new records in 2005. In May, our Board of Directors declared a two- for-one stock split as a result of our continued financial performance and their confidence in our future success.
The acquisition of Midwest has proven to be an excellent fit for O’Reilly, both geographically and operationally. The Midwest acquisition provides O’Reilly
a presence in Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. These six Northern Plains states are a bolt-on growth area to our existing territory and expand our presence to 25 contiguous states. We are excited about the opportunities these new markets present and we are well along the way in evaluating sites for

throughout 2006 as we relocate or renovate stores based upon our evaluation of market size, store location and competition. We also will complete the changeovers of the product lines in the Midwest stores which will allow us to serve our customers with a better merchandise assortment. We also are planning to roll out our new point of sale computer system which will allow our team members to more efficiently process customer transactions and speed up team member training.
Our team excelled in meeting numerous challenges in 2005 by living the O’Reilly Culture, which serves as the theme for this year’s Annual Report. This was never more evident than in the response by Team O’Reilly to the difficult circumstances created by the Gulf Coast hurricanes. With our team beside us, we are excited about the prospects for 2006. We continue to be encouraged by the fundamentals and prospects for our industry and are confident in our

A mix of quality inventory and value pricing matched with our Professional Parts People lets our customers trust in their local O'Reilly store for all of their car care needs. This relationship created by our team members has resulted in us reaching our long-time goal of $2 billion in sales for 2005.
expansion. Midwest’s operations have also proven to
be a complement to our business model. Midwest had
a track record of success in customer service to both the professional installer and the do-it-yourselfer. This is directly in line with our proven dual market strategy.
We have been exceptionally pleased with the high degree of dedication and professionalism that characterize the Midwest team members. We are extremely fortunate
to have added these team members to our ranks of Professional Parts People.
In addition to the 72 stores added in the acquisition of Midwest Auto Parts, we opened 149 new stores in 2005 primarily in the Southeast and Texas. We continued to expand the most extensive distribution network in the industry with the addition of Midwest’s distribution centers in St. Paul, Minnesota and Billings, Montana and the opening of our distribution center in Atlanta, Georgia.
Building upon our proven and industry-leading growth model, we are planning continued aggressive growth in 2006. We have established a goal to open 170 to 175 new stores in 2006 and will open our 14th distribution center, a 405,000 square foot facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. Our integration efforts with Midwest will continue

growth opportunities in existing and expansion markets. As we continue to strive toward our goal of being the dominant supplier of auto parts in our market areas, our key advantage will be the culture that was established by our founders almost 50 years ago. This culture has been fostered ever since those beginnings and is at the heart of everything we do as we “Live Green.”
