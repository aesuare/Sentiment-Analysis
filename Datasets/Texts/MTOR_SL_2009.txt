This year was a turning point for ArvinMeritor. We made substantial progress in
the transformation of our company through the sale of many of our light vehicle
businesses, with only the Body Systems business and a relatively minor portion
of our Chassis business remaining in our light vehicle segment. We made the
strategic decision to concentrate on our commercial vehicle and industrial
businesses, which will allow a keener focus on more attractive, targeted
investments with potentially higher margins.
Therefore, we recently announced that we would report the company’s financial
results in four segments: Commercial Truck, Industrial, Aftermarket & Trailer,
and Light Vehicle Systems. We intend to grow our commercial truck segment –
the heritage of ArvinMeritor dating back to 1909 – in all regions by expanding
our global axle and brake leadership positions, developing technologies to
improve fuel efficiency and vehicle safety, and strengthening electronics and
controls capabilities. In our Industrial segment, we anticipate expanding our
presence in the off-highway, industrial and defense markets through new
customers and products designed to meet customized specifications. And
we plan to continue to expand our aftermarket product portfolio and
remanufacturing business into emerging markets using our proven expertise
in establishing distribution networks and systems infrastructures.
In fiscal year 2009, sales from continuing operations were $4.1 billion, down
36% from fiscal year 2008 due to the effects of the global economic
downturn. As the economic crisis unfolded, we took immediate actions. Since
early in calendar year 2009, we steadily increased our liquidity position while
simultaneously reducing our net debt, including the debt-like off-balance sheet
factoring and securitization programs.
Our global team of 13,200 employees in 25 countries demonstrated
perseverance and commitment to our long-term goals even as we aggressively
executed a plan to reduce costs across all areas of the company. We continued
to implement and execute our long-term profit improvement and cost reduction
initiative called Performance Plus which was launched in fiscal year 2007. We
further responded to the weakness in global business conditions in fiscal year 2009
by aggressively lowering our break-even point through comprehensive restructuring
and cost-reduction initiatives. Through these actions, we achieved $195 million of
savings in our core businesses. And, on a go-forward basis, we have reduced our
overall structural cost by approximately $136 million.
This year, we grew our
relationship with long-time
customers and formed new
partnerships with others. At
Navistar, Meritor axles are
now in standard position on
International medium-duty
trucks, school buses and
commercial buses. Under
the terms of this long-term
supply agreement,
ArvinMeritor also gained
additional standard axle
position on International’s
heavy-duty trucks. In
addition, we extended our
relationship with Daimler
Trucks North America under a long-term agreement to supply axles, brakes and
drivelines for Freightliner and Western Star trucks.
In our military business, we began production of a high mobility, all-wheel drive
module for the Navistar MXT – an armored Personnel Carrier for the British Ministry
of Defence. The module features our patented Meritor TACTX™ High Mobility
Independent Suspension offering best-in-class performance for military vehicles in
extreme environments.
We are also applying our unique capability in developing specialized drivetrain
solutions for our customers Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems for the technology
demonstration phase of the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) – a joint Army and
Marine Corps program anticipated to be the largest of its kind in the next
two decades.
To further support our planned growth in Asia Pacific and strengthen our
engineering capabilities globally, we moved to a new technical center in Bangalore,
India, this year. This office, which will grow to more than 100 employees, will
enable us to provide advanced product design and development for the region, and
will be closely coordinated with ArvinMeritor’s other technical centers in Troy, U.S.;
Cameri, Italy; and Cwmbran, U.K.
In China, we began a new relationship with the Yutong Group, the country’s largest
professional bus manufacturer. Through a strategic agreement, ArvinMeritor will
supply Yutong with drivetrain components for buses and coaches, in addition to
selling and distributing aftermarket parts in the region. And, to meet the needs of
China’s growing demand for off-highway vehicles, we are committed to increasing
our capacity and product offering at Xuzhou Meritor Axle Co. Ltd. (XMAL), our joint
venture with Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group (XCMG), the leader in China’s
construction machinery industry. We recently completed prototypes for our first
regionally developed product for XCMG leveraging ArvinMeritor’s global product
development centers.

In Brazil, we are planning a significant investment to support our expansion into
new product segments as well as new manufacturing technology. Through our
manufacturing facility in Osasco and our joint venture companies – Freios Master
and Suspensys with the Randon Corp. – we will continue to be a strong
commercial vehicle supplier in Brazil and across the continent. As testimony to our
focus on the customer, our Osasco, Brazil, operation – which supports both
commercial vehicle original equipment and aftermarket customers – was selected
as “Best of the Best” and “Best Partner in Developments” by MAN Latin America.
This recognition reflects our successful partnership with MAN in its modular
consortium, a revolutionary supplier model in operation at the Volkswagen Truck
and Bus plant in Resende, Brazil, where ArvinMeritor manufactures and
assembles axles and suspensions in a “mini-plant” environment. MAN Latin
America also recognized our Suspensys joint venture for its social responsibility
initiatives in the region.
Our product portfolio consisting of drivetrain systems and components for original
equipment manufacturers and the aftermarket is growing as we develop solutions
to meet the efficiency, reliability and durability needs of our wide range
of customers.
Leveraging our core design and engineering capabilities, we launched the Meritor
MXL extended lube driveline, which provides our customers with reduced
maintenance costs and longer service intervals. And we introduced ArvinMeritor’s
new PlatinumShield™ technology, offering revolutionary corrosion resistance
protection for original equipment and aftermarket truck and trailer brake shoes.
The PlatinumShield™ coating was developed by ArvinMeritor’s brake engineering
team to resist micro-abrasion – improving safety and helping North American
truck operators reduce their brake maintenance needs.
In the United States, new federal stopping distance regulations take effect in
August 2011 for Class 8 tractors. Through a variety of upgrades to our Meritor Q
Plus drum brakes product line, we will be ready to meet our customers’ needs
before the legislation takes effect. ArvinMeritor also offers a variety of air disc
brake solutions through the Meritor WABCO joint venture.
In the aftermarket, we expanded our portfolio for commercial vehicles with
remanufactured Allison automatic transmissions. The new remanufactured
transmissions will operate on a wide range of vocational truck and bus
applications and will meet our customers’ requirements for performance, service
life and product support at a fraction of the cost of a new component, while also
providing the environmental benefit of extending the productive life of a part. We
also expanded our aftermarket remanufacturing sales to new OEM customers and
independent distributors in North America through Canadian-based Mascot and in
Europe through Trucktechnic, located in Liège, Belgium.
As we reflect on our 100-year history, we are proud of our performance in a very
difficult year. The fabric of ArvinMeritor is made of dedicated employees with deep
knowledge and experience; products our customers want and need; an efficient
manufacturing and supply chain network; and a leadership team that has
demonstrated the ability to act quickly and decisively. While the timing of the
recovery of the global markets remains unclear, we have positioned ourselves as a
much leaner, more flexible organization prepared to capitalize on the certain
upturn in our markets.
In 2010, we will enter into new customer relationships in both mature and
developing markets. We will introduce new products including the MT-14X
tandem axle in North America; and we intend to continue to identify and
pursue ways to profitably grow the business while simultaneously
strengthening our balance sheet. We will remain diligent in managing costs
and improving operational excellence in all areas by continuing to apply the
principles of Performance Plus and the ArvinMeritor Production System, both
of which are now an integral part of our culture. We will invest wisely in
research and development to create products that are more energy efficient
like the MS-17X axle for European linehaul and bus applications, while also
incorporating electronics and controls that make our products smarter. And,
we will remain committed to reducing the company’s footprint on the
environment through the reduction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
emissions, waste generation, water consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions.
As we continue our transformation, we will differentiate who we are and what
we stand for just as we have for the past 100 years – and in so doing we will
expand our market-leading positions around the world.
