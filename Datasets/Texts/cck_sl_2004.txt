CROWN

Dear Fellow Shareholders: We are pleased to report to you that 2004 was another year of significantly improved performance by your Company. Our continued progress was in line with, and in some respects ahead of, the plan and milestones for success we established in 2001. Net customer sales grew by 9% in 2004 to $7.2 billion with gross profit up 19% and segment income(1) up 31% over last year. These results reflect strong unit sales volume, improving efficiencies and productivity and a dedication to quality and service to our customers. Since we announced the Company's plans for a turnaround in 2001, free cash flow(1) was established as a key metric which we would use to gauge our successes. Free cash flow for Crown is cash generated over and above day to day business needs and made available to pay down debt. With close attention to investment and spending we continued to generate significant free cash flow to delever the balance sheet and improve profit. At December 31, 2004, net debt of $3.4 billion was down approximately $1.5 billion from the end of 2001. For 2004, free cash flow was $266 million. The Company's share price increased 52% during 2004, and we presume that was, to some extent, a reflection of the market's confidence in the Company's ability to execute our plan. Division Performance Each of our operating divisions, the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific, recorded growth in sales, segment income and margin to net sales in 2004. While sales growth benefited from the strength of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, each operating division, excluding foreign currency translation, recorded organic sales growth over the prior year. Margin expansion was the result of strong unit sales volumes and increases in operational performance. In 2004, 70% of Company revenues were generated outside of the United States, reflecting the truly global nature of the business. Importantly, over 15% of 2004 sales revenue was derived from emerging or growing markets. With more than 40 modern plants across Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, China and Southeast Asia, your Company is well positioned to grow with the economic expansion and growth in consumer spending in these markets. Leveraging our existing operational platform presents exciting opportunities in the near future for your Company. Research and Development Activities Our industry leading research and development capability enabled us to bring more new products to market, which in turn helped our businesses throughout the world continue to show improvement in 2004. These innovations provided our customers with packaging solutions for brand building and enabled their products to stand out on the retail shelf while enhancing the consumers' ease of use. We have spoken to you in the past about the success of SuperEnd® , our

best-in-industry lightweight beverage can end. SuperEnd® has many advantages over other competing ends; but, the fact that it reduces metal usage by 10% became a significant growth driver in a world of rising raw material costs and increasing environmental concerns. During 2004, its success continued and at the end of 2004 more than 42 billion SuperEnd® can ends had been sold globally by Crown and its licensees. In addition, we have continued to achieve excellent results from our unique and patented can shaping technology in beverage, food, and aerosol applications. For those customers seeking to dramatically differentiate their products, fight commoditization and protect their brands from piracy abroad, we believe that our patented technology is the only practical and proven answer in the rigid metal packaging market. At the same time, we also have increased the number of sizes of beverage containers offered in every market in which we participate for brand building and differentiation. In our ever increasingly fast paced world, consumers are demanding that products become easier to use. One of Crown's solutions is its leading Lift-Off TM end technology which continued to grow in units sold and customer recognition. For example, in 2004 the Company expanded its offering of Peel SeamTM ends which combine a flexible, peelable, retortable end and a steel or aluminum rigid container. This is an exciting new package which enables our customers to launch new products and reposition existing products in the marketplace. The growth of this technology has been particularly strong within the European Division for a wide range of high value-added products. We believe that it will continue to grow, because our customers and consumers alike appreciate its easy opening convenience feature and the billboard effect of the printed Peel SeamTM end. Our world leading closure technology continues to gain momentum. In particular, we won a string of customer conversions to our Ideal® closure, a composite metal and plastic closure suitable for both glass and plastic containers. This closure, which is garnering increased attention in the marketplace, provides our customers with outstanding seal and product integrity characteristics, combined with an ease of opening that is unparalleled in the industry. Our Press Twist SuperPlusTM vacuum closure is a new innovation that is positioned to change the industry by mitigating food contact issues. There have been numerous other new product and new process innovations as well, all of which are focused on improving the capability of our customers to market their products more effectively.

In summary, we believe that 2004 marked the conclusion of the initial phase of our plan to strengthen and focus the Company's asset base, reduce debt, improve margins, increase return on investment, reduce costs and enhance product quality and customer service. As we mentioned at the outset, key financial indicators showed year on year progress, and we believe that 2005 has the opportunity for further advances. With product innovations, our presence in growth markets, maintaining a disciplined approach to capital investments and ongoing cost containment, we expect to achieve growth and margin enhancement throughout our product portfolio. We will continue to manage our packaging businesses in mature markets in a careful and measured way to generate free cash flow and to improve the return we earn on assets. At the same time, we believe that meaningful growth opportunities are available to the Company in our rapidly developing markets, such as China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Brazil. Our presence in these regions is the result of strategically selective investment decisions, followed up by very good execution which has created market positions, asset quality and management and personnel capabilities second to none. We will continue to aggressively pursue opportunities in these areas to produce above average returns for our shareholders. We must unfortunately report to you the passing in January of Fred DiBona, who served on our Board for only one year, but had a significant and positive effect as a consequence of his wise counsel, energy and steadfast support. We at Crown, and the community of the Greater Philadelphia area, lost a leader who will be sorely missed. In closing, we once again want to call to your attention the unflagging efforts of all of the Crown associates throughout the world. More than 27,000 men and women contributed to the Company's success in 2004 through their determination, commitment to excellence, high energy levels, and professionalism. We could not have done any of the things which have been accomplished without the widespread support of all, and we thank them all for their fine efforts.

Sincerely,

John W. Conway Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer March 11, 2005
