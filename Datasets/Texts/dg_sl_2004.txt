 To Our Shareholders,
As I write to you today, approaching my second anniversary with the Company, I continue to appreciate the enthusiasm of our associates and their commitment to our mission of Serving Others. In 2003, we began several key initiatives to improve our operating effectiveness and to better serve our customers. We made significant progress on those initia- tives in 2004 and still produced a successful financial performance for the year. Our financial position is strong, and we are dramatically improving our ability to compete. The need for our business model has never been stronger.
As you know, global economic forces collided in 2004 in a way that significantly affected U.S. consumers in general and those in the extreme value retail sector in particular. High unemployment among less educated workers, rising fuel costs and the ongoing war in Iraq meant more challenges for our core customers. In this environment, as our results reflect, Dollar General was able to differentiate itself from its competitors. We maintained the prices and quality our customers need, and we continued to attract new shoppers from a broader mix of the population, particularly higher income house- holds. We introduced our model into new territories in 2004 and again found appreciation for our business proposition of providing branded core products at low prices in conveniently located small stores.
We worked very hard in 2004 to manage the risks associated with external factors and with the challenges we faced as we began implementing our strategic plan. As a result of that hard work, we achieved strong results for the year. To recap:
• Total net sales grew 11.5% to $7.7 billion, while same-store sales increased 3.2%, one of the highest increases among our direct competitors.
• Earnings per share were $1.04, up 17% over 2003. Excluding the impact of a restatement-related penalty in 2003, earnings per share increased 13%.
• We opened 722 new stores, including 13 new Dollar General Markets. By fiscal year-end, we operated 7,320 stores in 30 states, including 15 Dollar General Markets.
• To support this store growth, we increased our total distribution center shipping capacity by 15%. In addition, we started construction on our eighth distribution center in South Carolina scheduled to begin operations in June 2005.
• We added coolers to over 4,300 stores, including all of our new stores so that, by the end of the year, 92% of our stores were selling refrigerated food items.
• We obtained food stamp (EBT) certification for over 6,300 stores, or 86% of our total network in 2004, allowing us to accept food stamps, an important ben- efit for our core customers.
• We completed the development phase of our store operations improvement proj- ect. By year-end, 350 pilot stores had been converted to the EZstore process.

In fiscal 2004, Dollar General paid cash dividends to shareholders of $53 million, or $0.16 per share, on an annual basis. During the year, the Company also repurchased approximately 11 million shares of its outstanding common stock for $209 million, including the remaining 10.5 million shares authorized under its 12 million share repurchase authorization that expired on March 13, 2005, and 0.5 million shares purchased under its new authorization to repurchase up to 10 million shares through November 2005.
Dollar General also recognized its role as corporate citizen. In 2004, we increased our corporate giving efforts and our focus on adult literacy. We also provided financial aid for the victims of the Asian tsunami and donated merchandise to aid in hurricane disaster relief in Florida. We were inspired by the amazing example set by our customers and employees who donated more than $2.5 million through our in-store Literacy Foundation cash cube program.
Dollar General employs over 60,000 people worldwide and human capital is and always will be our most important asset. The women and men who operate our Dollar General stores are the key to our Company’s continued growth and success. With that in mind, we have increased our efforts to recruit the right people for every position, particularly store manager. We are focused on improving selling skills and giving managers the operating tools they need. Over 60% of our store managers have completed an intensive training program at one of our 35 regional training centers. Partly as a result of these efforts, store manager turnover declined in 2004. Last year, we also demonstrated our commitment to promoting from within the Company. Approximately 52% of our 200 new district managers in 2004 were promotions from our stores reflecting our commitment to provide career advancement opportunities for those who perform and want to advance. We also remain committed to our diversity efforts to better reflect our entire customer base and to better understand every customer’s needs.
The Dollar General business model succeeds because we provide major national and international brand merchandise, as well as our own high quality private label products, at everyday low prices. Being in stock on this merchandise is a critical part of the model, so we devised an auto-replenishment system that was completely implemented by the end of the first quarter of 2004, nine months ahead of schedule. Our in-stock performance
improved significantly as a result. However, a by-product of the in-stock effort was a higher year-end inventory level. We will be focused on reducing per- store inventory levels in 2005 without negatively impacting in-stock levels.
We are committed to sourcing products with our customers in mind, scouring the world for unique values and reinventing the “treasure hunt” dimension of our merchandise mix. Our new Asian sourcing office became fully operational during 2004 and is contributing to our ability to bring new products at great prices to our customers. In addition, we stepped up our opportunistic purchas- ing efforts in 2004 to enhance our ability to respond to market opportunities. As we continue to expand geographically, we are working to become even better at segmenting our product mix for different needs.

                                                  We demand quality products and the right prices from our vendors, and we value our relationships with vendors who meet that demand. We will continue to develop these strong vendor relationships. As part of that effort, we are planning several projects with key vendors in 2005 to enhance their brands in our stores.

These new format stores are proving that we can become a primary destination for our core customers and that we can

of capital expenditures over the next two years in store and distribution center infrastructures to complete the implemen-

As I mentioned earlier, we expect to open our eighth distribution center later this year on time and on budget. We are planning to open a ninth distribution center in 2006.

While we are focused on these short-term initiatives and others, we are driven by our long-range strategic plan to achieve consistent financial growth year after year. That strategic plan was developed by your management team, in conjunction with your board of directors, in 2003 and updated in 2004. Even though Dollar General is the oldest and largest player in the dollar channel, we are still growing rapidly and do not ever take our place in the sector for granted. I am excited about the opportunities ahead. We have an established team that has demonstrated an ability to lead effectively. We also have a great business model, but we must continue to refine it to make it more productive and relevant to a broadening customer base.
In summary, our vision for the future of Dollar General has not changed. We will continue to differentiate ourselves on price and convenience, and we will continue to provide our customers unique assortments of quality branded products at low prices in conveniently located small stores.
I am truly honored to lead your Company, and I take that responsibility very seriously. Along with our team, I remain committed to growing shareholder value while serving the needs of our customers and employees. Thank you for your investment in Dollar General Corporation and your continued support.
Kindest regards,
David A. Perdue
