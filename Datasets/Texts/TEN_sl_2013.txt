One Bold Vision Early in the year, we made organizational changes to support our strategic direction and position Tenneco to achieve our vision for growth. We aligned our businesses along product lines by creating two global divisions, Clean Air and Ride Performance. This new structure creates a more focused approach for each product line, which allows us to capitalize on the strengths and opportunities unique to each while also beginning to drive greater integration across regions as we serve our global customer base.
Strategic Imperatives I am excited about the opportunities in both our Clean Air and Ride Performance businesses with each playing an important role in Tenneco’s future success. Our
Clean Air growth opportunities are regulatory driven due to societal concerns and the demand for clean air. We are winning new business and new customers as emissions regulations in markets worldwide continue to take effect on light vehicles, commercial trucks, off-highway equipment and large engine applications. These new opportunities include additional content to meet stricter regulations, incremental business as regulations expand across
a broader range of applications and opportunities in newly regulated regions.
OUR FULL SUITE OF AFTERTREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES MEETS THE WORLD’S TOUGHEST EMISSIONS REGULATIONS INCLUDING THE EPA
TIER 4 FINAL STANDARDS FOR OFF-HIGHWAY APPLICATIONS.
TENNECO’S STRATEGIC VISION PROVIDES A DISTINCT FOCUS FOR EACH OF OUR PRODUCT LINES, AND ALIGNS THE EFFORTS OF OUR 26,000 EMPLOYEES AROUND THE WORLD.

Our strategy focuses on having the global regulatory expertise, a solid foundation in core sciences and the technology and application engineering know-how needed to develop cost-effective solutions for a broad range of applications. Between now and 2025, we anticipate the global emissions control market will nearly triple in size and our goal is to capture a significant share of that growth.
In Ride Performance, our strength is reflected in the
89 million conventional shock absorbers and struts we produced in 2013, more than any other manufacturer worldwide. Our strategies leverage this significant scale and build on our leading market positions through product cost leadership, superior functionality and
with our advanced technology offerings. We anticipate realizing significant value as we continue to execute
on our product cost leadership plans, which include operational improvements applied across the production of those 89 million shocks and struts. We also have a tremendous opportunity with our electronic ride control components and systems. We’re broadening our customer base for these products, which deliver
superior driving experience using our most advanced ride control technologies.
Our Ride Performance business includes Tenneco’s global elastomer business with products sold under
the well-known CleviteTM Elastomers and AxiosTM brands. Our growth opportunities are in segments and applications that value high technology and full solutions, and in developing new uses for these products as part
of other Ride Performance and Clean Air solutions.
Tenneco also benefits from having a strong global aftermarket business. Strategically, our priority is to leverage our powerful brands, such as Monroe®, our distribution network and sales and marketing expertise to maintain Tenneco’s market-leading positions while also expanding into new geographic regions.
We have a solid base to build on with our shocks and struts, elastomer and aftermarket strengths and I am pleased with the plans we have in place to unlock the full potential of our Ride Performance business.

A Common Foundation Equally important to our success across the entire corporation is a common foundation of shared values, operational excellence and financial strength. These foundational elements enable us to meet our commitments to customers, employees and to our shareholders.
Shared Values Tenneco’s shared values capture the essence of who we are individually and collectively as a company. They define our behavior and the expectations we set for ourselves. At Tenneco, we place a great emphasis on our shared values, not only because working and living by these principles is the right thing to do, but I firmly believe they are the cornerstones of building and maintaining a strong and successful company.
Financial Strength Our 2013 financial results reflect the alignment of our global team around our growth opportunities and improvement initiatives as well as Tenneco’s outstanding balance across geographic regions, end-markets, customers and vehicle platforms. We delivered record high annual revenue of nearly $8 billion. Our global engineering and manufacturing footprint, advanced technology, and engineering capabilities continued to drive revenue growth in our light vehicle, commercial truck and off-highway equipment businesses. Light vehicle revenue rose eight percent year-over-year, outpacing global industry production. Commercial truck and off-highway business rose 18 percent for the year
as we benefitted from the continued ramp-up of new business to meet new emissions regulations, particularly in the North America and Europe off- highway markets. Complementing our original equipment revenue growth was a solid revenue contribution from our global aftermarket business.
In 2013, we also delivered record high earnings and cash flow with adjusted EBIT of $502 million and cash flow from operations of $503 million. We continue to

improve our balance sheet, which is stronger than ever as we achieved a new record low leverage ratio of 1.2x at the end of the year.
Our positive financial performance during 2013 sustains a pattern of profitable growth since the financial recession in 2008 and 2009, a trend we expect will continue. Our adjusted EBIT as a percent of value-add revenue increased to 8.2 percent, from 7.8 percent in 2012, driven by higher light vehicle volumes, an increase in commercial truck and off- highway revenues, higher global aftermarket sales and excellent operating performance.
Operational Excellence Operational excellence is
at the heart of everything we do. Tenneco’s focus on our global manufacturing performance and driving consistency across our operations drives not only our financial results but also customer satisfaction.
When it comes to our manufacturing performance, safety and quality are our top priorities and we improved in both areas in 2013. Our Total Case Rate safety metric improved to its lowest level ever as we continue our relentless efforts to make Tenneco an injury-free workplace — the only acceptable working environment and our unwavering goal.
Our quality performance last year was also outstanding, demonstrating Tenneco’s commitment to our customers’ success. We had a best-ever parts per million (PPM) quality metric of 13. PPM is a key metric used by our customers to rate our performance and help guide their decisions on new business awards.
I am also proud of our excellence in launching programs. In 2013, we successfully launched 185 platforms with 65 customers worldwide. Another measure of how well we are meeting our customers’ expectations is the customer awards we receive. During the year, many of our customers including General Motors, Ford, John Deere, Toyota and
Volvo recognized Tenneco for technology and innovation, quality and overall performance.

Another critical element to operational excellence
is optimizing our global footprint to ensure we are operating where our customers want us to be and as efficiently as possible. This is an ongoing effort in a dynamic world where capacity must be efficiently added in high growth regions and adjusted where market conditions dictate such as in Europe.
One Bold Vision — One Extraordinary Future There has never been a more exciting time to be a part of Tenneco. We have an opportunity to build an extraordinary future on the fundamental strengths within each of our core businesses. These strengths include: a diverse customer base, technological leadership, a global manufacturing and engineering footprint, and alignment around
the specific Clean Air and Ride Performance strategic imperatives. Underlying all of this is a strong culture grounded in our values. I speak for the entire global Tenneco team when I say that we have passion for this company; for turning our vision into reality; and for coming to work every day with enthusiasm, a desire to win and never losing sight of our commitment to serve our customers and to increase shareholder value.
I am proud of our 26,000 employees around the world who delivered excellent 2013 results and who are engaged in achieving our vision. I thank them for their efforts and I thank our shareholders, customers and suppliers for your confidence in Tenneco. I share that confidence and we are determined to build on everything we achieved in 2013.
Sincerely,
Gregg Sherrill
