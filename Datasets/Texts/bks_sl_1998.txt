This year's Annual Report is divided into two sections. The first is a description of our retail business along with our year-end financial results. The flip side of the report provides some information and color for our exciting and growing e-commerce enterprise, barnesandnoble.com. Although it is clear the World Wide Web, with its profound possibilities, will become a major component of the future of bookselling and publishing, we believe retail bookstores will remain the foundation of our industry. As the pictures of our new stores illustrate, shopping and browsing in a bookstore is an irreplaceable experience, and it is woven securely into the fabric of our American culture. At the same time, the Internet offers our customers yet another way to connect to Barnes & Noble. This has proved beyond dispute to increase the number of books purchased, simply because it provides the convenience of a great bookstore at the touch of a fingertip. More and more, we view barnesandnoble.com as the broadcast channel for the company, and the Barnes & Noble stores as the portal through which our e-commerce business will be nourished. And more and more, we are finding our good customers, especially avid book readers and collectors, buy books frequently across all channels of distribution. As you know, predicting the future is not so easy these days. If, as they say, an Internet year is equivalent to seven pre-Internet years, we would need to be looking 35 years into the future to do a five-year plan. Well, I'm not going to say I can see that far ahead (show me someone who can), but our shareholders and customers can be sure of one thing: The book on Barnes & Noble is only up to the second chapter!
