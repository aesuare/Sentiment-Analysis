MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY The Indian pharmaceutical market valued at Rs. 18126 crores has grown by 5.54% in the last twelve months (Source IMS MAT April, 2003). Anti-infectives, Alimentary tract and metabolism products constitute 47.5% of the total market. With increasing life expectancy the industry is gradually shifting towards old age therapies. The Pharmaceutical Industry is governed by the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO), 1995. The Government announced a new Drug Policy in March, 2002. However, the Drugs (Prices Control) Order based on the new policy has not been announced by the Government. The passing of the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2002 is one step closer towards complying with the WTO requirements of having product patents in place by January, 2005. FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE During the year ended 31st March, 2003, domestic pharma sales were Rs. 238.35 crores (Previous year Rs 237.70 crores). The proposal for implementation of VAT from 1st April, 2003 adversely affected the sales of the Company significantly in the last quarter as wholesalers were reluctant to hold tax paid stocks as at end 31st March, 2003. The Company continued to perform well in its core segments, such as Oral Contraceptives (OC), Hormone Therapy (HT), Antibiotics, Vaccines and Steroids. The Company maintains its leadership position in Hormone Therapy, Oral Contraceptives, Prednisolone and Folic Acid segments. Exports for the year at Rs. 27.41 crores are lower than previous year due to lower demand for Medrogestone. The business of erstwhile Geoffrey Manners & Co. Ltd., grew marginally by 0.42% to Rs. 31.29 crores during the year. Excluding the impact of Voluntary Retirement Scheme payments and reversal of contingency provision in the previous year, profit before tax is Rs. 61.81 crores as compared to Rs. 65.52 crores in the previous year. The lower profit in the current year is mainly due to the lower interest received following the deployment of surplus funds for the new solid dosage facility at Goa and the higher depreciation charge/utilities cost on the same. OPPORTUNITIES, THREATS, RISKS AND CONCERNS The Company continues to focus on its core products with dedicated sales force and sees good opportunities for its core products such as Antibiotics, Oral Contraceptives, Steroids and Vaccines. One of the biggest opportunities for the Company is access to the rich pipeline of new products available with Wyeth, USA. The Company has recently launched RAPAMUNETM, an immunosuppressant, for the prevention of organ rejection after transplantation which has been well accepted in the market. The Company continues to be adversely impacted by the launch of generic version of patented molecules by companies other than the patent holder. The claims under the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account and the comment of the Auditors regarding the amount payable into the Drugs Prices Equalisation Account have been explained at length in Note 5(a) to the Accounts. An early resolution of this issue will provide clarity for future planning.

OUTLOOK The Company sees a good future based on its current portfolio and new products launch programme. An early announcement of the Drugs (Prices Control) Order based on the new Drug Policy announced by the Government in 2002 will help in planning for the future. The Company also plans to introduce products in therapeutic areas such as Musculoskeletal and Vaccines in the pharmaceutical segment. The recent merger of Geoffrey Manners & Co. Ltd., provides the Company opportunities in the rapidly expanding OTC pharma market. The Company plans to launch new products in this segment also. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS The Company has adequate internal control systems with appropriate control checks. Effective measures are taken to ensure that all assets of the Company are protected and all transactions are recorded in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. The Internal Audit department regularly conducts review of the financial and operating controls in all areas of the Company's operations including transaction checks and significant issues, if any, are brought to the attention of the Audit Committee of the Board. HUMAN RESOURCES/INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS The Company continues to focus on its core values of Quality, Integrity, Leadership, Collaboration and Respect for people. Relations between the Company and the employees continue to be cordial at all locations. During the year, a settlement was signed with the Wyeth Employees Association, representing Head Office employees. Settlement with the Union representing a part of the Field Staff is under negotiation. The Company, as on 31st March, 2003, had 1798 employees on its rolls. During the year, 265 employees availed of the Voluntary Retirement Scheme as against 72 employees in the previous year. The information required under Section 217(2A) of the Companies Act, 1956 read with the Companies (Particulars of Employees) Rules, 1975 as amended is given in Annexure II to this Report. CAUTIONARY NOTE Certain statements in the Management Discussion and Analysis Section may be forward looking and are stated as required by the applicable laws and regulations. The future results of the Company may be affected by many factors, which could be different from what the Directors envisage in terms of future performance and outlook.
