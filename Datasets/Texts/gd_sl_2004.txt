Letter to the Shareholders

Dear Fellow Shareholder: I am pleased to report that the results of operations at General Dynamics in 2004 were superb. Revenues increased 17 percent to $19.2 billion and net earnings rose 22 percent to $1.2 billion. Cash generated from operating activities reached an all time high of $1.8 billion. This gave us $1.5 billion in free cash ­ after capital expenditures ­ to further strengthen our balance sheet. Overall backlog increased to $42.1 billion, up $1.5 billion from 2003. Not surprisingly, the stock market rewarded this performance with 2004 total return of 17.4 percent. Operationally, we experienced sales growth in each of our four business groups and margin improvement in three of the four. We successfully integrated several significant acquisitions, consolidated two businesses in our Information Systems and Technology group and enjoyed the benefit of the re-engineering of Gulfstream that occurred in 2003. Information Systems and Technology The Information Systems and Technology group was our largest source of sales and earnings, with revenues increasing almost 40 percent to $6.8 billion and operating earnings growing 33 percent to $715 million. Approximately one-half of the growth was the result of acquisitions in 2003 and 2004 and the other half organic. The organic growth reflects the continued demand by the U.S. and allied militaries for C4ISR systems (command, control, communications, computing, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance). Department of Defense funding for these programs remains robust as the military services accelerate the integration of C4ISR advanced technologies into current platforms and weapons. General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to benefit from this spending because many of our advanced communications and intelligence products are ready to be integrated quickly and effectively into the current force. We demonstrated our ability to capitalize on this growing C4ISR market with 15 significant program awards in 2004. As a result, backlog for the Information Systems and Technology group increased more than 25 percent in 2004 to $9.4 billion. This amount does not include an additional $6.3 billion in indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract awards that represent highly probable additional work. Combat Systems Our Combat Systems group also had an excellent year. Revenues rose 10 percent to $4.4 billion while operating earnings grew almost 18 percent to $522 million. This growth was built on the strong performance of a number of key programs, including the Stryker combat vehicle and the M1 Abrams tank, both of which have been successfully deployed by the U.S. Army in Iraq. Similarly, the U.S. Marine Corps has continued to rely on our family of Light Armored Vehicles (LAV) in their operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The U.S. military's increased need for ammunition and armaments also contributed to the growth. As a result of these activities, Combat Systems' backlog increased to a record $8.7 billion from $8.3 billion in 2003.

Combat Systems is well positioned to benefit from the increases in Army programs reflected in the President's FY 2006 budget and in the FY 2005 supplemental funding request for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our tank upgrade programs, replacement vehicles, ammunition and armaments continue to be needed by our deployed forces. Our European Land Combat Systems unit continued to grow through increased sales of Leopard tanks, Ulan infantry fighting vehicles and Piranha combat vehicles. Demand for combat vehicles worldwide is accelerating and we believe we are well positioned to participate. Marine Systems While still not meeting our expectations, the Marine Systems group's performance improved significantly in 2004. Revenues increased 11 percent to $4.7 billion, while operating income rose 35 percent to $292 million. Likewise, operating margins increased to 6.2 percent from 5.1 percent in 2003. This margin improvement reflects continued increases in efficiency at Bath Iron Works, good performance at Electric

Boat and a reduction in charges on a commercial shipbuilding project at NASSCO. The group's funded backlog increased to almost $10 billion in 2004 from $8.8 billion in 2003. Total backlog decreased to $16.8 billion from $18.2 billion ­ but improved again as a result of orders received this January. This backlog represents workload across our three shipyards into the next decade. Despite near-term reductions in the U.S. Navy's shipbuilding budget, this backlog provides us with a stable, long-term source of revenue. Moreover, as we continue to move down the learning curve at both Bath and NASSCO, we anticipate improved performance and profitability against this backlog. The Marine group passed several significant milestones in 2004 with the delivery at Electric Boat of the last ship in the Seawolf Class of nuclear-powered attack submarines, and the delivery of the first ship in the successor Virginia Class. In addition, Bath Iron Works delivered two Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers and NASSCO delivered the first of four state-of-the-art double-hull oil tankers.

4 General Dynamics 2004 Annual Report

Aerospace Gulfstream had a strong year in 2004. While revenue was up only modestly from 2003, the makeup of the revenue was important. New airplane volume was up $200 million and service revenue experienced a healthy $38 million increase, almost 10 percent higher than 2003. This was partially offset by a $179 million decrease in pre-owned aircraft volume, a low-margin activity. Earnings rose 80 percent to $393 million, with operating margins increasing to 13 percent from 7.4 percent in 2003, driven by continuing cost-reduction efforts and the initial impact of a firming price structure. Of particular note, Gulfstream received 95 orders, the largest number in its history if we exclude orders from fractional customers. As a result, we were 85 percent sold out of green aircraft delivery positions for 2005 at year-end, and had developed significant backlog for 2006 green deliveries. Looking Forward Our backlog is the largest in our history at $42 billion. Our company's domestic military markets remain strong

and growing for the foreseeable future. Internationally, our increased presence in Canada, the United Kingdom and continental Europe provides us opportunities to expand in defense markets around the globe. In addition, barring unforeseen shocks to the world economy, we expect the steady improvement in our business-jet markets, which began in the second half of 2003, to continue. In short, we are optimistic about our markets and the company's position as we look forward. As I conveyed to you last year, your management team will continue to focus on earnings, cash flow and return on invested capital as we execute current backlog and capture additional business. As we convert net earnings into free cash, we will deploy that cash where it generates the greatest value for our shareholders. Sincerely,
