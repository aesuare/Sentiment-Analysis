Executive Chairman of the Board
To Our Shareholders
In fiscal 2017, Atmos Energy continued our journey to making our safe utility and intrastate pipeline even safer. We invested over $1.1 billion with about 80 percent of the capital investment dedicated to safety and reliability projects. These investments not only improved the safety of our
8.1 percent
assets but also our financial
performance.
    640 miles
We replaced approximately 640 miles of aging natural gas distribution and trans- mission pipelines to make our system even safer and more reliable.
   Reported earnings per diluted share from continu- ing operations increased 8.1 percent, to $3.60 for fiscal 2017 marking our 15th consecutive annual increase. Net income for the fiscal year was $396 million, compared to $350 million in fiscal 2016.
We conducted 150,000 hours of safety and technical training in order to continue to provide safe and reliable service.
Our stock closed at $83.84 per share on September 29, 2017.
$1.80 per share
Dividends paid in fiscal 2017 were $1.80 per share. In November 2017, the board of directors continued our trend of consecutive annual dividend increases for the 34th consecutive year by raising the indicated rate by 7.8 percent for fiscal 2018 to $1.94 per share.
37,000 lines
We replaced more than 37,000 service lines.
210.5% return
Total shareholder return
in fiscal 2017 was 15.2 percent. Since we launched our growth through investment strategy in Oc- tober 2011, total return to our shareholders has been 210.5%.
150,000 hours
$83.84 per share
 During fiscal 2017, we paid $85 million to acquire a 140-mile natural gas pipeline to serve transportation customers in the rapidly growing North Texas market. We also completed the sale of our Atmos Energy Marketing business and became the largest publicly-traded, fully regulated natural gas company on the New York Stock Exchange.
Strengthening Relationships with Regulators and Customers
Replacing aging infrastructure requires a significant capital investment and partnering closely with regulators and customers to achieve balanced regulatory constructs.
We have approved mechanisms in all of our jurisdictions providing for the accelerated recovery of investments in safety.
Additionally, we have weather normalization mechanisms covering 97 percent of our customers, which help stabilize revenue fluctuations that could occur from weather which is warmer or colder than normal.
The monthly natural gas utility bill is either the lowest or one of the lowest monthly bills our customers receive. Customer bills have averaged less than $60 per month since 2007. We continue to project that the average monthly bill will remain a great value for at least the next decade.
Financial Results
Our distribution operations contributed $268 million, or 68% of our fiscal 2017 net income. Net income from our pipeline and storage operations was $114 million. During fiscal 2017,

  rate relief increased our gross profit by $97 million. Additionally, we benefited from net customer growth of one percent and increased transportation margins. The increased margins supported higher levels of pipeline maintenance and other integrity activities.
During the year, we completed 19 rate proceedings, which created an additional $104 million of rate adjustments during fiscal 2017. Our strong financial performance supported our ability to raise $975 million of debt and equity financing that we used to refinance maturing debt and to strengthen our financial profile. At September 30, 2017, our balance sheet had an equity-to-capital ratio of 52.6 percent, compared to 51.5 percent as of the fiscal 2016 year-end. $1.1 billion in net liquidity was on hand to meet anticipated financial needs.
Outlook
Our strategy is to make our system safer and invest in our existing assets rather than to acquire more utility properties. We own

more than 75,000 miles of distribution and transmission pipe- lines, and have 3.1 million service lines to customers’ premises. Our comprehensive infrastructure renewal and modern-
ization program allows us to replace cast iron, bare steel and early generation plastic pipe and replace or fortify older coated steel pipelines.
We have replaced nearly 1,200 miles of cast iron, bare steel and early-generation plastic pipe since 2011.
Our capital spending for fiscal 2018 is forecast to be between $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion. We expect our annual capital expenditures through fiscal 2022 will be about $1.3 billion to $1.9 billion. Our total rate base is expected to grow from approximately $6.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2017 to between $11.0 billion and $12.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2022 at a rate of between 10 percent and 12 percent.
Accordingly, we project that earnings per diluted share will increase at an annual growth rate of between 6 percent and 8 percent, with a total annual return to shareholders ranging between 8 percent to10 percent through fiscal 2022.

 Our Board has always made leadership development and executive succession planning one of its most salient priorities.
  Our guidance for earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2018 ranges between $3.75 and $3.95. Net income is forecast to be between $410 million and $440 million in fiscal 2018.
Leadership Update
In February, Dr. Thomas C. Meredith retired from the Company’s Board of Directors. Dr. Meredith joined the Board in 1995
and had chaired its Work Session/Annual Meeting Committee since 2010. He also served as a member of the Audit, Executive, Human Resources and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees during his tenure on the board. The Board benefited greatly from Dr. Meredith’s tremendous leadership, invaluable counsel and steady guidance for over 20 years during periods of significant change for our Company.
During this fiscal year we previously communicated the retirements or departures of some of our leadership team including Senior Vice Presidents Bret Eckert, Louis Gregory and Marvin Sweetin. Each provided distinguished service to our organization over many years and we thank them again for their leadership and contributions to our ongoing success.
In August the Board announced that effective October 1, 2017, Mike Haefner would be appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and that I would become Executive Chairman of the Board. The Board had planned for this succession for almost three years, initially appointing Mike as Executive Vice
President in January 2015 and then promoting him to Presi- dent and Chief Operating Officer on October 1, 2015. Mike joined Atmos Energy in 2008 as Senior Vice President of Human Resources after serving in leadership positions at Sabre Holdings, American Airlines and Eastman Kodak.
Our Board has always made leadership development and executive succession planning one of its most salient priorities. Mike is strategic, focused, astute, competitive, motivated and extremely employee-centric. He has built a strong manage- ment team and the Board has every confidence that the Company will continue to grow and thrive under Mike’s leadership.
Joining Mike as members of our management committee is an impressive group of leaders appointed by our Board who have risen through our ranks and held positions of increasing responsibility. They include:
• Kevin Akers, Senior Vice President of Safety and Enterprise Services
• Chris Forsythe, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
• Karen Hartsfield, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary
• David Park, Senior Vice President of Utility Operations
• Matt Robbins, Senior Vice President of Human Resources
With this change in senior leadership, Bob Best, who served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer from 1997 to October 1, 2010, and since as Chairman of the Board, will continue
to serve as a member of our Board of Directors. We are deeply indebted to Bob for his charismatic leadership, for leading the Company’s growth from 700,000 customers to over 3,000,000 customers and for coaching and mentoring most of the senior leaders in the Company. Bob created an employee focused, high performance culture and he will continue to be an important and instrumental part of the Company.
These leaders are supported by our 4,600 employees, who are committed to serving our customers exceptionally well while ensuring safety for themselves, their fellow employees and the people in the 1,400 communities we serve. For Atmos Energy, fiscal year 2017 marked another successful milepost on our journey to becoming the nation’s safest natural gas company.
