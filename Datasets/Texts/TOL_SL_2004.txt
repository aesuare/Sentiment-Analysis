Dear Shareholder
An Extraordinary Year With More To Come
Demand for our luxury homes remained tremendous in Fiscal Year (FY) 2004 and has continued through the early part of our FY 2005. With the most communities and most product lines we've ever offered, we produced records across the board. In FY 2004, net income grew by 57% to $409.1 million; revenues grew by 40% to $3.9 billion; new contracts grew by 62% to $5.6 billion; and shareholders' equity grew by 30% to $1.9 billion. Our revenues, contracts, and backlog increased in every region of the country. Investors took notice, as our stock price rose 74% from $36.84 per share at Fiscal Year End (FYE) 2003 to $64.00 per share as of this writing. And the beat goes on! Based on our excellent fourth quarter, we head into FY 2005 with strong momentum. Our fourth quarter-end backlog of $4.4 billion, our highest ever, was up 68% from one year ago. New contracts rose 51% to $1.5 billion, a fourth-quarter record. Fourth-quarter revenues rose 62% to $1.5 billion and fourth-quarter net income grew 93% to $180.6 million-- both were the highest totals in our history. With a backlog in place that is already 115% of FY 2004's home building revenues, we believe FY 2005's net income will increase at least 40% over FY 2004. Our community count, which hit a record 220 at FYE 2004, should reach about 240 by FYE 2005. With that expansion ahead, we think that in FY 2006 we will achieve net income growth of at least 20%.

Fundamentals Drive Demand
Why has demand for our luxury residences remained unabated and unsated? Because, over the past two decades, the supply of new housing in the U.S. has not kept pace with the growth in population and wealth. Since 1970, the U.S. population has increased by 85 million and, in the past two decades, households earning $100,000 or more have grown at a pace six times faster than U.S. households in general. Today there are 16.9 million households earning $100,000 or more: in constant 2003 dollars, that's 15% of U.S. households, compared to 6 million and 7% just 20 years ago. Much of the population growth has come from immigrants, who want to own the American Dream as soon as possible and arrive in the U.S. with the skills to achieve it. Logically, based on these demographics, more new housing should have been built. Yet, the home building industry has produced less new housing in the past decade than it did in the 1970s. Supply has been constrained by governmental regulation and no-growth politics, while demand has been spurred by increasing numbers of affluent households including maturing baby boomers entering their peak earning years: the result has been rising home prices and an appetite for luxury homes that we believe should remain strong in the foreseeable future.

Our Financial House Is Ready For Growth
Investment-grade ratings from Standard & Poor's (BBB-), Moody's (Baa3) and Fitch (BBB) enable us to raise capital at rates far below those available to the small private builders who are our main competitors in the luxury market. In FY 2004, we increased our revolving credit line from $575 million to $1.14 billion, expanded our bank group from 16 to 27 lenders, reduced our borrowing rate to Libor +70 basis points, and extended the facility's maturity by four years through July 2009. We also raised $300 million through a 4.95% ten-year senior note offering, a portion of which went to repay $170 million of 8 1/8% notes. At FYE 2004, our net debt to capital ratio* of 35% was our lowest since going public in 1986. The average maturity on our outstanding debt, 94% of which is locked in at fixed rates, was nearly seven years, which protects us from interest rate fluctuations. Our FYE 2004 shareholders' equity stood at over $1.9 billion and, as we write this, our market cap exceeds $4 billion.

Thanks To Our Team
Ours is an industry where success is achieved on the ground, one home at a time. By finding the right sites, by building homes with pride and care, and by striving to exceed the level of customer service that luxury buyers expect, we have made Toll Brothers the only national brand name in the luxury new home market. The accomplishments we have achieved and the goals we hope to achieve in the future are attributable to the determination, effort, creativity, initiative and spirit of the Toll Brothers associates. We thank our associates, our shareholders, our home buyers, our contractors and our suppliers for their support, trust and confidence in your Company.
Left to right:

For at least the past five or six years, it has been argued that a housing "bubble" has been created which is about to pop. We strongly disagree: we believe demand is being driven by fundamental demographics and home prices are rising due to the imbalance between supply and demand. In this increasingly lot-constrained environment, we think those builders with approved home sites in desirable locations will be the winners. With our strong land position, we have grown even in years when industry-wide housing production has slowed. And we continue to increase our holdings: this year we expanded our lot position to more than 60,000 home sites, an increase of 12,000 compared to FYE 2003.

Expanding The Brand By Staying Focused On Luxury
Our luxury brand continues to get stronger as demand accelerates. We have diversified into more markets and more product lines, which has increased our popularity and, therefore, our customer demand. We now offer move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, resort-style golf and lake communities, urban in-fill, high-density suburban, beach tower and, most recently, urban tower residences. Toll Brothers is the only national home building company focused primarily on the luxury market. Since going public in 1986, we have averaged more than 20% compound annual growth in net income, revenues, contracts, backlog and shareholders' equity. When there is strong demand, we benefit from exceptional pricing power because we have greater ability to raise prices than those builders who target buyers on tight budgets: it's easier to hit doubles, triples and home runs selling to luxury buyers. During tough economic times, affluent buyers are less impacted by a struggling economy, as our strong performance through the recent recession and stock market crash attests. And they are less affected by rising mortgage rates. In 1995 mortgage rates reached 9.2%; in 1996, 8.3%; in 1997, 8.2%; and in 2000, 8.6%. Our business was excellent during all of those periods. Today's comparable rates are about 5.75%. We believe it should be a long time before rates make a difference to our luxury home buyers.
