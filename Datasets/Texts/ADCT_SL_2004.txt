   DEAR FELLOW SHAREOWNERS,
After my first full year of serving as the President and Chief
Executive Officer of your company, I am pleased to have this
opportunity to discuss the significant progress that we made
during 2004 and to share our excitement about 2005 and
beyond. Fiscal 2004 was truly a turning point for ADC as we completed the repositioning of the company
to be more focused on our core competencies in key markets and to grow our revenues and profits as the communications industry begins to invest in new initiatives. This transformation included the acquisition of the KRONE Group as well as the divestiture of four nonstrategic business units. The “new” ADC is a leading global network infrastructure company, focused on connecting communications in every type of network — from within communications providers' operations centers through the “last mile/kilometer” to residential, business and mobile subscribers, and inside business enterprises and broadcast facilities. We now have a more focused company with opportunities to grow profitably around the globe through our leading product and service solutions, and strong customer relationships.
Robert E. (Bob) Switz
President and
Chief Executive Officer
RETURN TO GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY IN 2004
Fiscal 2004 was the first time since fiscal 2000 that ADC's annual sales grew and earnings from continuing operations were positive. This important milestone comes after four years of aggressive cost reductions, divestitures and restructuring in response to the dramatic downturn in our industry. For our continuing operations, fiscal 2004 sales of $784 million increased by 33% and earnings per share of $0.04 improved compared to a $0.06 loss in fiscal 2003. We believe that we are executing the right strategy of focusing on growth opportunities in our key customer segments. Our cash flow is another key indicator that we made the right choices on which businesses to divest and which businesses to build upon for long-term growth and profitability. In fiscal 2004, we generated $72 million of total cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations. By contrast, the four businesses that we divested in 2004 incurred $69 million of total cash used by operating activities from discontinued operations for
the same period.
THE NEW ADC
Our strategy calls for us to offer a broad range of infrastructure products and services that help our customers maximize their return on investment, evolve their networks, and simplify their network deployment challenges by offering high-quality, on-time and customer-specific solutions. During 2004, we enhanced this strategy with the acquisition of KRONE on May 18. By combining two of the world's leading brands in connectivity solutions, we created one company with global scale and presence. Your company now has:
• More than 3,000 customers worldwide, including nearly all of the top 100 largest communications service providers in the world.
• Approximately 60% of its sales coming from access infrastructure products for wireline, wireless, cable, and broadcast service providers, about 20% from business enterprise products and around 20% from professional services that help our customers plan, deploy and maintain their communications networks.

  • A greater global presence than ever before. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, approximately 52% of our sales were in the United States, about 30% in Europe and the balance spread throughout Canada, Latin America, Africa, and the Asia/Pacific regions.
2004 ACHIEVEMENTS IN GROWING ADC
Highlights of our achievements in growing ADC during 2004 included:
• Deployment of our OmniReachTM Fiber-to-the-X
products throughout North America as we take advantage of opportunities in this growing market segment. This supports telephone companies and municipalities that are building new networks to extend fiber closer to their subscribers for the delivery of a “triple-play” of high-speed Internet/data, video and voice services.
• Enhancement of TrueNet® — ADC's global structured cabling products — with the industry's broadest offering of data connectivity products for business enterprises and communications service providers, including the industry's most comprehensive end-to-end warranty that guarantees error-free performance over the TrueNet infrastructure.
• Successful global launch of our CopperTenTM system, the world's first structured copper cabling system that enables 10-Gigabit-per-second Ethernet transmission. Business enterprises are installing ADC's CopperTen system to ensure that their employees can economically send and receive larger image and data files at significantly faster speeds than ever before.
• Further acceptance of our Digivance® system at large wireless carriers because of its ability to improve capacity and spectral efficiency, as well as to increase the coverage footprint of our customers' wireless networks.
• Expansion of the customer base of our Professional Services business among wireline, wireless and cable network operators to help them deploy next-generation networks.
• Stabilization of our wireline transmission business and demonstrated dramatic improvements in profitability with an increased focus on capturing opportunities in optical, Ethernet and IP services in the business access market.
2005 OBJECTIVES
While we are pleased with our progress in fiscal 2004, we are driving hard to deliver even better sales growth and increased profitability in fiscal 2005. Our objectives include: • Achieving further revenue synergies and cost reductions
from the KRONE acquisition by selling our combined portfolio of ADC and KRONE products and services through our extensive global channels, leveraging our increased purchasing power and reducing redundant operating expenses around the world.
• Defending our core businesses where our products and services have sustainable competencies and scale, as well as historically demonstrated profitability.
• Working to obtain and maintain the number one or two positions in the markets we serve by selling more products and increasing market share.
• Creating new products with proven customer demand and sound economic returns.
• Entering new markets where we see attractive opportunities for growth and profits.
• Acquiring new products and entering adjacent markets when they enable economies of scale, satisfy our customers' needs, extend global presence, or expand channel influence in our core businesses.
ADC’s OUTLOOK FOR GROWTH
ADC's strategy has exciting potential for our long-term future. The primary growth drivers in our strategy are the evolution and transformation of wireline, wireless, cable, broadcast, and enterprise communications networks.
ADC offers a broad family of products and services to meet our customers' growing demands as the architecture and technologies in these networks migrate from circuit to packet, central office toward subscribers, and electrical to optical. The changes that are occurring in network architectures, equipment, service offerings, and bandwidth requirements create sales growth opportunities for ADC's products and services to connect the network components that deliver high-speed Internet/data, video, and voice services to our customers' subscribers. We believe that we have a sustainable leading position in global network infrastructure based on our proven track record of helping our customers achieve fast, high-quality delivery of communications services at lower costs.

  There are three significant trends underway in which we see growth opportunities for ADC. Accordingly, we are investing most of our research and development in these areas:
• Businesses and individual consumers are demanding more and more broadband services. In order for our customers — the communications service providers — to meet this demand, they must transform their networks to deliver cost effectively the "triple-play" of high-speed Internet/data, video and voice services to their subscribers. This trend is clearly visible in the actual and announced increases in spending on fiber-to-the-X network architectures by several large and small telephone companies, as well as many municipalities. These architectures extend fiber from the central office to local distribution points called "nodes" or to the curb outside existing homes and businesses, or all the way to subscribers’ premises. Based on our core competencies in connecting communications networks, our OmniReach Fiber-to-the-X products were developed and are being enhanced to meet our customers' needs in this expected high-growth and large market segment.
• The accelerating conversion of networks from circuit- switched to packet-based architectures. In order to implement this trend, service providers are increasing the use of Ethernet in communications service providers' operations centers and in business enterprises over Gigabit-speed lines. Our TrueNet and CopperTen products are examples of our innovations to meet this exciting growth opportunity for high-speed, cost-effective delivery of information to and from employees' work areas.
• The need for more wireless network capacity and improved coverage. Wireless carriers are struggling to keep up with the demand by their subscribers for more bandwidth and ubiquitous coverage. They are turning to new, cost-effective wireless architectures such as ADC's Digivance system, which we continue to enhance with further technological advances.
On an international basis, we believe there are great opportunities in emerging markets. India, China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and Russia are all very attractive growth markets for the future. Each presents unique challenges and opportunities, but all are markets that a global company must participate in for long-term growth.
In closing, there are many people to whom I am truly grateful for helping ADC succeed in 2004 and setting the stage for future growth. First, I would like to thank our customers for the opportunity to serve them and for their support of ADC's global network infrastructure strategy. We are committed to serving our customers well, understanding their needs and offering them valued solutions and services. Second, I thank our highly talented employees worldwide for their commitment to the "ADC Way" of customer focus, quality, innovation, teamwork, and integrity to build ADC into a leading global network infrastructure company connecting wireline, wireless, cable, broadcast, and enterprise communications. And to our shareowners, I thank you for your long-term patience and continued support as ADC transitioned in 2004 to a more focused company with exciting opportunities for long-term profitable growth. Finally, I thank the entire ADC board of directors for its guidance and support during ADC's transformational year.
On behalf of your board and ADC’s employees worldwide, I can assure you that we remain committed to again growing ADC for the benefit of all of our stakeholders.
