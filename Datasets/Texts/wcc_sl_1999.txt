 >dear shareholder
It is a great pleasure to provide WESCO’s first publicly issued Annual Review. This 1999 report covers a period of major accomplishments, increasing momentum and unparalleled corporate interest by our customers in procurement, distribution and logistics.
Watershed Year for WESCO International, Inc.
WESCO continued a six-year string of record annual sales and operating earnings that dates back to our separation, via a leveraged buyout, from Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1994. Sales growth of 13% and continued productivity gains led to an operating earnings increase of 16%. The compounded annual growth rates for sales and EBITDA for the past five years were 16% and 37%, respectively.
Early in 1999 we were added to the annual list of Fortune 500 companies, entering the list at 485 with a profitability ranking of 432. In May, WESCO completed its initial public offering and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “WCC.” The initial offering strengthened our financial position, increased awareness and visibility of our company and assured financing capacity for continued growth and expansion.

  Financial Results
Net sales for 1999 reached $3.4 billion, an increase over 1998 of $395 million or 13%. To put this into perspective, if a separate company generated $400 million in total sales, it would rank among the 15 largest electrical wholesale distributors in the United States. EBITDA increased to $145.3 million, up 18.5% or $22.7 million from the prior year. Net income, excluding the effects of a $10.5 million extraordi- nary charge associated with our refinancing, was $35.1 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.75. Return on invested capital was 15.1% and return on equity was 21%.
WESCO’s management and Board of Directors are confident in the value of our franchise and prospects for continued profitable growth. In late 1999, the Board authorized a $25 million share repurchase program. Through the end of February 2000, approximately two million shares had been acquired under this program. We believe that this program will create value for all of our shareholders.
Operating Strategy
WESCO has an extensive distribution infrastructure and an ability to deliver industrial, contractor and commercial project materials and supplies to virtually any local market in North America. Our large, technically oriented sales and service organization is deployed in local markets to provide dedicated personal attention and immediate response to customers’ product information, re-supply or special procurement needs.
We’ve developed a service approach that combines detailed customer familiarity and
high touch local attention with special information systems support and high levels of coordination for companies with multiple divisions or multiple locations. This effective combination of local and national support is a defining characteristic of our operating strategy, and a powerful differentiator between WESCO and other distributors. We initially applied this targeted national accounts marketing program to large, heavy industry manu- facturing firms. Over the last several years, we have been able to successfully apply similar marketing and sales support programs to other industries including utilities, financial institutions and telecommunications firms.

 Growth Opportunities
WESCO’s growth model consists of internally developed sales opportunities and growth through acquisition. Our sales organization is effective and highly productive, generating sales per employee 50% higher than the industry average. During 1999 we continued to push for higher productivity by investing in sales force and sales management training, and development of information systems tools that help target sales opportunities. We also continued the development of process methodologies that support and speed customer implementation and roll-out schedules for multi-site national accounts and integrated supply programs.
Throughout 1999 we added National Accounts sales personnel to cover new market segments including multi-site retailers, financial institutions, energy service companies and governmental agencies. This year we are continuing this sales force expansion to give increased coverage to the telecommunications industry and national electrical contracting firms.
Integrated Supply programs represent a high growth market for WESCO. In an integrated supply arrangement, WESCO assumes operational responsibility for electrical supplies and virtually all other categories of maintenance and operating supplies and services. We expect continued growth in this important service category as companies of all types are showing interest in improved procurement processes as a major cost savings opportunity.

The rapid development of e-commerce has raised the interest level in procurement and logistics to an all-time high. We’ve launched and staffed a new organizational unit to support e-commerce programs with existing customers and develop new markets through alliances and technology partnerships with leading trade exchanges and e-portals. The foundation for these new e-commerce partnerships consists of an expanded electronic catalog, Internet-based purchasing applications and fully integrated linkages to our order management and fulfillment capabilities.
Acquisition Growth
The continued expansion of our business base and geographical coverage through carefully targeted acquisitions remains a top priority. In 1999, WESCO completed the acquisition of four regional distributors in the northeast
and southern United States. These additions to our distribution network enhanced our position in serving key construction, industrial MRO and industrial OEM markets with electrical and automation products. Early in 2000, we further strengthened our factory automation and control capabilities through the acquisition of Control Corporation of America (CCA), a Virginia-based provider of engineered solutions for industrial automation systems.
Moving Forward
We will continue to invest in strategic growth initiatives, enhancement of our Integrated Supply platform, ongoing expansion of our National Accounts Marketing programs, advanced technologies to improve our services and ongoing acquisition and consolidation efforts.
With the support of our Board and shareholders, and the dedicated efforts of our employees, we look forward to a future of continued growth and profitability.
