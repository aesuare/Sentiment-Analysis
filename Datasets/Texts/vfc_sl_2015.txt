VF Corporation 2015 Annual Report

ERIC C. WISEMAN
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer

TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS:
2015 was a strong year for our company around the world. Through the first nine months of the year we tracked ahead of our targets with currency-neutral1 top-line growth of 9 percent, or 3 percent on a reported basis, and currency-neutral earnings per share up 15 percent, or 1 percent reported. Then the business environment changed and we took a more cautious approach to the balance of the year. Concerns around consumer shopping patterns accelerated during the fourth quarter, as we faced the warmest weather ever recorded during the period. We took immediate action to minimize the impact by managing inventories and reducing costs, while continuing to invest in our brands and innovation initiatives. Thanks to our team's grit, responsiveness and operational agility, we finished the year with results that we are proud of. Currency-neutral revenue was up 6 percent, or 1 percent on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings per share2 on a currency-neutral basis was up 12 percent, and was flat compared with adjusted earnings per share in 2014. Earnings per share on a reported basis was up 20 percent. Our full-year 2015 also faced comparisons against 2014's 53-week year. When normalized over 2014 and 2015, currency-neutral revenue grew 7 percent and earnings grew 13 percent annually over this period, in line with the targets of our five-year business plan. After the experience of 2015, I have a renewed sense of confidence and respect for our ability to drive future growth and shareholder returns.

While quarterly and annual assessments are important, there is value in measuring and assessing VF's longer-term performance. I'm pleased to report that VF's share price rose 350 percent during the period 2006-2015, compared with the S&P 500, which rose 64 percent during the same time. Moreover, VF's annualized total shareholder return during that 10-year period was 19.3 percent, compared with 7.3 percent for the S&P 500. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect the retail and currency environments to remain challenging, mostly in the first half of the year. We'll remain strategically and tactically focused on the things that will keep VF healthy for decades. This annual report defines our company: Powerful Brands. Powerful

30+

Platforms. One VF. Those six words ­ coupled with our consistent and proven commitment to growth, outstanding execution, strong cash generation and resulting total shareholder return ­ represent the sum of our parts. They symbolize our focus on growth and value creation. Our 30-plus brands are diverse, iconic and well-positioned to serve customers and consumers. They complement the vital role played by global VF teams that enable our performance, including the Direct-toConsumer, Global Business Technology, Human Resources, International, Supply Chain, Strategy and Innovation, and Sustainability and Responsibility organizations. Our One VF approach to business inspires associates to collaborate and share across the company to drive growth and create value. To sustain VF's performance, we will invest in our future, navigate the competitive landscape and succeed in an ever-changing environment by leveraging a growth strategy that fortifies our approach to winning. This strategy is not new. Its key elements remain the fundamental road map for VF's long-term journey: · LEAD IN INNOVATION by increasing our pipeline of compelling new products and technologies; · CONNECT WITH CONSUMERS by consistently engaging with them in new and meaningful ways; · SERVE CONSUMERS DIRECTLY, reaching them across multiple channels ­ wherever and whenever they shop; and, · EXPAND GEOGRAPHICALLY, taking full advantage of our scale within every region and channel in which we operate.

DIVERSE, ICONIC AND WELL-POSITIONED BRANDS TO SERVE CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS

VF Corporation 2015 Annual Report

Your Board of Directors has reviewed and approved that strategy and remains active in setting, monitoring and assessing our approach. The VF strategy and the many components that accompany it are the product of continuous collaboration. Within the brands, across coalitions and at the One VF level, executive teams meet often to ensure that we remain on track. Meaningful and time-tested indicators throughout our company provide early signs of favorable or unfavorable changes in the global marketplace. We are well-informed, nimble and fueled by our willingness to take an objective look in the mirror ­ and act quickly on what we see.

Thanks to our team's grit, responsiveness and operational agility, we finished the year with results that we are proud of.
A RESPONSIBLE APPROACH
Our executive compensation practices mitigate excessive risk-taking. Throughout the company, we emphasize pay-for-performance, using a balance of short- and long-term incentives based on a number of key performance metrics. We work to align executive compensation with shareholder returns through equity ownership and equity-based rewards. The practices we have in place help to ensure responsible compensation. For us, sustainability isn't just about doing what's right for people and the planet, it's also good business. Our Sustainability and Responsibility platform creates tangible value by serving as the catalyst for identifying new opportunities, reducing and managing risks, and lowering our costs. We view sustainable operations as a competitive advantage and an opportunity to help conserve the environment. We work to reduce our carbon footprint and increase energy efficiency; reduce our water consumption; and reduce, reuse and recycle materials. Two items of note: VF now has seven distribution centers designated as zero-waste facilities, and in 2015 we committed to using 100 percent renewable energy in all of our owned facilities by 2025. VF is one of the largest apparel and footwear companies in the world. With this scale comes the responsibility and opportunity to lead our industry toward a better future. To that end, we've created a Responsible Sourcing program, an initiative that ensures our contract suppliers are operating with the same high standards we set for ourselves.

03

The program has four objectives: 1) Maintain safe and healthy environments for all workers; 2) Manufacture products and source raw materials responsibly and ethically; 3) Reduce the environmental impact of our business; and 4) Improve the standard of living for all workers who make our products. In its earliest stages, this effort is already beginning to make a difference. As we move forward, I remain confident in our future, just as I am grateful to you, our shareholders, for your continued confidence ... to our customers and consumers worldwide for their loyalty ... and to our 64,000 associates whose passion and commitment enable our achievements.
