We were preparing for a 15% decline in sales by accelerating our three-year restructuring program, adding to it, and implementing measures across the company intended to preserve cash. Our goal was to exit 2009 and the recession as a fundamentally more profitable company, with restructuring behind us and sustained cash flow ahead of us."

Our short-term objective, set in the early months of the recession, was to enable the Company to be as profitable in 2010 as it was in 2008, even if sales were to remain well below 2008 levels. The strong results in Q4 2009 suggest that this objective has been met. Our long-term objective, which we set early in 2006, was to transform Albany from a North Americanand European-centric PMC company into a portfolio of cash flow and growth businesses. With a global PMC business positioned to generate substantial and sustained cash flow for the long term, a group of Applied Technologies businesses that tend to grow faster than the GNP while also generating cash, and an aerospace composites business with a unique technology position and exciting growth potential, that long-term objective has also been realized."

We’re also investing in voluntary (employee-paid) benefits where sales were up 20 percent in 2009.

While 2000 was a very good year, of greater significance is that the future looks bright. I have never been more confident in the future of the Company.

U.S. economic growth is still slow, hampered by lingering uncertainty about whether our political leaders can reach agreement on pressing fiscal issues. As a result of indecision in Washington, businesses are avoiding investments until they have a clearer picture about the economy and taxes – coupled with nervousness about higher regulatory and healthcare costs. Artificially low interest rates are constraining banks’ net interest margins, a key driver of profitability. Those concerns are compounded by the banking industry’s higher regulatory costs and intense competition."

In addition, we provide technology through the Pershing platform that services broker-dealers and financial advisors of all sizes who, in turn, offer capabilities to their end clients. We are among the world’s largest providers of clearing for institutions and services for financial advisors. And, increasingly, these technology platforms are being developed and used globally and far beyond traditional clearing and recordkeeping purposes. I say all this because, in Investment Services, we are a technology and services company embedded in a well-capitalized, extremely liquid, conservatively managed and highly rated bank. And our company is an institution that is integral to the smooth and continuous functioning of the world’s financial markets."

Our revenues are primarily fee-based with long-term contracts across much of our domestic crude oil business, which limits the impact to Buckeye of these volatile markets. There are certain aspects of our business that we expect to be negatively impacted by the recent decline in crude prices, such as our butane blending revenues and our settlement revenues, which are driven by the operation of our vapor recovery units. Offsetting these are several uplifts expected from the decline in crude prices. Contango market conditions, particularly in crude oil, are expected to drive improved rates on recontracting of segregated storage, primarily at our Global Marine Terminals segment as well as increased storage utilization across our system. In addition, we expect improved consumer demand for refined products driven by lower prices at the pump to translate into an increase in throughput revenues across our domestic system. Overall, we believe Buckeye’s diverse portfolio of assets will deliver stable cash flows and consistent financial results in the current market environment."

Our float has grown from $16 million in 1967, when we entered the business, to $62 billion at the end of 2009. Moreover, we have now operated at an underwriting profit for seven consecutive years. I believe it likely that we will continue to underwrite profitably in most – though certainly not all – future years. If we do so, our float will be cost-free, much as if someone deposited $62 billion with us that we could invest for our own benefit without the payment of interest."

Their fortunes may have been diminished by the disasters they oversaw, but they still live in grand style. It is the behavior of these CEOs and directors that needs to be changed: If their institutions and the country are harmed by their recklessness, they should pay a heavy price – one not reimbursable by the companies they’ve damaged nor by insurance. CEOs and, in many cases, directors have long benefitted from oversized financial carrots; some meaningful sticks now need to be part of their employment picture as well."

But for the purpose of estimating our current earning power, we are envisioning a year free of a mega-catastrophe in insurance and possessing a general business climate somewhat better than that of 2010 but weaker than that of 2005 or 2006. Using these assumptions, and several others that I will explain in the “Investment” section, I can estimate that the normal earning power of the assets we currently own is about $17 billion pre-tax and $12 billion after-tax, excluding any capital gains or losses. Every day Charlie and I think about how we can build on this base."

Yet he never exposes Berkshire to risks that are inappropriate in relation to our resources. Indeed, we are far more conservative than most large insurers in that respect.

cam_sl_1999-1,"In this letter last year, we discussed the need to manage our costs effectively, so as to ensure that we would comfortably survive any downturn in our business. We also said we needed to be mindful of being even better prepared to take advantage of the inevitable recovery when it arrived. We have done both"
cam_sl_1999-2,"At the beginning of 1999, our employment totaled approximately 9,300, down from a peak of nearly 10,400 in early 1998. Declining revenues, lower utilization and plant consolidations triggered additional reductions during the year, and nearly 1,000 people moved to Rolls-Royce plc as a result of the sale of our rotating compressor business. By the end of 1999, through layoffs, retirements, attrition and the sale, we had reduced staffing by more than twenty percent. Our employment level at year-end–approximately 7,200–was below that of the end of 1995, our first year as a public company"
cam_sl_1999-3,"CES’ transformation to meaningful profitability is by no means complete. There are still issues related to cost structure, product lines and aftermarket exposure that we will address in the coming months. The ongoing relocation of facilities under the terms of the agreement with Rolls-Royce is a significant part of that process, but should be completed by the end of this year."
cam_sl_1999-4,Protecting the intellectual property assets inherent in many of our proprietary core technologies and business methods is important to improving competitive position and product margins. The SpoolTreeTM Production System is one example of an innovative solution that became a Cameron patent and is now an accepted application for subsea completions. Licensing revenues from such technical innovations are expected to increase in coming years.
cam_sl_1999-5,"William C. Lemmer joined us in July as vice president, general counsel and secretary of Cooper Cameron Corporation, responsible for all legal matters with respect to Cooper Cameron and its subsidiaries. Bill previously held similar positions with Oryx Energy Company and with Sunoco, Inc. His diverse experience in the energy business makes him a valuable addition to our senior management team. Bill replaced Franklin Myers, who continued to serve as corporate general counsel even after he was named president of our Cooper Energy Services division in August 1998. Franklin’s full attention is now devoted to managing the day-to-day CES operations."
cam_sl_1999-6,"Much of that success will be driven by the apparent growth in worldwide deepwater development. Significant opportunities exist for our subsea business to rebuild backlog as new orders are placed for production equipment on large-scale offshore projects in areas like West Africa, Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico"
cam_sl_1999-7,"Plaudits about the importance of people to our business bear little credibility with those who have been downsized, outsourced or otherwise released from their jobs. But the harsh reality is that energy markets are inherently cyclical, and no company can avoid the need to constantly adjust employment—up or down—as the market dictates. The people who work for Cooper Cameron are among the best in their fields; we look forward to again dealing with the challenges of finding and adding more top performers, as opposed to the difficult task of reducing the workforce because a lack of activity demands it."
cam_sl_2004-1,"While proud of the progress cited above, we believe we can do even more to ensure that we deliver shareholder value more in keeping with our historical performance. We are as committed to that goal as we have ever been."
cam_sl_2004-10,"During 2003, we took a very conservative approach to managing our overall financial position as we assessed the opportunity to complete a significant acquisition. Later that year, when it was apparent that we would not complete the transaction, we repurchased a significant amount of our common stock. During 2004, we continued to redeploy cash through a mix of acquisitions and share repurchases. Today, our balance sheet remains one of the strongest in the industry"
cam_sl_2004-2,"On a related front, our ongoing share repurchase program has served us well to offset much of the dilutive impact from prior option grants. Since becoming a public company in 1995, we have less net debt; our market capitalization has increased sevenfold; and our share count has increased only seven percent."
cam_sl_2004-3,"Longer-term, we are encouraged about Cameron’s all-electric subsea production system, which was introduced to the market in early 2004. We have filed numerous U.S. and international patents on the system and believe it has the potential to be a game-changing technology advancement for the subsea markets."
cam_sl_2004-4,"With sales into nearly every energy-producing region in the world, oil markets also are a key driver for many of our operations. World demand for oil increased by just over three percent during 2004, driven primarily by a significant increase in China’s energy consumption. While global demand growth is expected to moderate in 2005 and 2006 to approximately 2.5 percent annually, the emergence of China as a major energy consumer will have a lasting effect on worldwide supply and demand for crude oil. U.S. oil demand was up about 2.2 percent in 2004, and is forecast to increase by approximately two percent in each of 2005 and 2006, with gasoline and jet fuel consumption driving the gains"
cam_sl_2004-5,"Cooper Cameron is keenly aware of the social, environmental and economic impacts the Company’s operations can have on the variety of locations where we do business"
cam_sl_2004-6,"Cooper Cameron has established itself as a good corporate citizen wherever we operate. We believe that our current policies and practices, across all of our business lines and global locations, provide effective guidelines for the Company’s approach to its role as a socially responsible corporate citizen. Cooper Cameron’s Standards of Conduct expressly address the Company’s commitment to ethics, integrity and maintaining its role as a good citizen in every country and community where we do business. Such guidelines include adhering to all local rules and regulations, providing a safe and healthy workplace with competitive wages and benefits and safeguarding the environment."
cam_sl_2004-7,"We have repeatedly won awards for our health and safety programs in a variety of locales, including Singapore and Leeds, England. The standards and practices that provide the foundation for such performance are an integral part of the training processes at our newer facilities, such as those in Nigeria, Angola and Equatorial Guinea, where we are establishing operations and relationships that will benefit our company and the local economies for years to come. While Cameron has operated for many years in Nigeria, where most members of the management team are local personnel, ouremployment in the West Africa region has doubled since 2001. Cameron is taking steps to ensure that the technical skills of the local workforce are consistent with those at other Cameron locations worldwide. The Company’s longer-term commitments in the region include sponsorship of a program in Angola where Cameron will foster the education of local students from age five through high school, and an ongoing community support program that will provide for the rehabilitation of local schools and make additional educational supplies available to teachers and students. "
cam_sl_2004-8,"Additionally, the Codes of Ethics for the Company’s senior officers and for the Company’s board of directors set out clear standards for proper behavior and appropriate disclosure of financial results. These documents are available in the Ethics & Governance section of the Company’s website at www.coopercameron.com."
cam_sl_2004-9,"We believe that the Company’s historical performance in its operations, the enhanced disclosure standards of recent years and the current emphasis on transparency in reporting financial and operating results serve to fully inform investors about the social, economic and environmental impacts of Cooper Cameron’s operations. Our board of directors regularly reviews the Company’s performance from a social responsibility perspective, and is committed to updating the Company’s procedures and practices when any need for changes or revisions is identified."

With our current outlook, projected sales and revenues should be close to $40 billion in 2006. That means we will have nearly doubled the size of our company in just three years, thanks to customers worldwide who have placed their trust and confidence in our products and services — and thanks to a global team of employees, dealers and suppliers who are working hand-in- hand to address the strong surge in customer demand. We’re in the midst of the most aggressive new product introduction campaign in our history and rapidly growing our service businesses. We’re making great gains in employee safety, engagement and diversity. And we’re laser-focused on reach- ing the 2010 targets in our new enterprise strategy."

These teams are generating significant improvements in our key focus areas of employee safety, product quality and product availability.

Cat® equipment, dealers and employees provided as much relief of human suffering as possible and today are helping people in the affected areas rebuild their lives."

We’ve made good progress the past few years, and the metrics in our new strategy will push us to improve even faster as we move toward our ultimate goal of zero injuries. Maintaining product quality standards also is critical. Quality is one of the reasons customers choose our equipment—it’s the hallmark of our reputation—but our quality levels have hit a plateau in recent years. To remain the market leader, we must make breakthrough improvements in product quality now. The same is true for product availability. We must improve our order-to- delivery processes so we can get our products to customers when they need them and faster than any competitor, all at lower costs and with less inventory tied up in our supply chain."

Finally, we will use our solid balance sheet to enhance our service offering for clients and to sustain our growth for the long term."
cbp_sl_2009-1,"Importantly, we achieved our financial goals while continuing to invest in innovation, infrastructure and our geographic footprint to accelerate our long-term growth. For example, we continued to make progress on sodium reduction, which increases the appeal of our soups as nourishing, simple meals. Nearly all of our North American operations successfully completed the transition to SAP, a more effective and efficient enterpriseresource planning system, which we plan to roll out to Australia and New Zealand during fiscal 2010. In our emerging markets business, we continued to advance our entries into Russia and China. In Russia, we greatly enhanced our distribution capabilities through an agreement with Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A., the distributor for Coca-Cola products in Russia. In China, we expanded into Shanghai, backed by continued investment in market research to ensure the strength of our consumer proposition. In addition, we expanded our Pepperidge Farm bakery capabilities by acquiring Ecce Panis, Inc., which gives us entry into the rapidly growing artisan breads segment."
cbp_sl_2009-10,"During fiscal 2009, in addition to making progress with our employees and consumers, we recruited a Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility to help drive our efforts in the community. We introduced Nourishing Our Neighbors, an enhanced community service program that brings together all of Campbell’s community activities, including the Campbell Soup Foundation and others, under one umbrella. We announced a five-year, $10 million charitable commitment to our hometown of Camden, N.J., and we laid the groundwork for our fiscal 2010 relaunch of Labels for Education, which focuses this school-support program specifically on art, academics and athletics. In sustainability, we continued to advance our packaging innovations and eco-efficiency projects at our manufacturing plants and in our logistics operations. We plan to publish our next CSR report later this fiscal year. We are setting destination goals in our four focus areas to provide a clear sense of our CSR business priorities for employees, customers and consumers.

cbp_sl_2009-5,"Last year, for the first time we achieved a world-class employee engagement ratio, which Gallup defines as a ratio of 12 engaged employees to every one actively disengaged employee. In this year’s survey, I am pleased to report that we nearly doubled our engagement to 23:1. Our engagement grand mean — the average of all responses to all 12 survey questions — places us in the 82nd percentile among the companies in Gallup’s global database. Now 70 percent of our work groups have achieved top-quartile engagement scores. Among our top 350 executives, the engagement ratio is at an all-time high of 77:1. This means for every 77 executives who are engaged in our efforts to build our business, only one executive is actively disengaged. As perspective, in 2001 the engagement ratio for these executives was 1:1, among the lowest Gallup had ever seen in a Fortune 500 company. Clearly we’ve come a long way"
cbp_sl_2009-6,"During fiscal 2009, we continued our efforts to foster a workplace environment in which people are valued, opinions count and leaders inspire trust. Our focus areas included diversity and inclusion, flexible work schedules and enhanced workplace safety. We also broke ground on our new employee services building at our World Headquarters in Camden, N.J. Our employees’ response to our workplace efforts has been inspiring, and we will continue working on this goal in fiscal 2010."
cbp_sl_2009-7,"We plan to build on our marketplace success in fiscal 2010. Innovations planned for the coming year include: • The restaging of Campbell’s Chunky soups, solving male consumers’ need for more nutritious ways to satisfy their appetites. • A lower-sodium Campbell’s Condensed Tomato soup, with the same great taste as always. • The introduction of Campbell’s Condensed Light soups, a great value alternative for weight-conscious consumers. • The launch of five new flavors of Campbell’s Select Harvest soups, inspired by healthy Mediterranean cooking. Also, now 12 Campbell’s Select Harvest soups are 100 percent natural. • The restaging of Campbell’s Healthy Request line, bringing lower sodium levels to Campbell’s Chunky, Select Harvest and Condensed soups. • The redesign of the Campbell’s Kitchen website with many simple meal suggestions under $10. • The introduction of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish Garden Cheddar crackers helping moms add vegetables to their kids’ favorite snacks. • The introduction in Belgium of Campbell’s Soup’ Maison, a high-quality, home-made style, shelf-stable soup. • A new distribution agreement in Russia, which will allow us to significantly expand the access to our products in this key emerging market"

The nearly 7,600 Celanese employees around the world make this success possible. It is an honor to work with them and to serve the stockholders as your Chairman and CEO. I appreciate your trust in me and our management team to continue to deliver strong results."
chk_sl_2003-1,"We have not forgotten, however, that Chesapeake’s stock price did decline in three of the past ten years. It was the disappointments of two of those years,1997 and 1998, a period of declining oil and gas prices and uneconomic Louisiana drilling results from a much smaller Chesapeake, that persuaded us to alter our strategy and concentrate on natural gas while pursuing greater scale, longer lived reserves, and a balance between drillbit growth and acquisition growth. This strategy, implemented in 1998 and executed consistently during the past six years, has served our shareholders well and we believe still provides the best game plan for continuing to deliver strong shareholder value performance in the years ahead."
chk_sl_2003-2,"One of the keys to consistently delivering great performance in the E&P industry is building scale in a limited number of core operating areas. Achieving economies of scale provides many important benefits, including higher per unit revenues, lower per unit costs, greater drilling success, better acquisition results, and higher returns on invested capital. Chesapeake first began pursuing regional scale in the Mid-Continent in 1998 and the success of our strategy has enabled the company to become the region’s largest natural gas producer, its most active driller and its most active acquirer of producing and non-producing properties."
chk_sl_2003-3,We hope the foregoing review of our business strategy helps explain how Chesapeake has been able to create industry-leading performance for our shareholders during our first 11 years as a public company.
chk_sl_2003-4,"As we conclude this letter and reflect on our performance during Chesapeake’s first 11 years, we remain optimistic about the continued success of the company and our ability to deliver value to our shareholders. We have built a strong foundation based on the commitment of 1,300 top-notch employees, a time-tested and successful business strategy, a value-added risk-management program, a steadily improving balance sheet and increasingly valuable natural gas assets. We also offer an entrepreneurial and experienced management team that has proven itself through a full range of commodity cycle challenges in building a $6.4 billion enterprise from an initial $50,000 investment in just 15 years"
chk_sl_2009-1,"Ironically, that is precisely what Chesapeake does today — uses its cutting-edge technological capabilities and industry-leading land acquisition skills to develop new unconventional reservoirs that have recently become some of the largest, most active and most highly valued natural gas development projects in the world."
chk_sl_2009-2,"Hard work, high-tech drilling rigs and gas-laden shale provide a formula for success. Employees of Nomac Drilling, a Chesapeake subsidiary, operate the largest rig fleet in the exploration and production industry as they drill for natural gas in America’s Big 6 shale plays."
chk_sl_2009-3,"We kicked off this “gas to oil” initiative two years ago, and to date, have already had initial success in 10 new oil plays. We also are working on additional oil play concepts. If these plays and concepts prove commercial on a large scale, then we believe Chesapeake owns more than four billion barrels of unrecognized oil resources that will substantially increase the company’s value as they are developed."
chk_sl_2009-4,The growing number of natural gaspowered electrical generation plants is testimony to their environmental and economic advantages.
chk_sl_2009-5,"Great assets would not and cannot exist without great people, so we take great pride in hiring, training, motivating, rewarding and retaining great people. From our beginning 20 years ago with 10 employees in Oklahoma to employing 8,600 people in 16 states today, Chesapeake has always focused on building a first class human resource team within a distinctive corporate culture. Talk to Chesapeake employees and you will sense genuine pride and great enthusiasm about the company and the vital role we play in delivering our high-quality product to consumers across the country."
chk_sl_2009-6,"In addition, we were honored in December 2009 at the 11th Annual Platts Global Energy Awards as the Energy Producer of the Year. We also received the Industry Leadership Award and were a finalist for CEO of the Year, Deal of the Year and Community Development Program of the Year. Chesapeake was one of only two companies to receive multiple awards this year and one of only three companies selected as a finalist in five or more categories. This was the second time in three years that Platts has named Chesapeake Producer of the Year. Chesapeake was also recognized in 2009 with Oil and Gas Investor magazine’s Best Corporate Citizen Award"
chk_sl_2009-7,"Chesapeake employees are distinctive in other ways as well. They are much younger than the industry average, with 50% of our 3,300 Oklahoma City-based headquarters employees 34 years old or younger. Their enthusiasm and willingness to learn create an atmosphere of vitality and energy at Chesapeake, important ingredients of our unique culture. These attributes, along with a very attractive corporate headquarters campus, low levels of bureaucracy and a well-executed corporate strategy, have combined to create our culture of success and innovation."
chk_sl_2009-8,"Because of a series of insights into the future, followed by good decisions and hard work, Chesapeake has grown from a small startup company 20 years ago into an industry leader today. Along the way, we have built the industry’s highest quality asset base in the Big 6 natural gas shale plays. These shale plays have dramatically changed how we can solve our nation’s most important energy and environmental challenges in the years ahead, while also creating millions of truly green jobs that pay well and do not need taxpayer or ratepayer subsidies. They also can improve America’s national security by reducing our dependence on foreign oil."
chk_sl_2009-9,"There has never really been any debate about whether natural gas is a good fuel — its carbon-light molecular structure guarantees that. The issue has always been whether there is enough of it to begin moving our electrical generation system more aggressively away from dirty coal and whether it is the right time to begin moving our transportation system away from expensive foreign oil. With the enormity of the Big 6 natural gas shale plays now more fully understood, it should become increasingly clear that the U.S. has a huge competitive advantage in the world."
chk_sl_2013-1,"We completed a major transformational initiative designed to drive greater value for our shareholders through profitable and sustainable growth. Chesapeake has an industry-leading portfolio of high-quality unconventional assets, and we are taking the necessary measures required to drive business results that reflect our asset quality. I am very proud of our team as we rapidly achieved significant improvements in financial and operational performance through our focus on value creation. Chesapeake is positioned for further competitive and profitable growth,  and we will relentlessly pursue our goal of becoming a top-performing E&P company."
chk_sl_2013-2,"Importantly, we launched a new company-wide core value system to guide our decisions and business practices. Our core values are the fabric that binds our employees together with a commitment to each other, our shareholders and other stakeholders as well as the environment.  We will conduct our business in the spirit of and with a focus on servant leadership, compliance and value creation. Our core values also serve as a guide by which we measure each other, and by which our stakeholders can measure the company and our success."
chrw_sl_2000-1,"Yet we measure our success in “being our best” beyond financial gains. In 2000, we added over 500 highly skilled and motivated employees to our talented workforce. We made faster-than-expected progress in our integration of Chicago Central (formerly American Backhaulers), the largest acquisition in our company’s history. We achieved our expectations for expanding our less-thantruckload (LTL) and short-haul truckload businesses – gains that we believe will pay off significantly in the future. We enhanced our load-optimization system, CHRuser, that will leverage CHRW’s huge network and streamline relationships between CHRW customers and carriers. Finally, and perhaps most significantly to readers of this report, we enjoyed a stock price rise of 58 percent and approved another dividend increase."
chrw_sl_2000-2,"In an era when companies in all industries are reinventing themselves to fit the perceived market need du jour, CHRW has achieved consistent success by adhering to our core principles: we’re a non-asset-based, peopleintensive service company focused on growth. With the emphasis we place on planning well, setting realistic but demanding goals, and maintaining our core identity, you could call us a purposeful growth company. Not flashy, but certainly successful."
chrw_sl_2000-3,"We continue to be impressed with the caliber and potential of our employees. Walk into any of our branch offices and you’ll immediately find employees consistently achieving success for themselves and for CHRW. As a means of rewarding and retaining our best performers, we enhanced our incentive-based compensation system last year to make it even more attractive and to additionally encourage employees to pursue profitable service-oriented business growth."
chrw_sl_2000-4,"Even with the success we’ve enjoyed as a public company, we take nothing for granted. We began 2001 the same way we start each year – hopeful and optimistic about our prospects, yet realizing that even with customers we’ve known for decades, we must work daily to earn their business. That, in sum, is what being our best is all about."
chrw_sl_2013-1,"IT WAS A CHALLENGING YEAR FOR C.H. ROBINSON. WHILE WE ACCOMPLISHED MANY OF OUR GOALS, WE FAILED TO GROW EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR 16 YEARS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY. WE ARE AS MOTIVATED AS EVER TO RETURN TO THE GROWTH OUTCOMES OUR SHAREHOLDERS EXPECT, AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO OUR SHORT AND LONG TERM INITIATIVES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH."
chrw_sl_2013-2,"We will continue to invest in our global services and network, with a focus on systems integration, cross selling, and network optimization of the Phoenix International business. In Europe, our expanded footprint will help us grow Global Forwarding and Surface Transportation revenues."
chrw_sl_2013-3,"Our employees, so critical to our successes and so central to all we aspire to do, diligently deliver exceptional value to customers and shareholders. Their efforts—combined with twelve years on the Best Place to Work list for large companies in the State of Minnesota and being named #1 on the list in 2013— attract the industry’s best talent. All this encourages job candidates to investigate the compelling career opportunities and professional development we offer."
chrw_sl_2013-4,"While 2013 was challenging, we remained committed to investing in our business for the long term benefit of customers, suppliers, employees, and shareholders. Our strategy—to grow market share, add new services, and expand and optimize our network—remain relevant and appropriate across our global business. We are confident that the talent and passion of over 11,000 employees will drive continued growth for many years to come. We have a strong history of adapting and evolving over the last 100-plus years, and with a flexible, variable cost business model and great culture, we will build an even stronger organization for our future. Thank you for believing in us and trusting our commitment to the long term priorities of our business."

While foresight and preparation made the century transition uneventful so far for most insurers, Cincinnati’s innovative stance showed our commitment to select courses of action consistent with our agents’ needs for stable markets and superior claims service. Like other insurers, we repaired or replaced our own non-compliant systems, and we went further by helping agencies assess their readiness. We helped them alert insured businesses of the need to prepare and staffed a hotline for Y2K-related insurance questions. Unlike many insurers, Cincinnati did not attach a Y2K-related exclusion to every policy in our commercial book of business. Instead, we chose to preserve traditional coverages for our policyholders, maintaining our practice of deciding coverage only after looking in each case at the specific loss and policy language."
cinf_sl_1999-2,"Cincinnati’s golden rule claims philosophy gives agents a competitive advantage. Nearly 700 field claims professionals work out of their homes in agents’ communities, available to provide emergency service 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Most policyholders learn to appreciate the value of insurance when they have a claim, so our claims representatives confirm that value by treating them as we would want to be treated."
cinf_sl_1999-3,"Just as agents and policyholders count on Cincinnati’s consistency and stability, you can count on consistently receiving shareholder value. In 1999, we returned more than $327 million to shareholders in cash dividends and stock repurchases. This was the 39th consecutive year of increased cash dividends. Dividends paid per share rose to $0.661 ⁄3 in 1999 from $0.21 in 1989, adjusted for stock dividends and splits. That’s a 12.2% compound growth rate for the past ten years."
cinf_sl_1999-4,"Director Emeritus Harry M.Turner, one of the four founding agents, also died in January. He wrote the first Cincinnati Insurance policy in 1951, served as its first president and chairman and Cincinnati Financial’s first chairman. He believed an agent-sponsored company that excelled at service and personal relationships would prosper. It did, and in 1999, we wrote the largest policy in our history. In the last days of December, a $302.9 million single-pay life policy on one bank’s officers put us over the top of our $2 billion goal for direct written premiums for property casualty and life insurance."
cinf_sl_2001-1,"When business historians talk about 2001, they will highlight fallout from two dramatic collapses, that of the twin towers in New York City on September 11 and that of giant energy trader Enron. These events raised serious questions about the physical and financial security of American citizens."
cinf_sl_2001-2,"Over the years, Cincinnati has been tagged as a company that thrives in a strong market for insurance – a hard market in the industry’s vernacular. We think that’s true, and we’ll be all right. Many positives are on our side. First and foremost, we do know how to underwrite, and for us that’s an activity that happens both in the field and at headquarters. Over the past two years, we became more aggressive about cleaning up the book of business and in 2001 improved results for some lines, notably commercial and personal auto. Agents, field representatives and underwriters are teaming up to gather facts and closely evaluate new and renewal risks. They aren’t afraid of the work that leads to sound risk selection, appropriate policy terms and conditions and accurate pricing for the risk exposure. They recognize that local knowledge and local decisionmaking are advantages we can leverage to stay a market for good accounts in most classes of business."
cinf_sl_2001-3,"We make accounting policies and reserving decisions with the intention of giving a conservative, true picture of your Company’s position. We feel strongly that our financial reporting should reflect not just the letter, but the spirit, of accounting policies and standards. When material bad news is on the horizon – such as the problems with the uninsured motorist line in 2000 – our strategy has been to deal with it openly and then move on. Faced with rising severity of losses, we opted to provide our constituents with more information, not less, shedding light on the issues and the solutions we pursued."
cinf_sl_2001-4,"A.M. Best Company affirmed the A++ Superior rating of Cincinnati’s property casualty companies based on superior capitalization, strong regional franchise, modest financial leverage and excellent cash flow. Fewer than 3 percent of insurer groups qualify at this level. Best affirmed Cincinnati Life’s A+ Superior rating and awarded a new aa Very Strong debt rating to Cincinnati Financial’s senior debentures."
cinf_sl_2001-5,"Named the leading commercial package insurer in survey results published by Crittenden’s Property Casualty Rates & Ratings newsletter (July 2001), Cincinnati writes approximately 80 percent to 85 percent of our commercial policies at annual premiums below $10,000. With reinsurance and terrorism coverage in place, we will have the flexibility to safely write the Main Street risks that are our primary appetite and to selectively write larger risks when our agents and their clients have special needs."
cinf_sl_2001-6,"Our talented associates and loyal agents are primed to do what has to be done and to do it better than ever. Staffing has increased 13 percent since the beginning of 2000, and training programs have greatly expanded for both Company and agency staff. The Company is developing and introducing technology to streamline back-office functions. The year 2001 brought the debut of CinciLink, an agency extranet that is the delivery platform for new and updated software including CinciPrint, which gives agents the convenience of retrieving and completing forms online."
cinf_sl_2001-7,"Imaging technology currently in use for selected business will be applied in additional areas during 2002, and agents in a pilot state will begin using an online personal policy processing system with functionality supporting a direct-bill option."
cinf_sl_2001-8,"Cincinnati Financial returned more than $182 million to shareholders in 2001, including cash dividends and common stock repurchases of more than 1 million shares at an average price of $37.67. Over the past 10 years, cash dividends paid per share rose to 82 cents from 27 cents, adjusted for stock dividends and splits. That’s a 10.2 percent compound growth rate for the 10-year period."
cinf_sl_2009-1,"The insurance business is not for the faint-hearted who are distracted or discouraged by near-term events and results. Pushing negativity of the first half into the background, our leaders and associates kept in the foreground the initiatives that would position your company to grow profitably in years to come. Our 2009 progress was significant."

cinf_sl_2009-3,Trimmed headquarters expenses by focusing on department level spending.
cinf_sl_2009-4,"This action also signaled our values of consistency, predictability and a long-term perspective – values that create steadiness in our management of market cycles, trust in our insurance relationships with agents and policyholders and transparency in our communications with investors. Those are values that have characterized your company since its founding in 1950 by four independent agents. We regretfully note the passing in early 2010 of our last living founder, Bob Schiff"
cinf_sl_2009-5,"The board has approved our enterprise strategic plan for 2010. They will measure our success executing the plan in several ways. The value creation ratio is our primary measure of progress. We believe it captures the contribution of our insurance operations, the success of our investment strategy and the importance we place on paying cash dividends to shareholders."
cinf_sl_2009-6,"Our 2010 plans and metrics fully support accountability of executives to the board and shareholders, of managers to department heads and of associates to supervisors. Additionally, shareholders approved the Annual Incentive Compensation Plan of 2009 at last year’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The board of directors recently adjusted the balance of compensation components for executive officers, implementing this plan that makes the vesting of awards contingent on attainment of specific company performance metrics. In turn, except in unusual circumstances, the executive officers no longer will receive nonperformance-based, discretionary bonuses that other associates continue to receive"
cinf_sl_2009-7,"Regardless of any economic upturn or market cycle changes that may or may not occur in 2010, we are confident in our ability to build on the improving trends and significant achievements of 2009. We thank our loyal shareholders for the opportunities to accomplish more for you in 2010."
cl_sl_2013-1,"Overall, we are very pleased with our results in 2013 and remain sharply focused on strengthening our fundamentals."

More than a thousand of my Citi colleagues have donated their time and expertise to the program, which has reached more than 70,000 out of our target of 100,000 young people across ten cities. Buoyed by the resonance of this effort, the Foundation began to expand Pathways to Progress internationally."

clgx_sl_2015-1,"Remarkably, our transformation into a global leader providing “must-have” data-driven property insights was achieved during a period of significant macro-economic pressures, regulatory uncertainty and market-specific headwinds in the U.S. housing and mortgage industries. Despite these external pressures, we invested to build high operating leverage in our core business units and foster technology leadership and innovation. We also improved our quality and service and achieved significant operating efficiencies. We largely self-funded these investments by developing a culture of continuous improvement and embedding a passion for driving operating emphasis on cost effectiveness and operating efficiency, and attention to cash flow management."
clgx_sl_2015-2,2016 presents a clear pathway to sustained growth. Realizing the CoreLogic vision requires that we constantly innovate and achieve market leadership and relevancy through scaled and data-enabled solutions. It is in this spirit that we launched the Valuation Solutions Group (VSG) in the fourth quarter of 2015. Over $4 billion is spent annually on residential property valuation in the U.S. alone. This area remains one of several underwriting and risk management activities in the property ecosystem that we believe would benefit from enhanced technology and the application of data and analytics
clgx_sl_2015-3,"I believe our consistently strong performance, in 2015 and over the past five years, demonstrates the benefits and value creation opportunities inherent in the CoreLogic strategic plan. CoreLogic is deeply embedded in our clients’ critical workflows. Our scale and ability to invest in the VSG and other unique solutions sets, compliance, automation and dataenabled services, as well as our reputation for delivering a high level of quality and service, have made us a preferred partner for businesses and government agencies with a need for property intelligence and risk management solutions. Our talented team members, who are now more than 6,000 strong, are dedicated to putting our clients first. By keeping clients top of mind in each action we take, we ensure their and our own success."

Centene’s strategy is clear, consistent, and effective — enter a state with a cost- effective solution, then look to build broader services within each market. We believe there is significant opportunity to further leverage this approach in the future. Going forward, our priorities include innovating in our approach to improve care for our members, expanding our geographic reach, and growing organically in our existing markets through Medicaid expansion and contracts for Medicaid/Medicare Dual-eligibles and Exchange- based solutions."

From 2011 to 2012, total premium and service revenue from our specialty business grew 71.9%. Early in 2013, we announced that we signed a definitive agreement to acquire AcariaHealth, a comprehensive specialty pharmacy company. Specialty pharmacy is a vital component in the overall health delivery model at Centene and will continue to grow as a percentage of our overall medical expense, particularly as it relates to the management of complex diseases in our higher acuity members. This strategic acquisition will enhance our suite of specialty services and improve how we manage conditions including Hepatitis C, Hemophilia, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis and Oncology.

We are also driving new uses: This year we unveiled our ARINC MultiLinkSM flight tracking service, offering airlines a comprehensive and cost-effective global flight tracking solution. And in February, Hong Kong Airlines turned to us to enable live credit card authorizations, significantly reducing the danger of credit card fraud."

cost_sl_2004-2,"As Costco’s founders, we take personal pride in the highly ethical way Costco conducts business—day in and day out. Throughout our 21 years in business, we have come to be viewed as the Company that has achieved unquestioned “pricing and value authority”—a position we have earned and that we value. We assure you that we will continue to work hard to maintain that reputation. Our priorities demand that we continue to delight our members every day. We want each shopping experience to be the best in terms of quality, value and service— and we want it to be fun. We strive to keep an undercurrent of excitement in our buildings, where our members can shop with the anticipation of finding unexpected treasures, while purchasing their everyday needs with the assurance they have received the best value—price and quality—available. This past year, we increased our staffing at the front-end registers, expediting the checkout process and enhancing our members’ overall shopping experience, leading, we believe, to more frequent shops and higher sales with minimal increases in expense."
cost_sl_2004-3,"We continue to look at other types of businesses that fit well within the Costco model. In fact, in October 2004 we opened our second Costco Home location adjacent to a high-volume Costco warehouse in Tempe, Arizona. Our first Costco Home, featuring high-end furniture and accessories, has been profitable since opening in December 2002, despite its “stand-alone” location in Kirkland, Washington. We feel the highly visible location of our new facility will draw additional traffic, thanks to its proximity to the Tempe warehouse, perhaps giving us a model to build on for future expansion of this business in markets where we have multiple Costco warehouses and hundreds of thousands of loyal Costco members. Our strategy, as we have mentioned before, is two-fold—first, make it more attractive to be a Costco member; and second, learn something in these businesses that will make all of our 449 Costcos better."
cost_sl_2004-4,"Our E-commerce business, at costco.com, continues to grow exponentially, and last year had sales of over $375 million, an increase of 66% over the prior year. As much as costco.com has grown, we believe we have barely touched the surface of this format, and forecast continued significant growth and leadership in the Ecommerce industry. Over the next several years we believe that costco.com, our “virtual warehouse,” can become a $5 billion business, helping us to leverage our existing relationships with suppliers, as well as expand our membership base."
cost_sl_2004-5,"As you know, we made changes to our health care plans that went into effect in October 2003—changes designed to bring a balance between rising health care costs and the need to educate our employees on how to be better health care consumers. Our new plans are expected to increase the percentage employees contribute from 4% to 8% over a four-year period. We have already seen a cost improvement in this area. Nevertheless, our employee benefits are still the best in our industry, and we will ensure that they remain so."
cost_sl_2004-6,"A big part of our success stems from our creative and cohesive management team, many of whom have been working together for more than 20 years at Costco, and for up to 40 years in retail. They are, we believe, the strongest team in the industry and are highly sought after. We are also aggressively developing new leaders within Costco’s employee base, and we have a new generation primed and ready to assume management roles as we expand our business."
cost_sl_2004-7,"In October of this year, we were pleased to add Susan Decker to our Board of Directors. Ms. Decker is the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration for Yahoo! Inc. Her breadth of experience—including 12 years in equity research and 4 years at Yahoo! Inc.—will be an asset to our Company, and we are fortunate and delighted to have her with Costco."
cost_sl_2004-8,"We’d like to thank our management team and our employees, all 110,000 of them, for their exceptional performance this past year. Their energy, dedication and ongoing efforts to continually exceed the expectations of our members, our suppliers and our communities ensure that as a company we are all doing our best for you, our shareholders."
cost_sl_2004-9,"The mettle of a great company is measured by its long-term performance, the quality of its organization, the integrity of its people and the attention paid to all of its stakeholders; as well as its ability to creatively rise above adversity. Together, we can be proud that Costco exemplifies such strengths, and that they can be seen in our 2004 achievements: record sales and profits, new cost-savings initiatives and reduced SG&A, expanded operations, creative merchandising, a loyal and growing membership base, a strengthened balance sheet, and a respected business reputation."

This includes tight scrutiny of products made outside the United States, particularly in light of recent incidents involving toys, certain health and beauty aids and other items. And we are not satisfied with high quality and safety alone. We make a concerted effort to consider the environmental impact and fair trade issues, among other considerations, in the growth, manufacture and packaging of the products we sell. For example, a new line of Kirkland Signature origin-specific, fair-trade coffee is grown with sustainable agricultural practices, while providing higher prices to the “source” farmers"

In recognition of their integral role in the success of our Company, Cognizant offers a dynamic workplace environment that encourages employee growth and advancement. The Cognizant Academy, our in-house corporate university, is an excellent example of this.

ctsh_sl_2001-4,"The Cognizant Academy is one of many reasons that we are considered an employer of choice in India, as rated by students at the leading universities, and increases our ability to attract exceptional people. Cognizant’s employees are the most satisfied employees in India’s competitive IT service industry – a factor that is crucial to a company’s overall performance – according to IDC India’s “Best Employer Survey”. Our Company also measures employee satisfaction in an annual survey conducted by the Hay Group – the most recent of which indicated that our employees, who have always expressed a very high level of overall satisfaction, are more satisfied with Cognizant than they have ever been before. High employee satisfaction not only helps us attract and retain India’s top IT talent, but also motivates our employees to deliver the type of outstanding service that results in Cognizant’s consistently high level of customer satisfaction. IDC India, which evaluated 150 Indian IT companies on 16 parameters, also concluded that Cognizant has the best facilities and resources, including connectivity, project development facilities and high bandwidth into customer systems. In addition, Cognizant has strong, established relationships with India’s top academic institutions, providing us with a reliable pipeline of superior IT talent, which allows us to respond to demand by ramping up our staff quickly with the best people.

cvgyq_sl_2009-1,"We have always believed that creating Energy-fromWaste (EfW) is universally valuable, that we are the best in this business, and that our long-term strategy for growth is sound. Nothing tests the soundness of these assertions quite like the volatile economic and political environment of the past few years. Bolstered by the stability of our base business and propelled by the judgment and dedication of our people, we fought against stiff economic headwinds to provide reliable service for our clients and solid financial results for our shareholders. And, far more than holding our own, we made significant progress on a number of fronts: we strengthened our balance sheet, deployed new technologies, completed strategic acquisitions, broke ground on new EfW capacity and gained traction on a robust growth pipeline—a pipeline that will propel us well into the next decade."
cvgyq_sl_2009-10,"Central to our environmental efforts is our Clean World Initiative (CWI). Established in late 2007, CWI is moving our company beyond compliance toward a more ambitious role of steadily reducing the environmental impact of our company and our industry. Our EfW facilities routinely achieve emission levels 60% to 70% below the established requirements of the U.S. EPA. Covanta has set a new industry standard for low NOx emissions with our LN™ technology, which has been installed at several facilities to successfully cut those emissions in half. Accomplishments of this magnitude serve to inspire us rather than satisfy us. We continue to explore further reduction of NOx and other emissions, and are in pursuit of entirely new innovations, such as turning waste into diesel fuel. It is in our nature to be intellectually curious about the possibility of building a better EfW mousetrap—and it serves our customers and shareholders as well."
cvgyq_sl_2009-11,"Though we cast our ambitions across a global spectrum, it is at the local level where we build and maintain the relationships that contribute to our success. Individual facilities conduct their own outreach endeavors, routinely offering educational facility tours, participating in community cleaning and greening activities, supporting local recycling programs, and participating in community boards, fundraisers, and other local community events. We know that fostering relationships at this level is the right thing to do and we are happy to give back in those places where our employees live and work. And, at the corporate level, we work on nurturing strategic partnerships with national environmental organizations such as the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and The Nature Conservancy, as we collectively fight to improve and protect the environment."
cvgyq_sl_2009-2,"Today EfW is widely recognized as carbon negative, a source of renewable energy and a means of waste disposal that is far superior to landfilling once the three R’s of reduce, reuse and recycle have been applied.  Policies in Europe are fostering growth, and support for similar policies is gaining traction in the United States. By way of telling our story, this year’s annual report explores all the things that trash can do. This theme captures the optimism and “can-do” spirit that drives Covanta on a daily basis."
cvgyq_sl_2009-3,"Covanta has made a significant investment of financial and human capital in Europe and the UK, and has made its mark as a serious participant in this EfW market. In December of 2009, we broke ground on a new facility in Dublin, Ireland with a capacity of up to 600,000 tonnes per year. This €350 million project being undertaken in partnership with the Dublin City Council (DCC) is scheduled to come on line in 2013 and will be owned, operated, and maintained by Covanta under a 25-year contract with DCC. By handling post-recycled waste, this facility perfectly complements Dublin’s recycling efforts and serves as a key component of an environmentally and economically sustainable waste management program. In short, it will be our marquee project in Europe, further establishing Covanta as the premier developer, builder, and operator of Energyfrom-Waste facilities."
cvgyq_sl_2009-4,"Support for boosting renewable energy production gained ground in the past year and Energy-from-Waste has been clearly identified as part of the solution in combination with high levels of recycling. The World Economic Forum recommends EfW as one of the ten large-scale technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions3 and the U.S. Council of Mayors also endorses EfW. In June 2009, the landmark WaxmanMarkey bill (the American Clean Energy and Security Act) passed in the U.S. House of Representatives. This ambitious legislation addresses renewable energy and climate change, recognizes EfW for its environmental benefits as renewable energy, and exempts EfW from carbon caps for the same reason. There is optimism now in many circles that renewable energy legislation will be passed by Congress this year. And, while climate change policy may or may not pass at the same time, we continue actively advocating for EfW to be recognized as part of the solution. In fact, Covanta made a compelling presentation in Copenhagen regarding the potential greenhouse gas reduction benefits of widespread adoption of comprehensive waste management policies, supporting recycling, EfW, and less landfilling. The potential benefit is enormous—on the order of magnitude of one gigaton of carbon reduction—the equivalent of shutting down nearly 1,000 large coal fired power plants. exempts EfW from cap and trade provisions as a net reducer of greenhouse gas. Senator Bingaman’s energy bill also defines EfW as renewable, and Senator Boxer’s climate bill also"

cvgyq_sl_2009-6,"We are in an enviable position; leading an industry that will help address three of the planet’s most pressing problems: environment, energy and the economy—and we have the financial strength and expertise to capitalize on this position to create shareholder value. Over the next five years, we will continue paying down existing project debt to strengthen our balance sheet, after which we will still generate approximately $200 million per year in cash for investment in a robust EfW development pipeline. This investment can be leveraged with project debt to achieve attractive returns on $2 to $3 billion in capital projects"
cvgyq_sl_2009-7,"Our number one resource at Covanta is our people. Recognizing that, we have always held safety as one of our core values. We were early adopters of various worker protection programs and in October of 2009, we introduced a new program we call STEP-UP, which stands for Safety Today and Everyday is Paramount— Unleash the Power. We are rolling out STEP-UP across our entire platform as an investment in our people and our business, and our goal is to have the most advanced safety culture anywhere."
cvgyq_sl_2009-8,"Our commitment to the OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) continues unabated, and in 2009 we added five facilities to close out the year at 32. Our goal is to have all of our domestic facilities obtain the coveted VPP Star."
cvgyq_sl_2009-9,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers Energy-from-Waste to be a “clean, reliable, renewable source of energy.”5 Year in and year out, our EfW facilities collectively operate for hundreds of thousands of hours, achieving environmental compliance at a rate of 99.9%. Some may view this as a job well done, but when we look at that figure, we see room for improvement. To our way of thinking, nothing short of total compliance is acceptable and we don’t stop there; we’re continuously working to further reduce our environmental footprint."

d_sl_2012-4,"In virginia, the $1.8 billion coal- and biomass-fired virginia city Hybrid energy center—which we believe to be one of the nation’s cleanest coal-burning power stations—began producing electricity for Dominion virginia power customers. Located in Southwest virginia, a region in which most counties have unemployment rates above 8 percent, the 600-megawatt facility has about 125 permanent employees onsite, and employed nearly 2,400 during the peak of construction. It is expected to contribute between $6 million and $7 million per year to wise county’s tax base. In addition, a major electric transmission project, Hayes to Yorktown, was energized. We invested $79 million in this electric transmission infrastructure, serving a high-load, constrained population center in the peninsula of virginia."
d_sl_2012-5,"Early in 2012, your company announced the availability of the eDge grid Side efficiency solution for utilities. The product, which enables utilities to deploy incremental grid-side energy management and voltage controls requiring no behavioral changes or purchases of equipment by end customers, is being marketed with Lockheed Martin, Elster, Landis+Gyr and Silver Spring networks. in December 2012, the Central Lincoln Utility People’s District, a leading Oregon utility, signed an agreement to use this voltage management software."
d_sl_2012-6,"Our industry, including our regulators and other watchdogs, needs to unite to lead the debate and get out in front before the next major disruption or rate spike occurs. If the goal is to maintain reliable electric service and stable rates, a national debate on energy is required."
d_sl_2012-7,"Among other items, energy policies must encourage fuel diversity in electric generation. For too long the government, through policies and regulations, has picked winners and losers. Said another way, policymakers have chosen which fuel sources are best for the country, sometimes ignoring market signals and other economic factors. The current winners include renewables and natural gas, to the detriment of nuclear and coal."
d_sl_2012-8,"In the mid-Atlantic, Northeast and Midwest alone, retirements of uneconomic or environmentally challenged coal units serving more than 5 million customers are expected to take place by 2016. And the nation’s 104 nuclear reactors likely will be decommissioned within the next 25 to 30 years, with very few on the drawing board to be replaced. If the nation were to replace these generating sources under current rules with only gas and renewables, that is the type of strategy that will lead to energy insecurity and, for American families, less stable and potentially debilitating rates."
d_sl_2012-9,"Energy is critical to all aspects of our economy and society. We would welcome a national policy discussion, starting with generation fuel diversity, with open arms."
de_sl_2012-1,"New products play a central role in our growth plans. Last year John Deere continued with a record introduction of products, most of which feature improvements in power, comfort and performance."
de_sl_2012-10,"Thanks to the tireless efforts of John Deere employees, dealers and suppliers everywhere, our plans for helping meet the world’s growing need for advanced equipment and solutions are moving ahead and meeting with success. All of which supports our confidence in the company’s present course and in our ability to deliver value to customers and investors in the years ahead."
de_sl_2012-2,"Recently introduced equipment includes a line of innovative round balers, a fuller line of versatile utility tractors, and a family of premium midsize tractors. Also debuting were recreational-utility vehicles that can reach a top speed of more than 50 miles an hour. New construction-equipment models were highlighted by the company’s largest-ever articulated dump truck, as well as backhoes, crawlers and excavators offering increased levels of performance."
de_sl_2012-3,"Long acclaimed for innovation, John Deere won further honors for its advanced products and technology. Among them were three awards from a top farm magazine, seven awards from a leading U.S. agricultural-engineering group, and seven received at a prominent farm show in Spain."
de_sl_2012-4,"Products recognized included S-series combines and various lines of large tractors. In addition, InformationWeek magazine named John Deere as the second most-innovative user of business technology among U.S. companies for its remote diagnostics software"
de_sl_2012-5,"Thousands of employees celebrated the company’s 175th anniversary through volunteer activities such as planting trees, remodeling schools and assisting local food banks. In this vein, employees enthusiastically embraced the company’s recently launched volunteerism initiative, recording more than 40,000 hours of volunteer service. To further encourage employees to give back, a program was introduced in the U.S. that makes cash grants available to charitable organizations at which individual employees devote at least a week of time annually."
de_sl_2012-6,"In addition, the John Deere Foundation partnered with organizations in India to help address the issue of poverty. A project in the city of Pune is helping raise living standards through improved access to services, income opportunities and shelter. Meanwhile, the foundation formalized an effort to assist subsistence farmers in northwest India. The Joint Initiative for Village Advancement (JIVA) focuses on making sustainable improvements in agriculture, education and infrastructure."
de_sl_2012-7,"In other actions, the company and foundation continued supporting education programs with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) activities."
de_sl_2012-8,Responsible citizenship also is reflected in our efforts to protect the well-being of employees. Safety is one of our highest priorities and the company’s exemplary safety record got even better in 2012. The rate of injuries causing time away from work reached a record low with more than half of our locations not reporting a single lost-time incident.
de_sl_2012-9,"In other milestones, Deere was listed among the world’s most-admired companies by Fortune magazine and named to prominent listings of most-ethical companies and leadingglobal brands. Additionally, the company was cited amongthe best places to work in Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Russiaand named a top employer in China by a leading university.These are important acknowledgments of our abilityto attract and develop top talent throughout the world.

In 2014, we partnered with our customers and vendors to donate nearly $17 million for charities, including $13 million toward the Dollar General Literacy Foundation, which helps to improve lives through literacy and education. Increasing literacy with an emphasis on adult literacy has been our focus, and we have helped millions of individuals take their first steps toward literacy or continued education since the Foundation’s inception in 1993."

dhi_sl_2006-1,"Our business model allows our people to excel, and our people are ultimately the difference between us and the rest of the industry. We are a team of thousands of diverse individuals working toward common goals we have set for ourselves. We treat each other as fellow members of the “Horton family,” and we have several key programs that promote this family culture, including our summer camp for employees’ children who wouldn’t otherwise have a summer vacation, our reservist support program for the families of employees called to active military service, natural disaster relief for extended family members of our employees and our Horton Family Homes program to provide affordable homes to employees who need help to realize home ownership. Our key managers are shareholders through direct stock ownership and participation in our stock option plans, and we encourage all of our employees to participate in our employee stock purchase plan. Our employees’ decisions are based on the long-term best interests of the Company because they are shareholders as well as entrepreneurs."
dhi_sl_2006-2,"We appreciate and thank our employees for all of their efforts this year. We also thank our thousands of suppliers and subcontractors, who are also part of our extended Horton family. The Horton team of employees, suppliers and subcontractors will be the driving force behind our future profitability and growth."

We want great people on the payroll.We strive to work together in the truest sense of the word “team.” And we play to win, not merely participate in our markets, for our customers and our shareholders. I’m proud and thankful for all our team did in 2004.They really are the best team around."
dhr_sl_2004-2,"I mentioned our 20th anniversary at the beginning of this letter. Everything we do at Danaher is geared to looking forward, not back (though DBS ensures that we learn from our mistakes). Still, every so often it’s rewarding to see how far we’ve come and how true our course 22 Shareholder Letter 2004 Annual Report has been. It’s also appropriate to honor the work of those who made our current opportunities possible. I know I have benefited immensely from what others have done before me — as have our customers and shareholders. I am incredibly proud of the dedication, professionalism and imagination of the 35,000 Danaher associates who continue to take the company to new levels of achievement every day"
dhr_sl_2011-1,Investing in innovation is a critical part of how we build businesses. We spent more than $1 billion on research and development (R&D) initiatives in 2011 with the goal of bringing innovative new products to market quickly to serve customers’ needs. Our customers benefited from a number of new product launches in 2011
dhr_sl_2011-2,"Quality has always been at the forefront of our DBS priorities and we will continue to focus on delivering reliable, high quality products to our customers.

dis_sl_2000-1,"Just as we are transforming the Disneyland Resort into a true multi-day tourist destination, this fall a similar transformation will take place on the other side of the Pacific. Tokyo Disneyland has regularly posted the highest attendance of all our theme parks. Now, we are putting the finishing touches on Tokyo DisneySea, adjacent to Tokyo Disneyland (www.tokyodisneysea.co.jp/english). This park will be totally original and totally breathtaking, thanks to the commitment of our partner, Oriental Land Company Ltd., whose investment is building the park. As with Tokyo Disneyland, our company will earn royalties from the day the park opens. In addition, we will receive royalties from two Disney-branded hotels — the Disney Ambassador, which opened in July across the street from Tokyo Disneyland, and the Disney MiraCosta, which will open at the same time as Tokyo DisneySea."
dis_sl_2000-2,"Quite frankly, our cast members are second to none. Working together, all of us plan to drive Disney to great new places in the months and years ahead."
dis_sl_2000-3,"In order to further strengthen our relationship with our most loyal customers, we have established The Disney Club, which offers a wide range of benefits across our company. Members will receive preferred access to select Disney theatrical performances such as The Lion King, AIDA, Beauty and the Beast, (still the #1, #2 and #3 shows on Broadway) and Disney on Ice; discounts and information about new products at Disney Store worldwide retail locations, catalog and online; and special offers on certain Disney videos, DVDs and CDs. Plus, members have access to offers and discounts from Disneyland and Walt Disney World. In the months and years ahead, it will only get better. For example, technology is being developed that could turn a Disney Club card into a “magic key” to the world of Disney. Imagine purchasing a Disney vacation package online, checking in to your hotel over the Internet or telephone before you leave home, and then using your membership card as your hotel room key and park admission pass! This may still be a few years away, but we’re already working on it. You can find out all the details about membership and benefits of The Disney Club at www.disneyclub.com."
dis_sl_2000-4,"There you have it. The corporate car is driving quite nicely, but we’re engineering it to perform even better in the days ahead. And it is important to make clear that a car, no matter how well engineered, is only as good as its drivers. I believe Disney’s management team has never been stronger. With Bob Iger and our Executive Committee, which is made up of our key corporate executives and the heads of our business units, we have an experienced group of individuals whose leadership skills span the breadth of this extraordinary company. Equally important are our 120,000 cast members, who ably carry the Disney and ABC and ESPN and Miramax and all of our other banners before the public. The dedication of thousands of our cast members was recognized in June by no less than General Colin Powell, who commended them for fulfilling their pledge of volunteering 1 million hours of community service by the end of 2000 … a pledge that I am proud to report has been exceeded as I write this letter."

We remain at the forefront of innovation that provides consumers with more control over what, when and where they watch TV. We were the first to provide digital video recorder functionality to satellite subscribers, and we have centered our efforts on enhancing our industry-leading DVRs. We recently introduced the DISH DVR Advantage Package, offering the best value in the industry, and during 2007, we expect to begin offering DVRs capable of storing up to 500 hours of programming, with the flexibility to further increase storage capacity by attaching external hard drives."

dltr_sl_2012-1,"Our merchandising model is powerful and flexible, and we use this strategy of ever-changing assortments to our advantage. Our assortments are planned to offer the greatest value to the customer for $1 and to do so at a cost that delivers our desired merchandise margin. To the customer, this means there is always something new at Dollar Tree. As customers strive to balance their budgets, they can find the high value basics they need while enjoying the “Thrill of the Hunt” on every visit. Seasonal assortments are fresh, colorful and fun, providing merchandise energy in the stores."
dltr_sl_2012-2,"We also plan to operate Better Stores. I am particularly pleased that average new store sales per square foot increased once again in 2012, to the highest level since 2001. New store productivity has now increased each year for seven consecutive years. This improvement has been a team effort."
dltr_sl_2012-3,"Our Board of Directors is active, involved, and committed to responsible corporate governance. The majority of the Board is comprised of independent directors; we have a lead independent director and all of the standing committees of the Board consist entirely of independent directors. The Board regularly reviews the Company’s governance practices and has made several changes in recent years. We maintain an open dialogue with shareholders on governance matters, and we continue to increase our understanding of industry standards in corporate governance as they evolve."

dltr_sl_2012-5,"None of our goals can be achieved without the collaborative efforts of our 81,000 dedicated associates, who are working hard to deliver value to our customers every day. They are the human element behind each sale. Every day, Dollar Tree Associates throughout the organization give of themselves to make sure that each customer is pleased with the shopping experience and that they leave the store with the intent to return and shop with us again and again. Their efforts and creativity are the keys to the Company’s success and growth. Dollar Tree’s success is measured by the success of our people."
dov_sl_2003-1,"Dover Technologies' turnaround was fueled in large part by the success of its CBAT (Circuit Board Assembly and Test) companies in selling equipment to rapidly expanding ODM (Original Design and Manufacture) and EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services) companies located in China. Universal Instruments, for example, was one of the first nonAsian companies to build a new CBAT assembly facility in China to serve local markets there, which now account for more than 40% of its sales. Universal has also established warehousing and global trading operations in Hong Kong and relocated tactical staff to Asia to enhance its capabilities in the region. Imaje, which has sold its inkjet marking equipment in Asia, including China since 1986, has also greatly expanded its product offerings and is maintaining its leadership in this strong and growing market."
dov_sl_2003-2,"Effective July 1, 2003, the Board of Directors appointed Ronald L. Hoffman President and Chief Operating Officer. He was formerly President and Chief Executive Officer of Dover Resources. David J. Ropp, formerly Executive Vice President of Dover Resources, has been named as the new President and CEO of Dover Resources. Ron Hoffman has a strong manufacturing background and proven leadership ability. In 1985, he led a management buyout of Tulsa Winch and expanded the company through acquisitions after it was purchased by Dover in 1996. He continued to run Tulsa Winch successfully until he was promoted to Executive Vice President and later President and CEO of Dover Resources."
dov_sl_2003-3,"There were a number of other management changes among Dover’s executive ranks in 2003. Lewis E. Burns, who had been with the company for many years, retired as President and CEO of Dover Industries at mid-year and was succeeded by Timothy J. Sandker, the former Executive Vice President of Dover Industries. New operating company presidents include Claus K. Lichtenberg at Alphasem (Technologies), Brian J. Kett at Triton Systems (Industries), Paul N. Brauss at Mark Andy (Diversified), and Michael G. Clute at Texas Hydraulics (Resources). These and other new appointments within our organization reflect our ability to develop the talent we need to continue growing and meeting the challenges that lie ahead"
dov_sl_2003-4,"We would like to close by commending our management teams and all of Dover's employees for their hard work and dedication during the difficult period from which we are now emerging.

dov_sl_2008,"The process of identifying and developing Dover leaders was historically informal. We are changing that and have made talent development a key area of focus. We are investing significant time and energy in initiatives which we believe will help develop leaders prepared to drive Dover to even greater success. Our Dover Executive Leadership and Leverage Academy (“DELLA”) is an internal training program designed to identify and educate our high potential managers and business executives. Since 2005, we’ve had 78 people graduate from the program, 22 of whom have been pro- moted to a more senior position, and four of whom have become operating company Presidents. Our DELLA program and other company supported educational and developmental activities, coupled with the recent hiring of Vice President of Human Resources, Jay Kloosterboer, underscores our commitment to superior business leadership development."

dow_sl_2002-1,"2002 was not a good year for Dow. Neither the general economy nor industry fundamentals offered much relief from the difficult conditions we faced in 2001. Despite expectations that industry conditions would improve in the second half of the year, the economic rebound never materialized, and lagging demand and excess capacity continued to impede our efforts to adequately raise prices and substantially increase volume. As a result, profit margins were severely compressed."
dow_sl_2002-2,"Meanwhile, we continue making progress towards our 2005 goals in Environmental, Health and Safety performance, and here it is worth mentioning that these ambitious goals represent an improvement of up to 90% from our starting point in 1994. During the year, we reduced our injury and illness rate by 20%, and leaks, breaks and spills by 14%. Lest we forget what these numbers mean, consider this: since 1994, more than 8000 injuries and illnesses did not occur as a result of our progress—in other words, Dow employees and contractors are safer."
dow_sl_2002-3,"And, in response to the corporate governance lapses that have shaken investor confidence, we are reaffirming and clarifying our code of ethics and strengthening the oversight of our company."
dow_sl_2002-4,"Towards that end, the well-known firm, Analysis, Research & Planning Corporation, with more than 20 years of experience working on major liability issues, including asbestos, quantified the potential cost of resolving pending and future claims against Carbide. Based on the results of this analysis, Carbide increased the reserve for its potential asbestos liabilities to $2.2 billion. It also increased the receivable for asbestos-related insurance recoveries to $1.35 billion."
dow_sl_2002-5,"Given the realities of geo-political uncertainty, industry overcapacity, and oil priced at more than $30 a barrel in early 2003, we do not expect industry conditions to substantially improve at least for the first quarter of 2003. But it is not our intention to simply wait for conditions to get better. Regardless of conditions, we intend to reach three key objectives in 2003: to improve our earnings, build our financial strength and work safely. To do so, we are concentrating on the things we can control: discretionary spending, capital expenditures, asset sales, asset shutdowns, customer focus, price-volume management, and workplace safety."
dow_sl_2006-1,"We also raised our dividend by 12% and repurchased more than 18 million shares, and our repurchase program is continuing. In October, we announced an additional $2 billion share buy-back program."
dow_sl_2006-2,"We launched our new Dow Water Solutions market-facing unit, which offers world-class brands and technologies to the water treatment industry. With Dow’s existing technologies and the July acquisition of Zhejiang Omex Environmental Engineering in China, this platform advances our capabilities in desalination, water purifi cation, contaminant removal and water recycling. We also started up a new plant in the United States for the production of FILMTECTM membranes, substantially increasing the production capacity of our reverse osmosis membranes used in water treatment."
dow_sl_2006-3,"In our Water Soluble Polymers business, we launched a new line of dietary fi ber products that help combat the problems of excessive blood glucose, cholesterol and insulin, as well as obesity. We also announced the planned acquisition of Bayer’s cellulosics business, which would increase the sales of our Water Soluble Polymers business by more than 60 percent to roughly $1 billion a year."
dow_sl_2006-4,"Part of that acceleration was our announcement, in January 2007, that we are launching two new market-facing units — one in coatings and the other in footwear. This business model creates a strong channel to market, customer focus, cost and product synergies, and opportunities to further develop competitive technology."
dow_sl_2006-5,"With companies as with individuals — especially companies as large and as well known as Dow — reputation is the sine qua non of success. If a company’s products don’t work, if its employees are treated unfairly, if its managers are not ethical, if its communities are ignored, trust is lost. And once lost, trust is diffi cult, if not impossible, to recover. So although reputation is not a hard asset per se, it may well be any company’s most critical asset."
dow_sl_2006-6,"As part of that effort, we completed our decade-long program to improve the safety of our plants and reduce our footprint on the environment. We also launched our new set of 2015 Sustainability Goals, committing our Company to the much broader responsibilities associated with the sustainability of our planet. In doing so, we pledged to address some of humanity’s most pressing problems: access to clean water, to shelter and to health care, and the critical issue of climate change, including the reduction of greenhouse gases. Toward that end, I made a public commitment at the United Nations’ headquarters in New York City that our Company would apply the full power of its technology — including three major breakthroughs during the 10 years of the program— as well as dedicate our philanthropy and volunteerism to help solve these and other challenges. And we invite everyone to chart our progress."

We have a shared identity, which is to be the best at what we do, and demonstrate that by winning in the marketplace, while also being a place where people can achieve their dreams.

We have a shared identity, which is to be the best at what we do, and demonstrate that by winning in the marketplace, while also being a place where people can achieve their dreams. And we have a strong set of shared values that speak to how we treat one another and how we treat people outside our organization."
dri_2012-2,"An important validation of the strength of our culture is the recognition we earned from FORTUNE magazine in 2011 and again in 2012 as one of the “100 Best Companies to Work For.” We are particularly proud because selection relies on an independently administered survey of employees – which, in our case, are largely hourly restaurant employees – and Darden is the first restaurant company to receive such recognition."

Over 90 percent of our restaurant General Managers and Managing Partners are promoted from our restaurant Manager ranks. With the new-restaurant growth we anticipate, this means that over the next five years more than 1,300 people will be promoted to the General Manager and Managing Partner levels internally. Similarly, approximately half of our restau- rant Managers are promoted from our hourly employee ranks, which means that over the next five years approximately 4,000 hourly employees will earn such promotions. As so many people continue to see Darden as a diverse and inclusive engine of opportunity, we are confident we can elicit from our workforce the kind of passionate commitment and discretionary effort that, ultimately, makes our brands and brand support platform as powerful as they are."

However, sales growth alone is not sufficient. We anticipate persistent upward pressure on our food costs, for example, driven by a sustained rise in global wealth, especially in emerging nations with large populations. We also expect persistent upward pressure on regulatory and compliance costs as increasing global transparency translates into rising expectations from the public and from non-public policymakers regarding how we conduct our business."

dri_2012-5,"Several more recent structural changes reflect the recognition that, with the tremendous day-to-day retail intensity of our business, we were not paying sufficient attention to major sales-building opportunities that have longer lead times. To take full advantage of these opportunities, in the past two years we have created enterprise-level Marketing and Restaurant Operations units and established forward-looking strategy units in our Finance and Information Technology functions. These teams have been resourced with talented leaders who have long tenure with the Company and with talented professionals new to the organization. Together, the teams are developing a more robust longer-term growth agenda to supplement the ongoing work of our brands. In fiscal 2013, we will be in the marketplace with two of the resulting initiatives – a greatly enhanced “To Go!” takeout operation at Olive Garden to respond to guests’ increasing need for convenience, and a national Spanish-language advertising campaign for Red Lobster to increase awareness among, and visits from, Hispanic and Latino consumers. We are excited about these efforts and about other aspects of the longer-term growth agenda that are now under development for deployment in fiscal 2014 and beyond."

Second, we believe our Company has what it takes to deliver on the opportunity before us. Our brands have strong individual and collective growth profiles. We have a wealth of collective experience and expertise. Our operating support platform is robust and ever more cost- effective. In addition, we have a vibrant culture that is marked by both an insatiable appetite to win in the marketplace and a burning desire to make a positive difference in the lives of our guests, employees, partners and neighbors."

Following a review of fiscal 2012, we summarize what that compelling value should look like over the next five years."

We call this new approach “Security Analytics,” as RSA employs Big Data tools and technologies to help customers defend networks, reduce fraud and manage risk. The ability to analyze all kinds of security data (both inside and outside an enterprise, in real time) is transformational. It enables systems to instantly recognize unusual characteristics in user behavior, whether on corporate networks or browsing consumer websites that may indicate cybercrime or fraud. Our 2012 acquisition of Silver Tail, which provides real-time web session intelligence and behavioral analysis, strengthens the RSA portfolio for today’s most urgent security challenges."
emn_sl_2012-1,"We look to the combination of our world-class technology platforms and our deep understanding of what our customers want as a main driver of growth for Eastman. By using our strong research and development capabilities to modify molecules and innovate new products, we are able to successfully collaborate with customers and benefit from long-term trends, such as energy efficiency and a growing middle class."
emn_sl_2012-2,"For example, new government regulatory requirements are driving the transportation industry to look for innovative materials to help improve fuel efficiency. Eastman tire additive technology can allow tire manufacturers to do this without compromising critical properties like handling and wet traction. Our acoustic and solar control technologies are also providing solutions in this market. For example, our Saflex® interlayer glass laminate helps reduce vehicle weight and increase fuel economy, as well as decrease cabin noise."
emn_sl_2012-3,"New product technologies like Eastman’s unique microfiber technology are also gaining momentum. Our core competency in polymer chemistry, world-class spinning capability, and inhouse application expertise are driving our fiber innovations, allowing customers to explore and expand a whole new dimension of opportunities in nonwoven and textile applications."
emn_sl_2012-4,"At the heart of our success is Eastman’s commitment to safety. In 2012, we launched our new safety initiative, ALL IN FOR SAFETY. This new campaign is a reminder to employees that safety isn’t something we should take for granted or become complacent about. Our safety record in 2012 was one of our best ever, with our recordable injury rate the lowest in our history. While we are proud of our safety record, we know that one injury is too many. That’s why our corporate goal is zero accidents or injuries. And we want this culture of safety to extend beyond the company walls into the homes of our employees."

In 2012, we pushed ourselves harder than ever, but in many ways, we feel like we are only getting started. All of us at Eastman are keenly aware that the work we are doing today is setting the course for our tomorrow. And we know that what we are doing matters not just to us but to the next generation of employees, customers, and owners. We will continue to build on this momentum and reward your confidence in us.

It also shows that we are capable of transforming adversity into an exhibition of why NU will continue to be successful in the future."

es_sl_2008-3,"For our communities, we continued to provide jobs by hiring over 500 new employees in 2008 and provided funding for various not-for-profit and civic organizations across our tri-state service area. For example, in Connecticut, CL&P donated $1.36 million in local grants and other support, while in New Hampshire, Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH) donated nearly $600,000 to the not-for-profit sector. In Massachusetts, Western Massachusetts Electric Company (WMECO) donated more than $480,000. Additionally, by purchasing $5.7 million in tax credits through the Connecticut LowIncome Housing Tax Program, CL&P helped fund housing for more than 500 families and individuals."
es_sl_2008-4,"For our shareholders, we delivered a better share price performance than most other utilities and other listed companies. In 2008, we continued to increase our dividend at a pace that is faster than the industry average, and in the first quarter of 2009, we further increased our dividend by 12 percent, at a time when many companies are cutting dividends. We believe these dividend increases underscore the confidence your Board and management have in the successful execution of our business strategy"

Demonstrating our commitment to the search for a portfolio of new solutions, late last year NU, joined by NSTAR, asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to approve our concept for a new participant-funded transmission line to connect to Hydro-Québec in eastern Canada."

Of course, that translates before all else into a determination to provide safe, reliable energy to our customers at a reasonable cost and always to be mindful that we must be stewards of our region’s environment."
es_sl_2008-9,"We strive to help the people of our region in other ways, too. Again in 2008, the Northeast Utilities Foundation donated $1 million to worthwhile regional activities, augmented by some $2.4 million in contributions made by our operating companies. And, as they did in 2007, our employees across our three-state territory donated more than $2 million themselves, while also volunteering their time and energy to help local organizations."

Kudos to all these offices for proving that our performance demonstrates just “how far our people will go,” no matter where in the world you deal with Expeditors."
expe_sl_2009-1,"We are certain that our products and services are now more compelling than they have ever been. As a public demonstration of the company’s efforts to put travelers first in every thinkable way, our flagship booking brand Expedia.com® recently rebranded itself with the tagline “Where you book matters™,” an assertion we strongly believe in, and on which our employees are dedicated to delivering every day."
expe_sl_2009-2,"Key to our international expansion efforts is our ability to expand the depth, breadth and quality of the product in our marketplace across air, hotel, car and other products. As a key example, we launched the Expedia Easy Manage program, our agency hotel model, in Europe in the spring of 2009. With our Easy Manage agency and Expedia Special Rate merchant models, we can now better address the varied business needs of our hotel partners and offer them the right framework within which to take advantage of Expedia’s global scope and scale. We now have over 40,000 merchant and agency hotel properties in Europe with direct Expedia contracts, and we expect to continue to significantly grow this supply base in 2010."
expe_sl_2009-3,"Though some may say that paying a dividend is a sign of slowing growth, it is actually a reflection of the confidence that we have in our business and especially our employee base. 2009 was a difficult year for our employees — we effected a huge reorganization, including a painful downsizing, we didn’t grant broad-based raises, and we reduced bonuses following poor 2008 results, all in the context of a deep worldwide recession. But our teams bore down and executed, and delivered a solid year. We are not where we want to be, but we have an organization with big dreams, a team that is passionate about our company and our industry, and the scale, global brands and technology to continue to lead the industry into the future."
f_sl_2003-1,"The biggest quality improvement of any of the five major automakers, with recall volumes reduced dramatically and warranty spending down 18 percent from 2002. We’re not where we want to be yet, but in the last two years our quality has improved by more than 16 percent"
f_sl_2003-2,"Our plans begin with great products, which have always been the foundation of success in our business. This year we are introducing 40 new products worldwide. By mid-decade we will have launched more than 150 new products, by far the most of any similar time period in our history"
f_sl_2003-3,"Consumer Driven 6-Sigma, our quality improvement and waste elimination methodology, has had an increasingly dramatic impact on our operations."
f_sl_2003-4,"The loyalty that people have to our company is another asset we want to fully leverage. In the latest R. L. Polk consumer loyalty study of new vehicles in North America we won 10 of 16 possible awards, including the Highest Overall Loyalty to Make award, which went to Ford Division."
f_sl_2003-5,"Being a family company, and not a faceless corporation, creates high expectations. We must deliver distinct products that offer quality, safety and value. We must treat our customers with honesty and respect. We have to be good neighbors in the communities where we do business. And I strongly believe we also must be outstanding citizens of the world, taking leadership on social and environmental issues related to the automotive industry"
f_sl_2003-6,"An area that will be critical to the success of these efforts is the environmental performance of our products. Later this year we will introduce Ford Escape Hybrid, a mainstream SUV with a full hybrid-electric powertrain. Escape Hybrid is designed to be the cleanest and most fuel-efficient SUV in the world. It is expected to achieve more than 35 miles per gallon in city driving, by far the best for any SUV, without compromising versatility or performance. We also will begin selling a fuel cell-powered version of the Ford Focus to commercial fleets later this year."
f_sl_2003-7,These products are part of an overall commitment to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gases and other emissions across our entire range of vehicles. Addressing air pollution and climate change issues effectively and transparently is a key element of our product development plans.
fir_sl_2004-1,"We also enjoyed another exceptional year in terms of our safety performance. This past year, the company’s lost workday case incidence rate was 52 times better than the U.S. construction industry average, evidence of our steadfast commitment to the well being of our global work force."
fir_sl_2004-2,"Contributing to this strong performance in Government was Fluor’s participation in the Iraq reconstruction effort, focused largely on the restoration of electrical power and water systems. This is important work, and we are proud to support the effort to improve the quality of life for the Iraqi people. Also, of primary importance, our security group has kept our valiant employees in Iraq out of harm’s way and allowed them to safely focus on their critical mission of rebuilding."
fir_sl_2004-3,"Through our participation in the World Economic Forum, our company is leading an effort to combat corruption in the conduct of international commerce, which Transparency International (TI) estimates equals a full three percent of the world’s gross domestic product. Corruption robs local populations in under-developed countries of critically needed resources, curbing economic growth. With the support of TI and the Basel Institute on Governance, the “Partnering Against Corruption Initiative” (PACI) now involves more than 60 corporations from the engineering & construction, energy and mining & metals industries, which have all committed to a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and the implementation or strengthening of internal controls to address this issue within their organizations. The momentum is building, and I believe the PACI will dramatically level the business playing field and spur economic development globally."
fir_sl_2004-4,"First, I want to congratulate and thank our employees for their outstanding contributions in making Fluor the premier engineering, procurement, construction and maintenance company in the world. I’m extremely proud of the passion they bring to work everyday for our clients, our shareholders and our communities. Their dedication to our guiding values of safety, integrity, teamwork and excellence is the foundation of our success."
fir_sl_2004-5,"I also would like to thank our Board of Directors for their valuable guidance and support throughout the year. At yearend, Dr. Martha Seger retired from our Board, after 13 years of dedicated service. As a financial economist and former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Martha brought a strong background in finance, economics and government, as well as extensive experience with the domestic and international banking communities."
fis_sl_2008-1,"We are proud to have achieved the goals that we outlined in the beginning of 2008 and are pleased with the consistently strong operating performance of our Company. The strategic investments and product initiatives that we have implemented over the past five years are producing tangible, measurable results. FIS is recognized as a global industry leader, and was named the number one banking technology provider in the world by American Banker and the research firm Financial Insights in the 2008 FinTech 100 rankings."
fitb_sl_2005-1,"We increased our sales force by nearly 1,400 positions in 2005. We still have work to do in reaching productivity goals for many of these additions, but I remain confident that a strong culture of sales measurement, accountability and performance-based rewards will drive future revenue growth."
fitb_sl_2005-2,"I have always believed, regardless of starting position, the bank with the best people will gain leading market share over time. Everything we do at Fifth Third is focused on identifying and rewarding top performers with the opportunity to drive results through our unique affiliate operating model. In recent years, as we have many times in the past, we experienced some change at both the affiliate and senior management levels. We thank these leaders for their efforts and honor their contributions by recommitting to the challenge of revenue growth and matching the work ethic for which this company has long been known. In each of our affiliates, we have experienced leaders working as a team to serve all of the customers in their market. Whether, like me, these leaders have been with Fifth Third for a very long time or have brought to our company many years of banking experience gained elsewhere, we all share a team orientation, a sales focus and a desire to serve our customers and shareholders. We remain committed to the challenge of driving revenue growth and capitalizing on the opportunities that lie ahead."
fitb_sl_2005-3,"Fifth Third has always operated under the premise that helping to build stronger communities will result in a stronger and more dynamic bank. Lending to build and revitalize neighborhoods, philanthropic giving and active community involvement are long-standing traditions at Fifth Third. I invite you to read about our most recent efforts on page 20 of this report."
fitb_sl_2005-4,"I would like to thank our customers, employees, board members and the communities in our 19 affiliates for their contributions and continued support. We have asked a great deal of our employees in 2005, and they have delivered. However, many challenges remain, and we still have a lot of work remaining to complete our shared vision of what Fifth Third can become."
gas_sl_2012-1,"We continued to advocate for a common sense energy policy that utilizes all available fuel sources–new nuclear, 21st century coal, natural gas, renewables and energy efficiency–and invests in energy innovation through research and development. We also emerged as a leading voice for the restoration of America’s financial integrity, and saw progress in this area with the passage of legislation preserving a rational approach for taxes on dividends and capital gains."
gas_sl_2012-2,"We continued to focus on improving the skill sets of our employees through a process of employee development and cross-training. Over the past two years, we have transferred some 700 employees across system lines, broadening their experience and better preparing them for the challenges that lie ahead. We also implemented a new online learning platform that further enhances our training capabilities"
gas_sl_2012-3,"Federal regulation of air and water issues will affect the financial strength of the customers and communities we serve, and therefore will require our active participation in this ongoing debate."
gas_sl_2012-4,"We will continue to argue for a common sense energy policy, and to be a champion for comprehensive tax reform and the rebuilding of America’s financial integrity. We will engage constructively with elected and appointed representatives at all levels of government to represent and protect the interests of the customers and communities we serve"
gas_sl_2012-5,"We will expand our use of Smart Energy, not just in terms of network devices such as smart meters, but also in terms of our generation fleet as it evolves to anticipate ever-changing conditions in the commodity markets."
gas_sl_2012-6,"We will continue to build a diverse workforce, one that is empowered by diverse experiences and diverse skill sets. We will be innovative in our thinking and disciplined in our methods. And in the end, we will succeed as much by the strength of our common character as by the substance of our collective accomplishments."
gco_sl_2010-1,"A large measure of our success during Fiscal 2010 is a reflection of the Company’s outstanding management team, whose talent, experience, and commitment are unparalleled. I salute the entire team, and am fortunate to have them as colleagues."
gco_sl_2010-2,"Finally, I want to recognize our retiring chairman, Hal Pennington. The current strength of Genesco, which has become even more evident in the past year, bears witness to Hal’s focus as CEO on improving the Company’s strategic position. Most important, Hal’s integrity and character and his commitment to Genesco throughout his more than 48 years with the Company have made him a model of leadership and have left a permanent imprint on Genesco’s special culture. I am honored to follow him as Genesco’s chairman and look forward to continuing to draw on his experience and insight in the year ahead."
ge_sl_1997-1,"Globalization is one of the engines of GE growth, now and well into the next century. There will be dislocations and speed bumps on the road to prosperity in all the world’s critical markets, but one cannot afford to write off any region in difficulty. Bad business management or bad government policies that weaken competitiveness can be remedied by tough restructuring and policy change."
ge_sl_1997-2,"Six Sigma project work consists of five basic activities: Defining, Measuring, Analyzing, Improving and then Controlling processes. These projects usually focus on improving our customers’ productivity and reducing their capital outlays, while increasing the quality, speed and efficiency of our operations."
ghc_sl_2014-1,"The end of this long list of transactions may be a good place to thank Hal Jones and his team. Through years of deals, Hal has provided a stream of good advice to me and the board. He has also worked impossibly hard. He and Wally Cooney have put together a terrific team, and their work has benefited shareholders a lot"
ghc_sl_2014-2,"The debate on economic inequality has highlighted the importance of a college education. American adults with college degrees consistently show higher incomes and a greater likelihood of employment. No one has said so more eloquently than the President and the First Lady, who continue to highlight the particular importance of college degrees to students from the lowest income families. The President has introduced programs to try to improve college attendance and college graduation."
ghc_sl_2014-3,"I first met Ann when she was a young Newsweek reporter covering the George H. W. Bush White House. She moved up slowly within Newsweek: she became Washington bureau chief, then managing editor. Since personal reasons kept Ann from moving to New York, the magazine’s home, she had gone as far as she could go there, and she listened to my offer to become our senior vice president in charge of human resources for the Company. She turned out to be great at it."
ghc_sl_2014-4,"But what great luck for our Company. We lean on our lawyers, and in Ronnie, we found someone whose advice was always excellent. She was Kaplan’s lawyer during countless deals; she became an operating executive for a while. She came to corporate in 2007 at my request. Here, she was invaluable during the times of turmoil in for-profit education and worked to ensure that Kaplan’s compliance process was strong. Ronnie worked ceaselessly and well through the blizzard of activity at WPO/GHC the past few years."
gis_sl_2005-1,"Dividends plus stock price appreciation in fiscal 2005 generated an 11 percent total return to General Mills shareholders. This return outpaced the S&P food index and the S&P 500, which both delivered returns of 9 percent. Over the most recent five-year period, returns to General Mills shareholders have averaged 7 percent annually, behind our peer group’s 10 percent average annual return, but well ahead of the overall market’s performance, which resulted in a negative1percent average annual return."
gis_sl_2005-2,"And we intend to return significant cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We expect dividends to grow over time as our earnings grow. We expect share repurchases to reduce total shares outstanding by a net 2 percent a year – not necessarily each and every year, but on average. As a result, we expect share repurchases to contribute to our EPS growth beginning in fiscal 2006."
gis_sl_2005-3,"In closing, I want to acknowledge the many important accomplishments and contributions of our 27,800 employees worldwide. Their talent and commitment give me confidence that General Mills will build on its record of delivering superior returns to shareholders in the years ahead."
gps_sl_2010,"The hard work of many people across Gap Inc. made these accomplishments possible. For that reason, on the following pages, I’ve asked a few of our leaders to help answer some questions that have come up in our conversations with shareholders."

gr_sl_2001-1,"Innovative new technologies like this are our lifeblood, and we look for ways to leverage them in aerospace and beyond. Our MEMS (Micro-ElectroMechanical Systems) technology is just one example. Our long-term agreement with Movaz Networks to use MEMS for optical switching opens a substantial new market opportunity. We expect applications for this technology to grow significantly over the next several years in both aerospace and non-aerospace markets."
gr_sl_2001-2,"Looking ahead, we have businesses that are performing well, and our fundamental strategies are intact: build on our aerospace base, target and create new global platforms, deliver on the promise of new products and technologies, and enter adjacent markets. We have executed these strategies well in the past, and you can expect to see more in the future."
gr_sl_2001-3,"To achieve all these objectives, we must attract and retain the right people. That’s why our efforts to create a high-performance organization are ongoing, with training, performance review and career development processes to develop our people for sustained success. Our succession planning processes also ensure we have the talent to meet our needs now and in the future."
hal_sl_2003-1,"We reorganized the ESG into four P&L divisions addressing four core customer needs. In addition, four new regional and 10 sub-regional organizations have been established, centered around natural geographic markets and aimed at further extending the ESG’s global growth. For the first time, we have broken out the ESG’s financials by divisions and regions to provide greater transparency to the financial community, and this move is being hailed by many analysts as a model for the industry"
hal_sl_2003-2,"Most of the major international oil companies have targeted clean-burning natural gas as a key area of their growth strategies. KBR continues to hold a leading market position in constructing plants for Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), and is responsible for building 56 percent of the world’s LNG capacity over the last 30 years. As worldwide demand for LNG continues to increase, more than doubling current levels by 2010, KBR will be right there, developing new technology, building on its know-how and delivering the projects that customers need."
hal_sl_2003-3,"KBR also has much to be proud of for the work it is doing in support of various military troops in locations across the globe. KBR was recently awarded a contract by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to support military operations, federal agencies and governments throughout the U.S. Central Command’s 25-country region that extends from the Horn of Africa to Central Asia."
hal_sl_2003-4,"Our commitment to Service Quality, along with Health, Safety and Environment (HSE), is eliminating health, safety and environmental incidents at the job site, as well as the waste of precious resources and capital. The technologies we’ve developed are helping customers develop their assets in less time for lower costs and with fewer risks. We’re participating with many of our customers and host governments to create global solutions to energy problems. Recently, we posted a representative to a two-year assignment with the World Bank to work on the Global Gas Flaring Reduction team and to help it develop alternatives for harmful gas flaring practices, encouraging the use of saved gas as a cheap and clean fuel for local communities."
hal_sl_2003-5,"Since the earliest times, a long and prosperous future has been the hope of almost everyone on this planet. The secret of longevity is one of humankind’s greatest quests. Building a Sustainable Future is a process that requires everyone in the organization working together to improve efficiencies. It requires our will and the courage to adapt to an ever-changing and challenging future by understanding and responding to the needs of customers in diverse markets; by identifying and exploiting opportunities without succumbing to market volatility and risk; by committing to continuous innovation; and by understanding that a company thrives not just by capturing markets, but by developing its people."
hal_sl_2006-1,"Among the new technologies we have applied to the Canadian market are Sperry’s StrataSteer® 3DTM system, which was recognized by World Oil magazine as the Best Data Visualization Package, and our patented Geo-Pilot® rotary steerable system. The StrataSteer 3D system, coupled with our real-time decision-making capabilities, gives us a decided edge in in-situ heavy oil development, a high-growth sector."
hal_sl_2006-2,"Another emerging technology is Baroid’s new diesel-based drilling fluid called Integrade™. It is based on our ACCOLADE® technology, which helps lower overall well construction costs by increasing penetration rates. We saw a 90-percent increase in the number of Integrade jobs performed in the fourth quarter of 2006 in deep U.S. well applications."
hal_sl_2006-3,"Our employees are to be commended for their outstanding performance, attention to safety and service quality, and dedication to the success of our company, as well as for their service to their communities and goodwill toward their neighbors."
has_sl_2008-1,"In 2008, we launched nearly 30 games across console, handheld, mobile, iPod, iPhone and online platforms. LITTLESTPET SHOP, NERF, MONOPOLY, SCRABBLE, SORRY, YAHTZEE and other great Hasbro brands found new life at thefi ngertips of our consumers. In 2009, our partnership with EA is expected to deliver more games across more platformsthan in 2008, with new games based on Hasbro brands, including LITTLEST PET SHOP, SCRABBLE, TRIVIAL PURSUIT,and CRANIUM."
has_sl_2008-2,"Our 2008 accomplishments highlight the success of the team’s execution of our strategy, a strategy fi rst envisioned in2001 with the decision to focus on Hasbro core brands. This decision is one Al Verrecchia, now Chairman of Hasbro’sBoard of Directors, is intimately familiar with. In 2008, after a highly successful run as Hasbro’s President and ChiefExecutive Offi cer, Al retired from his day to day role at Hasbro. Al’s dedication to Hasbro’s long-term success andhis commitment to develop strong leadership across the organization enabled a seamless transition not only for thePresident and Chief Executive Offi cer role but also for the Chief Operating Offi cer role, which David Hargreaves added tohis existing role as Chief Financial Offi cer. Al has long provided tremendous guidance to Hasbro and as Chairman willcontinue to bring his industry knowledge and expertise to our Board"
has_sl_2008-3,"At Hasbro, nothing is more important than the safety and well-being of the children who enjoy our products. Corporate social responsibility is the responsibility that we, as a global corporation, have to the people that develop, manufacture and sell our products, the children and families that use our products, and the communities and environment we live and work in. It is an integral part of how we conduct our business, make decisions, and set our priorities. Our sustainability, quality and philanthropy efforts are at the center of this responsibility and we encourage you to remain up to date on these important initiatives via our website, http://www.hasbro.com/corporate/corporate-social-responsibility/."
hes_sl_2007-1,"We have worked hard over the past five years to reshape our company, build a global organization with strong technical capability and deliver the performance for which we are starting to receive recognition. Our total shareholder return for the year was up 104 percent, an increase that was first among integrated oil companies and tenth in the S&P 500."
hes_sl_2007-2,"We are encouraged by the progress we are making in safety. In 2007, we achieved our best safety performance since the company began recording such data more than 20 years ago. The incident rate was approximately one-third the rate it was in 2000 and has improved seven of the past eight years. While we celebrate our success, we strive for continued improvement by building a culture of safety."
hes_sl_2007-3,"Social responsibility is a core value of our company and we remain committed to making a positive, sustainable difference in the communities where we do business. Our company’s charitable contributions grew from $6 million in 2006 to more than $16 million in 2007 as we provided support for education, health and community development in numerous countries throughout the world. We are particularly proud of the program we initiated in Equatorial Guinea in partnership with the government to strengthen the educational system and of the steps taken in 2007: 100 teachers and 1,000 school directors were trained and the first five of 45 schools were refurbished."
hes_sl_2007-4,"We deeply appreciate the hard work and dedication of our employees. We are grateful to our Board of Directors for their outstanding leadership and guidance. We especially want to thank you, our stockholders, for your continued interest and support"
hls_sl_2014-1,"Our success throughout 2014 is a direct reflection of the 24,100 HealthSouth employees who share a vision of improving the lives of the patients and families we serve. The dedication of 4,100 registered nurses, 5,300 therapists, 8,000 other clinicians, and 6,700 hospital and corporate non-clinical support staff differentiate us from our competitors through a shared commitment to providing high-quality, cost-effective care. This same commitment is also evident in the approximate 4,900 employees of our new partner, Encompass Home Health and Hospice."
hls_sl_2014-2,"Providing high-quality services is at the core of who we are. One key measure of inpatient rehabilitation quality is the PEM score. PEM is the acronym for Program Evaluation Model and is an industryacknowledged measure of an inpatient rehabilitation hospital’s overall performance in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. One of the Company’s corporate priorities for 2014 was to have PEM scores for all HealthSouth hospitals in the upper five deciles (i.e., above 50%), and we are pleased to report all but one of our hospitals achieved this goal. Notably, 35 of our hospitals achieved scores in the 90th percentile."
hni_sl_2006-1,We will continue to leverage HNI’s unique culture and business model to drive continuous improvement. We’re going to continue to emphasize lean. The lean journey is never-ending.
hni_sl_2006-2,"I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all those who are a critical part of our current and future performance. We’re grateful to our members for their dedication and hard work over the past year; to our customers, for the trust they put in us; and to our directors, for their support and counsel."
hni_sl_2006-3,"With our emphasis on agility, fl exibility and adaptability, our model serves us well in any economic environment. This is where our culture and our values shine."
hnt_sl_2005-1,"Thanks go out to our Associates, whose hard work throughout the year was essential to our outstanding performance. We also deeply appreciate the ongoing support of our employer groups, health care providers and business partners."
hnt_sl_2005-2,"We worked hard on improving and expanding our provider networks in 2005. This effort included negotiating new, more favorable rates and expanding networks as necessary. For example, we augmented networks in the Northeast to reduce out-of-network utilization. We entered into new, more cost effective national contracts. We expanded our networks into Washington state. We developed more relationships with national Centers of Excellence for transplantation and other sophisticated medical procedures."
hpc_sl_2014-1,"Incident Free. This is an admirable, but seemingly unachievable goal in our industry. But we know this goal is achievable across our organization, as our liftboat division has completed two full years with no recordable incidents and no lost time incidents. Overall, our 2014 results for Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) and Lost Time Incident Rate (LTIR) are consistent with our best annual performance and remain better than the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC) and IADC U.S. Waters averages. Coinciding with our TRIR and LTIR results, our 2014 Severity Rate, a measure of lost days relative to total manhours, remains near a historic low. These results can only be achieved through significant training and investment in our people, which pays dividends over the long term as we compete for work."
hpc_sl_2014-2,"Compliance, like our investment in safety, is a conscious decision that pays long term dividends. Compliance with international operating and legal standards is non-negotiable, regardless of the operating environment, and was at the core of our rationale to depart from Angola last June. While that decision came at a heavy cost to current business, we believe the risk to future operations outweighed such costs"
hpc_sl_2014-3,"As Hercules Offshore embarks on our next decade of operations, we must operate under perhaps the most challenging environment that the industry has faced in 30 years. Our perseverance and ability to manage through these challenging times will be tested. We have already made some tough choices as we adjust to the changing business climate, and will move quickly if more actions are needed. Through it all, we remain committed to safeguarding our people and assets, providing reliable and cost-effective services to our customers, focusing on our core competencies, and staying opportunistic to create value. I am confident that with the continued strong leadership from our Board of Directors combined with the hard work and dedication of our workforce, we will persevere and set our company up for our next 10 years and beyond."
hpq_sl_2001-1,"Tough times require tough choices. Although we tried to avoid workforce reductions, the economic downturn cast a harsh light on the competitiveness of our cost structures. We simply could no longer ignore the imperative to rebalance our workforce. Nearly 6 percent of the workforce was laid off, across 48 countries. In some countries we are still working through local laws and local workers’ councils, but we expect the process to be complete by the end of fiscal 2002. Once we made that very difficult decision to ensure the future health of our company, we tried to conduct the process with dignity and respect."
hpq_sl_2001-2,"Our customers tell us that we continue to improve our focus and responsiveness. The Total Customer Experience metrics and programs noted in last year’s annual report are causing us to think and act differently. We see hard evidence of increasing customer confidence in our competitive win rates, the new customers we’re attracting and our market-share gains in key segments."
hpq_sl_2001-3,"We have been growing high-end revenue and market share since Superdome started shipping in volume last January, and the rate of customer acceptance continues to increase. According to IDC, we took the No.1 position in high-end UNIX® server revenue in Q3 of calendar 2001."
hpq_sl_2001-4,"In September 2001, our Build-to-Customer-Order program offered both consumers and enterprise customers the ability to configure and purchase notebook PCs over the Internet and via in-store kiosks. We also continue to improve and release new versions of our ePrime direct procurement model for corporate and large accounts."
hpq_sl_2001-5,"Although this was a year of tight expense controls, we continued to invest heavily in employee development to maintain a thriving and competitive workforce. This year we spent $200 million in development programs, honing skills as well as nurturing employees who show particular promise for a future in our management ranks. We went global with our Accelerated Development Program for managers, and with our Leadership mentoring program, which provides highperforming employees with seasoned guidance and leadership training, both from within our ranks and from outside mentors."
hpq_sl_2001-6,"In 2001, we returned to a performance-ranking system designed to encourage and reward outstanding performance. We also finished our first year of a rigorous program of executive accountability, formalizing executive-level responsibility for business performance with much more comprehensive and aggressive metrics than we have used in the past. In the year 2000, only 200 HP leaders were evaluated based on this system; in 2001, we expanded it to include 2,000 leaders."
hpq_sl_2001-7,"Since our first year in business in 1939, HP has been “giving back” to local communities in the form of significant philanthropic donations of money and time."
hpq_sl_2001-8,"To that end, we have expanded our thinking to consider new models of engagement and new sustainable business and technology solutions to enable more people to participate in the world economy, via information technology. At HP today, we have an extensive e-inclusion team dedicated to exploring and implementing such solutions for viable communities, by leveraging our partnerships, relationships and the intellectual property of the entire company. We are engaged in pilot programs in Central America, Senegal, South Africa and China, to name a few."
hpq_sl_2001-9,"HP Labs in India and China are working specifically to understand local needs and translate them into relevant technology. We also extended our Digital Villages program outside the United States — these are community engagement models where we provide local, senior-level talent as well as technology resources, and work in tight cross-sector collaboration to build useful, sustainable solutions for the community"

hsc_sl_2009-1,Our management scorecard for 2009 refl ects both our commitment and our success to date. It gives our team—and stockholders—a clear roadmap of the strategic priorities and execution focus we have set for ourselves as we continue to build an enduring enterprise:
hsc_sl_2009-2,"Harsco’s future— and the future of our planet—also compels us to reduce our environmental footprint and partner with suppliers and customers to lower theirs. We view environmental responsibility as a matter of integrity, and we’re using process innovation to develop sustainable practices and build competitive advantage. We’ve invested in new technologies for the processing and recycling of slag from metals producers throughout the world. The recycled slag contributes to such applications as road surfacing, cement additives and extenders, fertilizers for agriculture and turf building, and water filtration. We continue to drive our zero waste processes towards environmentally responsible and beneficial commercialization of industrial by-products and by doing so, create viable uses for materials that were formerly designated for landfill."
hsc_sl_2009-3,"Our technology infrastructure gives us greater flexibility to share our market insights and best practices as one team. For example, our Harsco Metals and Harsco Minerals businesses have many synergies and complementary processes that will enable us to offer increasingly comprehensive, knowledge-based solutions on a global scale. These two businesses are now managed under one senior executive, and have begun sharing their technical skills and process expertise to develop innovative solutions for the handling and processing of our customers’ waste streams. Our innovative processes maximize the recyclable metallics and minerals we recover from metals production. Just as important, our processes also yield beneficial commercial applications that help customers reduce the cost and impact of their by-products and contribute directly to a better environment."

ITW’s senior management has an average tenure of nearly 20 years, and in 2009 we drew heavily on the experience of our leadership across the organization in guiding our businesses through many challenges. We were faced with much volatility and uncertainty, leading to many difficult decisions. Our people responded extremely well in so many ways, and we deeply appreciate their commitment to our core strategies and to the long term success of our businesses."

The cost of credit for some likely will go up substantially – for example, we expect larger increases in trade finance; consumer credit (particularly for consumers with FICO scores below 660); and backup lines of credit that support commercial paper issuance. Because of the Durbin Amendment, the cost of banking services will go up modestly, but this will likely affect certain clients far more than others – e.g., customers with low account balances."
